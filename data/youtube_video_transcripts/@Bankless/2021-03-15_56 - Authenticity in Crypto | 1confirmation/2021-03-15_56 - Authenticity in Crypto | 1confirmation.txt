[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan john adams i'm joined with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david fantastic episode lead us into it yeah we had uh nick and richard from one confirmation which is a venture firm in the crypto space and they are particularly dancing the line of playing with fundamentals which is something that this crypto industry is particularly well suited to communicate because this is a very transparent industry but then also playing with narratives the story right and this is not something new to crypto stories are very very important especially in young young firms young startups being able to spin a story is extremely important to attracting investments but in crypto it's always a little bit different everything's a little bit different in crypto in crypto and everything is completely available all information is equally accessible to everyone so now the game is not can you access information it's can you interpret information and then the other game is the narrative game can the narratives that rely that are spun around l1 protocols like bitcoin and ether and other l1 protocols like polka dot and binance chain like are those legit narratives or are those fake narratives uh and then there's also the same narratives around smaller applications um we talked about the narratives behind something like nexus mutual versus you know something more closer to a yield farm there are different narratives that surround these things and they are backstopped by different fundamentals so it's a very interesting dance that must be danced around these two balances and nick and richard of one confirmation do a fantastic job playing on both sides yeah absolutely and the one word that i've kind of added to my arsenal the word of the episode the word of the week right if we're here on sesame street here is authenticity authentic that's what they look for so it's not just fundamentals investing where you're just looking for a set of metrics and revenue and discounted cash flows um they'll they're also very willing to invest in narratives but the narratives have to be authentic the fundamentals have to be authentic for it to be of interest and i think this is a great mental model for you to add to your bankless arsenal is when you're investing in crypto for the long term look for authenticity and these guys showed some very practical ways you you can you can look for it and that's in the first part of the episode so fantastic episode once again david and i are doing a debrief we've done a debrief for you so if you are a premium subscriber

yourself unbanked today thankless nation we are so excited to bring our two guests nick tomano and richard chad there from one confirmation one confirmation is an ultra successful crypto vc firm it is backed by individuals such as peter thiel mark andreessen and her own bankless guest mark cuban uh it is a venture fund with 75 million in assets under management and we're going to talk a bit about their thesis for crypto because i think this is super interesting nick richard how are you guys doing great how are you guys doing good you know it's the bull market we're excited are you guys excited yeah it's pretty pretty fun right now well you guys have been through a few uh bull markets maybe maybe we could start there nick how how is this one shaping up how does it feel uh different or similar to to the previous ones you've been through well i think it feels pretty similar you know anyone in crypto knows that kind of the booms and busts in crypto are unlike anything i've ever seen before in financial markets right because cryptocurrencies are global and the internet is more connected before things always go higher than you think they're going to go and then go lower than you think they're going to go right so i think that's certainly the case now we're in another boom and you know i couldn't tell you whether the crash will be tomorrow or a year from now when we're orders of magnitude higher but i do know there will be another crash and i think you know from the beginning we've taken a long-term kind of venture approach to investing in this space and i think that's kind of what what you really need to do unless you have a trading skill set or something like that which we don't nick since you've been through multiple cycles in these markets and richard as well you can feel free to chime in a lot of you know listeners to podcasts these days perhaps this is their first bull market bowl cycle maybe you could kind of bring our listeners up to speed with the comparing and contrasting of how this particular cycle feels different like what is unique and compelling about this particular cycle versus the cycles that you've experienced in the past well to me and richard you should jump in as well but i mean to me this is the most mainstream bull market that we've had right um and i think nfts are playing a big role in that like i've been in this space kind of nine years or so waiting for a moment where you know my friends my family that are not into crypto uh you know are interested and that time is now i think you know in 2017 icos that kind of happened very briefly but it wasn't the degree to which uh people outside crypto are engaging now so i think um you know in that sense it's more exciting than ever right because this nfts are really relatable to people in a way that nothing else in crypto has and i think the extent to which you know the the mainstream is getting interested is probably not even fully understood by you know crypto people like us one thing i'd like to add um like comparing now to 2017 is like in 2017 you had like icos raised like billion dollar valuations from like just a white paper um but this time around like when you look at the billion dollar valuations of d5 projects like there's actual like cash flow of fees that these protocols are generating like you can maybe make the argument that the valuations uh like the p e ratios are overvalued relative to like how many fees how much fees they're generating but at least there's an actual product for people to use unlike in 2017 well it's just ideas it's interesting richard just a quick follow-up on that you mentioned kind of p e ratios or price to sales ratios in crypto and d5 is actually generating cash flows which is amazing none of that was present in in 2017 uh and and you said you could argue that maybe maybe the valuations are still a little bit too high although we've seen massive growth in in d5 that maybe some would argue would justify this but we also when we look to the stock market we look at p e ratios in the stock market those are those are like at all time highs too well maybe not like all-time highs throughout the course of all human history but uh it it's looking pretty frothy on the stock market side of things too so in that context um what do you think about d5 is it fairly valued well i think it's just kind of a consequence of like the global macro environment where we're in like zero interest rates uh which just pushes up asset prices so like you know the tech sector um like blue chip tech companies like netflix or like a couple hundred p e ratio um and you know people just uh get into more and more risky assets like crypto d5 um so i i think it's kind of like underpinned by like what's going on like in the macro sense so nick and richard we're going to get to nfts in a little bit and i i really like what you were saying nick about nfts being sort of the the mainstreaming event we had we had icos maybe in 2017 but nfts are really uh they almost exist outside of crypto circles right like we're uncovering whole communities we never knew existed they don't know we exist and they're diving down the crypto rabbit hole through nfts this almost seems to be the way from our conversation with with mark cuban a week or two ago that he sort of got super interested in in crypto and fell down the d5 rabbit hole but um i want to talk about this first because i think this sets the context for the rest of the conversation so what would you guys say nick is and we'll start with you it's kind of the the underlying thesis for one confirmation when when you look at this space uh throughout the years whether it was a you know in 20 2013 or with a 2017 cycle or now currently is there one underlying thesis for how this space will involve how do you guys invest yeah i mean i think our thesis is very simple which is we like to back authentic founders that are building products for the crypto community and they're products that kind of we understand as users right i first got into space i was one of the first couple hundred users of coinbase and just really liked the product and hustled my way into you know working at coinbase right um because i was excited about it from a user perspective and that's kind of how we guide all our investments right it's products that we understand from a crypto native perspective led by authentic founders and those two pieces uh you know are are pretty simple you know when you say them but um you know i think it takes discipline to to execute on that thesis uh in a space where there's so much noise so many different narratives and things like that but i think as a guiding kind of principle to investing it's it's helped us uh it's helped us perform pretty well can we talk about this this term authenticity for for a minute so especially in a bull market there's a lot of noise right there's a lot of like copycats there's a lot of things that that seem authentic but but maybe aren't uh how do you determine what's authentic and what's not yeah i mean part i mean the main thing is talking to the founders right um i think one thing i notice from outside investors looking in and things like that is because like bitcoin is uh you know it was founded by satoshi so satoshi disappeared and now it's just this kind of thing that exists with no real leadership people assume that every cryptocurrency is like that but the reality is that bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency like that right and every other cryptocurrency uh is led by a founding team and that founding team is the most important uh aspect of the project right so i think that the first thing you can do when kind of gauging authenticity is uh talk to the founding team uh you know assess the the founding team and their uh engagement with the community uh you know things like that right and and of course and you guys uh like ethereum a lot we do too and i think if you think about authenticity you know ethereum is the the most authentic project in the space led by uh vitalik and you know a really strong community so we kind of that's what kind of got us really excited about ethereum um and it's what gets us excited about every single project that we're investing in richard do you want to add anything to that yeah i think another um good mental model is like assume that like cryptocurrency prices were going to crash like 90 tomorrow like would this founder still be around like building this project and i think for a lot of people the answer is no because they kind of fo mode in and like see the cash grab and like want a piece of it um but you know just from talking from the to the founder you can kind of gauge what their incentives and motivations are and richard that starts to dive into a topic that i want to just unpack a lot more um because the word authentic or authenticity you know we all know what that means but really if you if you go down to the the basement level of it it's a subjective term um so how do you guys define authenticity and and what are signals of authenticity to you nick you talked about you know if or if or richard if you talked about if the if the prices collapsed would they still be here that's a great signal what other signals do you guys look for when you guys and try and vet founders for their authenticity i think community building is is a big part of it right so how are they engaging with the outside world i think you know the way you build a a cryptocurrency uh based project is different than how you build a company and you know i think an authentic founder is is kind of sharing his ideas and engaging with the community in a way that shows kind of genuine interest rather than shilling a narrative right so a lot of this at the end of the day i don't think it's it's a science it's more an art in terms of kind of feel and evaluating people and and projects but um you can certainly you know talk to the founder and get a feel for how they think about the world and and also you know what their historical context is on the space right i think that's a big one for us like particularly in 2017 like when we launched the fund the last boom you know you saw a lot of silicon valley uh you know entrepreneurs leaving google and facebook to to you know start crypto products right uh companies and most you know we sat down and had conversations with a lot of those but most of them didn't have deep historical context on the crypto space and they they didn't they were just trying to build a a crypto based product because it was hot right and you can kind of when you talk to people you can assess what their uh their intentions and motivations are and um and and and what their knowledge and historical context is and those are i think really important signals for us and how we think about investing one thing i like to add is like i think there's a difference uh between like crypto vcs and traditional vcs and that like traditional vcs like to look at uh like polished founders who are really good at like building a company like really good at hiring management like like shielding like a narrative um but for like the archetypal crypto founders they're really good at like building a community which is like a very uh different skill set because you're not really like managing any employees uh you're really trying to get a really passionate group of believers um to like really evangelize the project for you um and that's just a very different uh framework and skill set for like the archetypal crypto founders relative to the traditional like polished uh bc back founders nick you were talking about how um you would be able to tell that you know silicon valley startup founders would come to crypto and make a crypto product because it was hot maybe not because they actually believed in in this subject and this is something i've been thinking about a lot lately where there is it's if there's a difference between and and crypto native people like like us like me like ryan like you guys can really tell when somebody else is crypto native or not like we can sniff you out like we've got we've got that kind of like that ability right we know who's real we know who's fake but does that come out in the person or does that come out in their product because in 2017 it was very obvious that somebody some people would make a startup and then they would slap a token on it and then they would call it crypto and that was a very easy way to identify if they are really about the crypto life so like where when you when you are sniffing out fake crypto people who are trying to come in and build something in crypto where where does where does that uh where do they leak the fact that they are you know perhaps not here for the right reasons and how do you guys um parse the parse out uh people that are crypto like quote unquote here for the right reasons or just kind of here just to to be here because it's frothy yeah what are the tells well i think uh you know historical context is probably to me one of the biggest ones right like if you're building a stable coin but you don't know about you know all of the past attempts at stablecoins for example um in depth then that's a tell that you're doing stable coins because it's a hot thing rather than because you understand it deeply and um you know and can figure it out so i think um that you know just it's not rocking science but talking to founders and you know you kind of have to have deep historical context yourself to uh you know to do that and it's not i think it's not easy for for everyone but um but yeah it's the main thing is talking to founders right um but you know you could you know if someone's like actual crypto user right like if you're building a d5 product but you're not actually using uh d5 products then to me that's another tell right um and there's you know you'd be surprised how many uh you know founders that we've seen over the past couple years that uh you know want to build something on ethereum but they don't use they don't use metamask right so things like that um but at the end of the day it's you know i think the main thing is talking to founders you know what blows me away too nick is it it's not just uh your founders who aren't actually using d5 it's investors too you know sometimes investors with large assets under management like millions of dollars i'm talking about who are investing in this space practically blind like they're doing the narrative investing because they haven't actually plugged in and started using defy this is part of the reason david and i started bankless is it's just because like if you actually use defy so if you're listening to this guys and you're actually using d5 products and tools like on an everyday basis on a weekly basis you have an edge because many investors i don't know if you guys would say most but i would say a lot that i've seen don't even go to to that extent they don't use a concerning amount yeah a concerning amount and they're just throwing money at this space without actually understanding how it works and if you don't use the products how in the world do you understand how it works richard you want to say something about that yeah i mean i think that's right i think another advantage for us is uh because we're so crypto native in like early users of a lot of these projects um like a good source of deal flow actually is just to you know live in these discords of like new projects that are up and coming um and like kind of check out the early community like beta tests the project you can like also message the founder on disk or telegram um so like you really get a feel for like where like the latest like up and coming trends indeed by like what those are like yeah living in the discord is really like basically that's that's living in the community right because these communities are are completely digital and that's the work that that you have to put in in order to do this um can we talk about something else dude because i feel like david and i had a a bear market crypto founders series we did this back in like um september i think david right and we brought on like stani from ave we brought on kane from synthetics we brought on hugh from nexus mutual and these are all d5 protocol founders who started in like 2017 2016-17 but they persisted through the bear market right when everyone said crypto was dead d5 was nothing smart contracts would never work ethereum is a you know a pointless platform these teams kept building through the bear run right and if you talk to them during that time you could see that there was authenticity because you have to have authenticity if you're going to stay when all the tourists leave right i feel at some level it's easier to find authenticity during the bear market if you have conviction you can find these authentic founders because everybody else is left right the people who are just trying to be the johnny come lately they're gone and you just have the authenticity but it gets harder during bull runs it gets so much noisier so is your strategy to do is is it better to just deploy capital during the the bear runs and find the on authenticity that way or can you still find that authenticity during the the bull runs and what advice would you give around that yeah well that it's a really good point and we think a lot about this i mean even dating before d5 right um you know like when i was started at coinbase in in 2013 um you know six months or so after i joined uh there was a bitcoin boom right and we saw a ton of companies get funded that were coinbase competitors um you know companies like circle and zappo and uh you know raised lots of money from big vcs right and uh and good teams um but they weren't uh you know they weren't the right product at the right time basically and they weren't the authentic team doing doing it right and they uh you know they did they didn't work out as well right so i think what we really try to do is think about what's going to be hot in two years and try to invest in that right so you know for before uh d5 became really hot we um you know invested in maker dow and nexus mutual and others and um you know those became really good investments when d5 got hot and you know we didn't plow into d5 in defy summer right now that that um you know could have been a mistake and it certainly it could look like a mistake in the short run because things are higher now even than they were right but for us as a smaller fund like that's the discipline that that we like to approach things with where um you know we invested in openc in 2018 and uh and super our last year and now nfts are incredibly hot right those were the authentic teams that were doing it before the thing was hot and so i think that's really where we want to be investing right is like where uh people what's going to be really hot in a year or two and and think about like you know what are the products that we get excited about that aren't hot right it's easy to be excited about products when everyone thinks it's it's it's hot and and that's the case with nfts right now right but you kind of um need to filter out the noise in a lot of ways and just think about what excites you and what the future might look like i guess that's how you know we like to approach things so so guys when we talk about authenticity um can you give us some examples right so so nick you said ethereum was an example um david and i listed some bear market founder projects that we feel like are probably examples yeah i'm wondering if you would agree but can you compare and contrast uh like d5 protocols or or projects in this space that are clearly authentic versus some that aren't we want you to name some names here if you're willing to do that um okay well look i'll give an example that you guy i'm curious how you think of of this one but um because i know you know you like ethereum a lot right and there's a lot of uh you know next-gen uh you know layer one smart contract platforms right that's obviously been a huge narrative the past uh four years and you know eos and uh different projects like that uh captured you know billions of dollars in market cap from just a narrative right basically and so there's certainly a lot of those types of of projects but you know there's a few that we think are are authentic and that actually could have legs right and it's not to say we think they could displace uh ethereum but we think that they're led by you know real founders that have kind of new ideas that are pushing the space forward right and you know one of those would be polka dot right so polka dot uh you know gav wood um you know he was one of the founders of ethereum right and wrote a lot of the initial code and he has some ideas in terms of radical on-chain governance that um that are are kind of new and pushing the space forward in different ways um and again you know we love ethereum and it's not to say that uh you know polka dot is going to completely displace ethereum we don't we don't think that but we think that that's an authentic project that is actually doing some interesting things to push the space forward led by you know a team and if you want to name some names of you know projects that are uh you know kind of trying to do that but aren't really authentic you know you know you could talk about some of the vc chains like uh near protocol and uh i i don't even richard probably knows that dfinity is a big one dfinity is is inauthentic is that what you're saying inauthentic yeah why would you say that uh i mean they're they're taking a very uh silicon valley approach where you like make it closed source you hire like a world-class research team and like pay them a lot of money um and you just kind of go heads down build a product kind of in stealth mode uh without giving like any consideration to building a community around your project and like like if they ever launch first of all um like assume that they launch um like the question is like how are they gonna build a developer community if they've just been like heads down in stealth mode for so long without kind of evangelizing the platform and getting organic community developers like what vitalik and ethereum have been doing i think it's a really important yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't rule out dfinity i mean at some point you know this silicon valley approach of just heads down and launched something in it you know and it works uh could happen it hasn't happened to date it doesn't mean it's not going to happen i think you know the dfinity team is a uh you know is a real team um and so to me it's not one of i wouldn't bucket it as kind of uh you know one of the worst uh offenders of just a narrative based thing but i i generally agree um that it is you know the the the they haven't taken a community approach that you need to uh in crypto and there's something i want to parse apart here and it's really i think what is going to be the through line for this whole entire episode is like the the dichotomy between uh authenticity which i think we could also talk about um soul in that and and i'll get it i'll parse that apart as well and then the other side of things is data and just like raw facts and which is something that we're definitely going to get into later in this podcast and something we haven't gotten to yet and but to go back to what you guys were talking about about polka dot and i would say and and i think i can speak for ryan here as well is like the reason why we don't talk about polka dot very much is because it doesn't have full blocks among other reasons um but uh i consider myself a full block blockchain maximalist so if your blockchain has full blocks i will talk about it right because you can't fake that and the reason why you can't fake that is because filling up a block full of transactions is expensive and you can't no one wants to burn their money just to create a fake narrative right and so your blockchain that has full blocks therefore has the community filling those blocks and i think we and you guys know perhaps know more about dfinity than i do but we can see like maybe their intentions are totally correct and they're building some of the sickest technology ever but when you miss out on the community side of things you miss out on like this soul side of things this is a bottom-up revolution and if you don't have a bunch of just randomly dispersed people all over the globe believing in your project and filling up your blockchain with blocks that have good data in it good transactional volume in it then you don't have any soul right like you don't have a community you don't have this like because this is a populist movement and we need the populace to saturate the blockchain and so there's this one part like we need the data there to verify it and we also need the technology that's uh crypto native technology as well one ca one counter i'd say to that david is real quick um is what what nick and one confirmation told us earlier is that they like to invest in things before they're big right so like so like the whole point of uh you know polka dot doesn't have full blocks you know maybe nick and richard you guys would say exactly right because we want to capture things before they actually hit their their peak valuation than after i don't know what you'd say to that nick but oh that's exactly what i was going to say right ethereum there was a moment in time when ethereum didn't have full blocks right um so yeah i think it's it's thinking about kind of what the project is doing to push the space forward as well right so i would to me one of the reasons why polka dot is really interesting is at this point i don't know if you guys would agree but from my perspective ethereum has effectively the same governance as bitcoin right it's rough consensus you need agreement from the miners the developers and the users to push things forward and you know vitalik is the benevolent dictator and uh in some ways and and that's you know that's not a bad thing that's just he's got a lot of power in the ecosystem and he's still around and he can push things through so ethereum has been able to change more than bitcoin but it's still relatively slow right so i think if if you're going to be kind of what comes after ethereum having this kind of radical on-chain governance and council system where the uh token holders can uh you know can vote to make changes and and amend the system at a much faster rate that is uh is interesting to me and i think there's a community that uh that likes that right and and wants to have more power and so if you think about you know blockchains is really empowering in individuals it makes sense and governance has of course been a big narrative over the past four five years but um to me like a system like polka dot that has this kind of uh user empowerment in a way that uh existing chains don't and you have kind of you know interesting tech that's what uh what excites me about polka dots so i'm curious what you guys my so my thought on on polka dot is i agree what you're saying uh about there being some authenticity there in in particular with kind of the development team like they're actually building that new things and also it seems to be the case that there's a community there um also i would say with some other projects that are you know some buckets similarly like cosmos i mean there seems to be a real community in the cosmos um by the way where it's okay so like those are atom tokens where i um get tripped up on these other chains is actually not whether um these chains have communities or not or whether they're authentic or not it's it's more about uh value accrual to the underlying token right so if you think about something like like bittorrent for example massively successful peer-to-peer network but had no value accrual mechanism i suppose until tron bought them right but like so massive amount of value creation but very little value accrual and so the way i think about these different crypto assets is through the lens of it's either a capital asset producing cash flows it's a commodity like a transformable good or it's a store of value money and i see that assets like dots or assets like atoms are very much more capital than the capital assets so they're going to produce some revenue they can also be commodities because you know they go to pay for block space but because of the things like because of some of the things like um on-chain governance which which someone says that's a form of plutocracy that's how our corporations are managed so no knock against on-chain governance but the question is does it disclude them from that third category of being a store of value money that bitcoin certainly fits under and increasingly ether has started to fit under two and if that's the case then you kind of value these other tokens more like uh layer twos more like um you know they they are layer ones in a sense but they don't necessarily have that monetary premium attached to them um so their capital assets essentially discounted cash flows that's how you can you can value them growth into the future that's where i get tripped up around some of these other chains and then i see the valuations of them and the valuations of some of these things again with empty blocks right now you know um it the valuations are almost as if they're pricing in some sort of long-term monetary premium uh as a as a percentage of bitcoin or percentage of eth and so that's my big question actually with these other changes it's less do they have real communities it's more how does the value accrual of the underlying uh token work out and are they going to be long-term cryptocollateral monies or not maybe you guys don't think about it in that way but i'd be curious no i do i mean yeah no i think it's a good point i think look it remains to be seen how these assets are going to be valued in the long run right and there's lots of people that have created their own models to to do that and um and yeah i mean the kind of store value versus capital uh asset framing i think is an interesting one um i think though at the end of the day what gives a a a cryptocurrency value is a community that believes it has value right and so i think the truth right now is that every cryptocurrency is a is just kind of being treated as a store of value and even the defy stuff you know there's cash flows that's exciting um but nothing in defy is really being valued like that right now right it's just it's being val everything is just a a meme an idea that a community believes uh you know the thing has value and i don't think look the what we know about memes is that most of them are fleeting right and i think you need to have some kind of fundamental framing for why it has value over the long term why people are going to continue to believe it has value i think for polka dot in particular there is kind of this interesting uh you know potential uh reason which is you need uh to own dots to connect to um you know the main chain right and that's uh you know there's a good argument right now that well will people really want to spend millions of dollars to do that um when you know everything's open source and you could you know pay much less to get the same technology we'll see but um but yeah you know in summary i think every cryptocurrency is is a store value and we very much think of like of dots and atoms in this kind of in the same uh store value frame that we think of bitcoin and eth as that that's very interesting yeah and uh you know good counterpoints i want to ask you about another one that has been making waves recently which is a binance chain so is binance chain authentic or not it certainly has users it has a fair amount of capital how would you guys put it through its lens yeah i can talk about finance chain uh i mean well first of all it has a lot of fake users if you uh look at like the on-chain transactions you can see like hundreds of thousands of like fake transactions to uh pancake swap to kind of uh game the numbers uh but i think finance changes richard before you continue on that can i get your perspective on this question uh do you think that that was uh obviously that's intentional how intentional do you think that is as a result of direct result of cz uh i to be honest don't know like i don't know how much cd is like involved behind with that but um and regardless like my thoughts on finance chain uh it's like very appealing to traders like it's kind of going through the d5 dj in summer of like 2020 uh plus is like going through that like much faster where like for ethereum it took like three months for binance chain it's like probably going to take one month where like you have all these thousand percent apys and these like food farms uh that like all the traders are really excited about but you know traders are like looking for like short-term mercenary capital in like more vc funds uh so we think about projects that are going to be around for five plus years so you know it's not uh like authentic in that um these projects are gonna last for a long time uh like the project's online exchange but like in the short term it's uh really appealing to the traders and like people who like to speculate on those things it's it's funny because binance sort of went through this with um initial exchange offerings it felt like you know time is blurring very much for me but i don't know if that hit its peak in 2018 or 2019 but it was certainly a little bit after the the ico mania phase um but that was shorter and uh you know in order of magnitude less it seems like what you're saying richard is that might play out here on binance chain in a similar way yeah i think they're kind of just like a fast follower like you know how like ieos was like the fast follower to icos then whenever you had finance decks that was a fast follower to swap but that only lasted for like a couple months and then now i see like finance smart chain which is kind of a fast follower to like ethereum g5 so um you know if you're a fast follower and you just kind of copy what's existing but you don't have an authentic community or really like innovate um then i think it's just kind of a short-term trade and not really like a long-term backable project finance seems to be really good at creating narratives um and you know there's a and memes and things like that and that's not really a knock i mean that that's a skill set in some ways right um but i think it can when you do that in these bubbles it can suck a lot of people in that don't really know what they're getting into and then if things turn they're gonna go away right and so i think that's like like you said ryan uh you know fast following in terms of ieos you know they kind of rode that wave after icos but then in sucked in a lot of people but then it kind of went away it wasn't sustainable so you're seeing these you know these kind of fast following narrative based products that um are you know seeming to gain some short-term traction but um yeah i think as richard said you know i think it pays to think about the long term and and if uh something is sustainable or not and the thing about crypto the thing that kind of truthfully just rubs me the wrong way about finance is they are very much uh aggressively marketing and and capturing a lot of new people and that um you know i i i tend to look at i think we think about signaling and counter signaling right and when you see someone kind of signaling so much and so aggressive about marketing that can in the long term uh actually indicate weakness right and so that's what i love about vitalik right like if you look at vitalik metallics tweeted maybe three times in the past uh you know since 2021 started in this bull market right and he's um you know he's not signaling that the counter signal i think is actually what you want to what you want to identify right so and the tweets he's made were just like links to some like esoteric research like i remember he made one for the chinese new year which was interesting so we're circling around the subject of of narratives versus uh authenticity narratives versus what's real uh and uh earlier we made the comments about how you know a lot of people just invest based off narratives and perhaps that's not the best thing because you need the data to back that up um and i want to throw a counter argument in there as well and play play devil's advocate a lot of um ethereum's people well perhaps eth maxis will criticize bitcoin for just being like this meme coin um yet i be and yet i also believe at the same time bitcoin's meme is one of the strongest in crypto but i would say and i would argue that bitcoin's meme comes from the fundamentals the data that backs up bitcoin right like if bitcoin is just a meme coin then go ahead and roll back the chain well you can't because it's bitcoin right you can't confiscate anyone's bitcoin you can't change the hard cap there are all these very real things about bitcoin and because of that because that data is there in my my mental models the data is there and the memes sit on top of the data and when you poke at the memes and you question the memes the memes can can cite the data that's there and there's other projects that are just memes and they are actually aren't sitting on top of anything right and so there's this relationship between memes and data narratives and data and and some projects just spin up narratives and perhaps that's what uh binance smartchain is doing they're just like oh we're going to kill ethereum meanwhile there's the state blow of binance smart chain is putting on like 50 gigabytes every single week right and the implications of 50 gigabytes a week of state bloat is not something that the typical uh individual might be able to understand in their first foray into crypto um and so this is kind of where i want to turn it to the conversation of how you guys at one confirmation play with the the the play the juxtaposition between data and narrative and richard i know you i know you really like to use this thing called dune analytics which is a data analytics platform for ethereum so so maybe we can get that conversation started how do you guys um invest based off narrative and also invest based off of data and how do you guys balance these two things yeah look we have institutional investors right and when we raise the first fund a lot of them would ask like how do you how are you making decisions in terms of when to sell for example right are you just uh timing things based on uh you know what you think when you think something's overbought or technical analysis or things like that and you know we had to think deeply about uh analyzing all of our investments from a fundamentals perspective and so for every investment we make you know we're thinking about uh risk reward right we want uh you know investments that can be 20x if they work uh and if they don't work they could be zero and then we kind of you know evaluate the fundamentals um on a quarterly basis and for every project that we invest in we have kind of kpis that were you know we're looking at and so you know you mentioned bitcoin and i think your your point about bitcoin uh it was a good one um but what we look at for first all of our store and value investments right is how many addresses on chain uh have over a couple hundred dollars worth of cryptocurrency right as a proxy for how many people actually believe in this thing as a store of value and so because nick they believe in it enough to hold it on chat exactly so the like the the on-chain data you know doesn't lie right and that's when we look a lot after we you know make our initial investments and bets on teams we're analyzing the on-chain data to see what's real and what's just narrative right and so if you look at bitcoin for example you know the bitcoin uh the number of addresses with over a couple hundred dollars worth of bitcoin uh has increased uh you know pretty significantly over the past year and so that's real data that supports that yes this uh belief of bitcoin as a store of value is growing now one of the interesting things uh about eth and i know you guys are kind of ethan's money sort of value um the the the number of addresses with a couple hundred dollars worth of uh of heath is increasing at a faster rate right now right so we kind of we believe that um eth is becoming kind of this store value for the people and bitcoin is becoming this store value for institutions right so we like looking at data like that get you know allows us to kind of assess uh you know our conviction and you know our conviction on eth as a store of value is actually increasing based on this data wow okay store value for the people versus store of value for the institutions and what you're saying is this is not just um meme narrative following what you're saying is you you're able to back this through on chain data and real world metrics yes that is super cool um i'm curious before we leave the store value category because i think we want to get to some other categories where you're doing this what else is in the store of value category for you besides bitcoin and ether uh dots atoms and i think that's it richard am i missing anything i think uh maybe ksm that's like a light i don't think you know because you're not very light two dots uh basically like layer one change like have the upside of becoming stored value super fascinating okay cool all right guys we're gonna have to take a quick break in the action there is so much left in it this podcast after we get back from the break we talk about what metrics richard looks at to check for verifiable authenticity on chain directly on the ethereum blockchain and we also continue the conversation about fundamentals verse narrative and when when do fundamentals come into favor versus when narratives come into favor and then we also finish up with a conversation that because ethereum is completely transparent this informational advantage is gone and it's replaced by having skills to be able to interpret and digest the data versus having political connections and friends and relationships that offer access to information that other people don't have we ask how richard and nick think this will change the future of d5 investing really a fantastic conversation don't go anywhere because we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got back into crypto back in 2017 and it has been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various crypto assets including many of the hot d5 tokens like

them out gemini.com go bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave dot com let's talk about some other things then um maybe maybe in the d5 sector i know you guys have some investments there what kpis you look for and you how you find that verifiable authenticity on chain sure i mean one that comes to mind is like nexus mutual which is like a d5 insurance project and like the very obvious kpi is an active cover amount which is basically how how many what's like the total amount of cover policies that are currently active right now um like it just hit a billion dollars like a couple weeks ago um and like it's had incredible growth uh i think it's like over 100x in the last year um this is like one where um like a lot of people for nexus like to look at you know the capital pool and the token price as like their kpis uh but i think the more important thing is the active cover and launch uh because like while it's not directly uh tied to like the token um if the fundamental kpis of the project are increasing eventually there's going to be some sort of margin of safety um such that the token price is going to catch up to its fundamentals and like that's kind of how i feel with nexus right now richard for the for the benefit of those watching on youtube you actually put together a dashboard on this would you be able to send that to me so i could display that sure the the url is uh nexuscracker.io and and richard yeah richard built that i mean richard's kind of uh being humble here but richard built that and uh you know it's become a really important resource for the the nexus community um so yeah anyone that's interested in nexus should check out nexus tracker and uh there's a lot of good data for what's happening on chain there so yeah this was before uh doing analytics existed yeah i had to do all the hard work of parsing all the data but like unfortunately now it's way easier to spin up with doom dashboard than to build us your own custom site oh we'll definitely get to dune i you know i remember including you know images of nexus tracker and in bankless uh newsletters previously it's it's fantastic that you're the one who created this the whole time um all right so what were the metrics that you were just talking about that you look like i imagine they're on this dashboard yeah yeah i mean the top ones active cover amounts uh annualized premiums and force that that's uh like a really fancy way of saying uh annualized revenue but uh kind of an insurance lingo um so like at the current rate they're making close to like 20 million dollars a year in revenue um just from just from covers like there's other revenue sources such as the sales spread and also investment earnings so we could think of that 20 million per year as their annualized projected revenue basically if we were to compare this to some other capital asset like equity yeah and so one of the conversations that it's important to have about nexus mutual is that the token has not perhaps followed the revenue metric which is something that we might have expected if in more efficient markets right that's the gist that i'm getting out of this conversation so we have the data because of you know thank god for ethereum it's this inside out platform we can consume all the data we want yet the token price is doing things that are different from what we would expect the data to show so is that where the narrative aspect comes in and so like what's the relationship between the nexus mutual and the nxm token price and then the the nexus mutual revenue like explain that relationship to me yeah i think one thing that's very different uh between nexus and like nxm and all these d5 coins is that the nxm token is constrained by a formula the the bonding curve so it's like directly tied uh to the capital fuel size uh versus uh other coins like say chainrink uh where it can just like trade up like based on narratives like for nxm price to increase you actually have to uh deposit more money into the capital pool uh and like there's a formula that ties the capital amounts to the token price um which is good and bad it's good in the sense that like it's tied to like some sort of underlying fundamental and you can think of it as like a leveraged bet on ease based on like how much the project grows relative to eve it's bad in the sense that you can't get these like speculative like 10 20 x bubbles um that are really exciting uh that you can with like other new d by coins richard i remember a vcc once telling me this is you know pretty crypto that um the most interesting companies were always the pre-revenue companies those were the ones who had the big valuations because investors could kind of like imagine what future revenues were and once you start actually generating revenues and they can see that and they can measure your growth rate well evaluation tends to kind of collapse because i suppose it's less narrative driven less people imagining the possibilities in the future it's more grounded in the real world seems to be what you're saying is is kind of happening here some tokens with no revenue fundamentals are just absolutely going on monster tariffs due to narrative and but once you get revenue and fundamentals in your token that can kind of constrain your narrative power yeah that's correct um i also like to say that like for nexus like for a brief period of time um the nxm the wnxm token which is like a wrapped version of nexus that's really tradable on exchanges it was trading below book value uh which like is like as like honestly i don't think that's ever happened before in like any g5 project so basically what that means is um the the amount of ether in the capital pool is worth more than uh the total market cap of nxm so basically if all the nxm token holders decided tomorrow that we're just going to return money back to um token holders uh you would end up having more eth than what you paid to buy that token um and like that's just that was just an incredible like undervalued uh asset that a lot of uh smart investors like fundamental focus investors decided uh to buy that was a good time to buy an exam that's absolutely crazy looks because to me that tells me that the power of the narrative side of investment can just dwarf this side of fundamentals based investment and it that kind of tells me that the ratio between narratives to fundamentals in this space is like 90 10 or something some something some crazy juxtaposition like that where like the narrative is actually so how do you guys think that this skews investments when the returns on investments is theoretically so much narrative based rather than fundamentals based how does that skew capital allocation in this industry i i think that's short term though right like our our bet we're making long term five to ten year bets and our view is that yeah narratives work in the short term but when it's just narrative uh the narrative runs out and and then there's nothing right so you know we want to be investing in i think narrative is important it's i'm not dismissing it we want to be investing in projects that have good narratives but underlying fundamentals as well right so i think what you don't want to be doing is investing in just narratives um because there's some people that know there's a lot of ways to make money so that i'm not saying that people you can't do well by this but i just it's not the game we're playing we're playing kind of long-term uh investing in strong fundamentals also backed by good narratives right i think you really need both to uh you know to to have 20x kind of upside potential in the long run which is what what we're doing but i i like because these are public i think it's it's a lot what i always say is like you need to approach crypto investing like venture investing right where it is kind of a long-term uh perspective and you're not uh making decisions based on 50 moves you know one way or the other right um it's easier said than done because you know these are publicly traded and you know it it is alluring to you know focus on what's hot on twitter and what's hot and on price and things like that well it's one thing we say on on bankless is uh you have to decide what type of investor you're going to be in crypto it's either one of three you're fundamentals investor which means you're doing the hard work that richard's doing here or you're a narrative investor which means you're looking at you know three to six month timelines and you just you're just going on the next narrative trying to front run that or you're a trader and you have to really pick it's hard to do all three things at once well and the bankless program this is one of your first time listenings you'll find that we skew towards the first which is fundamentals long-term hold um you know and and not the the other two but what you just said nick i think is so important is because as smart people start digging into this data ideally the market gets smarter in general in terms of its its capital allocation right so the more richards we have going through dune analytics and parsing through this this data the more rationalization we can make behind the valuation of the assets in this space and the the market levels up together now i personally i was hoping to see a bit more of that in the 2021 bull run i still feel like there's a lot of garbage in the top 100 coin market cap that that is just narrative driven and not driven by fundamentals but do you think that the market is getting a little bit smarter uh maybe nick your thoughts not really okay and i yeah i think i think memes are like i'm not dismissive of memes by any means right like i think nfts would be a good example to look at right there's no fundamentals underlying nfts other than uh like a community that believes in this nft and that believes it has value right and nfts are going crazy right now there's certainly some type of bubble in nfts and you know a lot of people artists and things like that coming to the space for cash grabs but i also believe in crypto art as a category for example which i think has a chance to completely displace the traditional art world right in terms of of value and what people believe has value there's not uh fundamentals there really it's just kind of belief and so i'm i think fundamentals are great we definitely want to invest in like products that have fundamentals but i'm also not dismissive of memes i think um and i think nfts particular are kind of revealing truth about the crypto space in general that maybe a lot of people don't want to recognize which is that you know there is memes are a big part of of everything that's happening and i don't think that's going to change richard you're going to add anything yeah i think that's right um i think like related to nfts uh there's also like some fundamentals that you can look at is like kind of you know trading volume uh so like maybe like the assets themselves are memes but like you can invest in like the kicks and shovels the infrastructure that's like powering like the nft economy and like that's uh well as well as the impetus for investing in open sea in 2018 and super rare in 2020 um super rare was like actually a really interesting case study uh so like we made the investment like around d by summer when d5 was like really hot but like nfts was still like largely under radar and like a lot of dbi maximalists like dismissed uh nfts but if you look at the dune analytics dashboards um the like the monthly volume for nfts was growing about 55 uh month over month and like at that time like the absolute numbers were still like very small so like you know 55 month over month grow like growth didn't seem like a lot uh but you know if you do the math with uh compound interest like eventually that gets good that gets to like an extremely large absolute number like as you can see here in the graph um like in february it just like completely exploded so that that's like a good source of alpha for like finding like these underrated gems that are going to explode in a few months i do want to get your guys's opinions on the cyclicality of this whole narrative versus data debate where my gut take is that in bull markets things are primarily narrative and in bear markets data and fundamentals take over uh and ryan earlier mentioned our dr bear market d5 founder series where we uh interviewed kane from synthetics donnie from ave and there are and the in bear markets those projects weren't narratives because there was no narrative in the bear market things were dead there was only fundamentals there was only reality so how do you guys think that on these market cycles how do you think the cycles of narratives versus fundamentals follow the the market cycle can you guys explain that relationship well i think in terms of narrative like i i think dismissing like narrative based coins completely is uh is wrong right like i think what you want to invest in is narratives that more people are going to believe over time right and so bitcoin as an example is a narrative is an authentic narrative that you know increa just more and more people are believing and that's what allows it to capture value so we certainly are investing in narratives that we believe are just going to grow over time um i think having certainly having fundamentals that underlie it in some way is important um and that's a good indication of kind of you know a narrative that's going to last over time if the if the fundamentals uh you know exist through kind of bull markets and bear markets but um but yeah i think you know fundamentals are certainly good but we're like we're not saying that we're just investing in in fundamentals at all i think i think narrative is and and the meme is an important critical uh component of of any cryptocurrency it's interesting because it's kind of almost a semantic thing right because what you're saying is that narratives can have fundamentals and the narratives can be authentic and you can see that authenticity like on chain in all sorts of various ways so it's not not that you're not investing in narratives but you're investing in narratives with some fundamentals behind them let's use the example of people right i don't know you guys and how it's going crazy in value right now yes and would you say there's any fundamentals underlying that yeah they're they're hard to quantify right so i would i would say it's it's fundamentals in the way that's the store of value narrative has fundamentals it's it's cultural expression and it's more people believing that people's art is awesome and wanting more of his his art and that's a that's a fundamental in itself but but i agree it's also part part of this meme socially constructed narrative right the only fundamentals that i would say are behind people's art is the fact that humans have liked art for forever but that doesn't need mean that necessarily people's art is what's going to be enjoyable but clearly it is because people paid millions of dollars for it yeah so we i mean we bought a people piece for the fund um and so you know people listening might say well you guys were talking about fundamentals but like what's the fundamentals of people artwork right and it kind of that i think that solidifies kind of my point that i think a a narrative a meme is could be a good investment if that meme just grows and grows over time right and so like buying a beeple is a bet on the artist right we think that beeple is a really compelling artist that engages with the community incredibly well online as well and there's a chance that you know people is our generation's war hall or something like that right and the belief in this kind of crypto native digital native artists just grows over time right so that's just an example of this a meme based investment that we you know that we think has a lot of upside i think that's a great articulation of it because i i do think that the the traditional finance world draws things too narratively when they when they use terms like fundamentals they mean that the thing must have cash flows associated with it and you must be able to do a discounted cash flow analysis and analyze it in the way you analyze a stock right um and so they draw far too narrow of a like framing around things that can be valuable and you're saying look things can be valuable and have fundamentals outside of of cash flows right it's just belief what i've been saying is like look there's this there's an institutional narrative that was created for how you value something but i think what we're seeing in 2021 is like the people on the internet are saying this like we we're we're investing in what we believe has value right and i think gamestop is obviously a stock market example of that but it's also happening in crypto and in nfts so um it's it's just belief all right well let's talk this is such a good conversation it's so many good points here um richard i want to come back to another point that we we kind of touched on a little bit and that is this um you know dune analytics dashboard that you put together and this is just an example so um you were talking about monthly crypto art volume and being able to see all of this on chain i think the macro picture here is um what you're doing it appears to me is like like the type of work they do on wall street for stocks where they're combing through quarterly earnings reports basically and coming up with projections and trying to to project out the future of these things the the difference is you have the the superpower of crypto and the blockchain in that you don't have to wait for quarterly earnings reports all of this data is available on chain and if you know how to crunch it and if you know the model behind the the project and kind of the growth sector then you can put together some extremely compelling um analysis on the verifiable authenticity of what's really happening in in these projects and you could do this for nfts you could do it for defy you could do it for anything that's on chain that's really what you're doing here right yeah yeah for sure i mean june like published a manifesto actually like i think a month ago it was like title something like the future of finance will be like real time and basically kind of outline what you said like now we don't have to wait for like quarterly reports annual reports um we don't have to worry that like some enron is going to happen where like they kind of they cook the books and like budge the numbers uh because like the blockchain doesn't lie you can uh get all this data on uh in real time um and like you know it's like authentic um and it's a it's a really good source of output like for like new projects that launch and like you know aren't big enough uh to really have like like any like semblance of like oily reports uh but you can like look at their numbers and see if they're growing like 50 month over month uh then it's like something worth looking at something worth talking to the founder maybe even investing richard why do you publish this open source i'm curious you know in traditional financial a lot of these funds will will take this information keep it secret so they keep the alpha internally why do you guys just publish it on dune oh there's actually a lot of stuff that i keep private on dude so i was using the dune like the free tier for a while uh and then like deep by summer started and like there was like all these farming projects that i was doing but like people were stalking me on doing like asking me projects i was farming like oh i got to like pay for a pro version to like make this finally so like the the the trading alpha is private but like these like long-term like kpis i think are really important for the community to see like how a project is doing like like this stuff is public yeah so all our fund investments right are obviously long-term investments we're um you know the largest investor in super rare and um you know we want people to recognize that super air is uh is killing this market right now right and i think the an interesting thing too about the on chain is that in you know in in silicon valley when founders raise money too it's often all about narrative right it's about a founder that can get in a room uh with vcs and pitch a big vision and there are a lot of founders like that in silicon valley right i think richard mentioned earlier we kind of we like investing in founders that may not pitch great you know in a room in silicon valley right but are building something uh very uh useful and um and i think the dune boards kind of help separate that and still like a lot of like most investors i don't think are are looking at these um but that's you know that's important for us to to uh both you know evaluate new projects but also well you know for our investments we want people to recognize that like look this uh you know super air is the dominant player in the crypto art market despite uh you know a narrative from you know certain people that might suggest otherwise right so with this availability of data that public blockchains offer and specifically with applications like dune where you is dune is really a way to consume data easier it's it's revolutionary that all of this data is equally available to everyone and historically in in previous in legacy finance uh accessing data that other people don't have is a fantastic way to gain edge right getting getting your hands on information and data that other people don't have and you can use that information to place investments that's not true in public permissionless systems because everyone has the data but the difference is that not everyone can consume the data in the same way and not everyone can interpret the data in the same way so it's it's a new game everyone has all of the same information but now that the advantage is not in like personal connections or political relationships so you can get your hands on data that other people have now it's about how well can you consume the data and how well can you interpret the data maybe talk about that transition and how that's going to change the game of investing moving forward if if we do live in this new futuristic ethereum based world or public permissionless blockchain based world yeah i mean um like one big difference with like data on the time chain and like traditional world is like it's all free and like publicly by public access um like for nfts and like art for example um i i also built crypto art io which is like a website to track like total art market cap in like kind of a rankings of like all the artists uh by each individual part like artists market cap um and like you can do the same you can kind of do the same in the traditional art world um there's a website called artnet.com but uh it costs like thirty thousand dollars a year uh to get a subscription to that and like the data is also incomplete uh so um i mean i think it just like revolutionizes the game where like now if you want to be an art investor uh all the data's in front of you uh you can see like how much like other people i've paid for a particular artist's works like historically um and then kind of do like a regression and see like how this artist is like trending over time in like popularity like are there artwork prices increasing over time uh whereas like in the traditional art world um like the art dealers like have a ace of asymmetrical information in that like they know like what the previous uh are like what the previous price the artwork was sold for um and like that's kept secret uh to like the new buyers um and like that's completely changed the game are investing for sure yeah i mean to me transparency is one of the core features of blockchains right and the fact that anyone can see this data about artwork um is really powerful and you don't have to be a rich person who can afford paying a couple hundred dollars a month for art net or whatever you could just anyone can go to crypto art and see see what's happening right so that that's one of the core features of blockchains that we really uh richard in particular who's you know fantastic at data we want to uh take it bring that to light more and and allow more people to recognize that i think i'm falling in love with this uh this boy portrait of vitalik he looks like uh what's it vitalik takes the role of picasso's son it's amazing too bad it just sold for almost half a million dollars so that might be out of my uh my price range but this is this is phenomenal stuff um richard you know one thing david and i often talk about on bankless is the the tremendous um i guess white space of opportunities that are available for people who learn this space and learn it early like just a rough analogy is it's kind of like learning html you know right before the internet right um you're just on the cusp of something you have skills that are in demand that other people will want um it seems like wall street is gonna have to level up like the wall street analyst game that it's it's no longer going to work in this new open permissionless uh crypto economy but i'm curious how how somebody would get started doing some of this stuff doing some of the stuff that that you're doing if they're interested in becoming a you know crypto financial analysts what kind of skills do they need and how do they get started and i think like having like computer science skills or like at least like basic abilities of code is like becoming like more important than ever um and like for example with june like all of it is in sql which i guess you don't need a cs degree to like know how to use sql there's like plenty of tutorials out there to do that whereas you know like with traditional finance analysts they're probably just combing through pdfs and like uh decks uh to like put together the numbers whereas for this um if you like just a couple lines of code i can get you like the same amount of information just like much faster and much easier um i i also think like i know understanding solidity and like at least being able to like read and like parse through smart contracts it's like really a value under like underrated skill especially indeed um i think you know during like the d5 summer uh where there are like all these new projects coming up like if you uh and like a lot of them were unaudited like if you knew your way around solidity and could like at least like do a sanity check or like a dip check of like the smart contract versus like the synthetics mentor contract that they uh borrowed from uh you can see like what's actually going on in these projects and not just you know invest money into a new project just because like it's a good meme and to be clear there's upside in doing this guys i think what richard is saying is learn to code you know learn at least some of the basics but there's some upside in doing this because what you've been saying the whole time is you found treasure this way right you found treasure with with nexus mutual you found treasure in nfts before they were a big deal you were able to predict things using this on-chain data um and front-run opportunities that way is that right yeah yeah that's right i want to ask you the question of what's next of of what you're seeing now that um you know will be the kind of the next big thing uh you you have any thoughts on that do you have any i guess ideas for us or places to look are you gonna keep that alpha internally for uh one one confirmation nick do you want to answer that um well i mean there are some obvious things right i think most people recognize the gas fees right on ethereum right now are not viable for most people and you know i think there's a narrative that uh you know ethereum is becoming a defy and nft platform for uh rich people and there's you know could be an opportunity either for obviously there's a lot of exciting stuff happening on ethereum to change that or for you know other platforms right so we're thinking a lot we're looking at the on-chain data right now take super air super air nfts are working really well for these high dollar value low throughput transactions right so super air if you want to plug super air bot which richard also built which is a really cool twitter bot and if you want to see in real time who's buying uh crypto art and and the artists that are selling it and and uh and monitoring that i i enjoy uh taking a peek in the morning it's really uh it's really just a good way to start the morning but um if you see if you look at that you'll see that there's uh every tr every transaction every uh purchase is uh you know 500 dollars minimum and then you know hundreds of thousands of dollars maximum right so and that makes it works for ethereum because you know fees are anywhere between 20 and 40 right now last time i checked maybe maybe lower today i'm not sure but you know looking at that data and looking at you know nfts for example and seeing that it's mostly high dollar value you kind of can recognize that um you know in the future there's a need for a platform that supports kind of low dollar value high throughput nfts and that's like one example of a big opportunity that we believe in that uh you know that we're not really seeing uh yet and we're thinking a lot about richard you want to follow yeah i mean high gas prices are just like pricing out a lot of like new interesting use cases uh like kind of the the gaming nft like use case like kind of died because of the high gas prices um so you know i'm optimistic you know about uh like layer two stuff uh we we also invested in a project called a hop protocol which is uh providing a really good ux cube bridge between layer one ethereum in layer twos and also between layer twos and layer twos um like a really good ux for that uh without like uh having to deal with like the withdrawal period and like waiting uh to get your money there um so i think a lot of like picks and shovels and like layer 2 scalability stuff um that stuff is really exciting the next few years i want to ask you guys about the changing landscape of investment into into ethereum into d5 and into the greater world of crypto because the the last you know 50 billion dollars of investments into this base is not going to come from the same people or the same you know investor dispositions as the next 50 billion dollars especially what we see coming down the pipeline in this bull market how do you guys think that the people that are looking into crypto now um how will that change the landscape of uh you know memes and narrative versus fundamentals or how how will just the what will shift because of these new players coming into uh into crypto and investing in crypto well i think on the institutional front it's still all bitcoin right so bitcoin is just a very simple story that institutions understand right which is digital gold and so i think that is is going to be a big driver on the institutional front um institutions are not yet buying eth i think it's likely that it's very likely that they will um but right now it the the narrative is still too confusing and you know there's you know the the the eth2 economic improvements haven't happened yet and i think i think there's certainly a a a chance that in the future eth has the economic story that bitcoin has uh plus it's most widely used and that becomes something that institutions get on board with but we're not there yet so i think on the institutional front it's bitcoin for the next you know year probably it's kind of bitcoin and then institutions will allocate to you know funds and things like that that are investing in other cryptocurrencies um and on the individual side again it goes back to kind of bitcoin is a cryptocurrency for the people and i think eth is increa sorry bitcoin is the the cryptocurrency for institutions and eth is increasingly uh the cryptocurrency for the people i think if you look at the use cases that are bringing people in right now it's all ethereum right so i think there's a really strong story uh that that is going to continue um and you know there's also other chains that i think are are doing interesting things i mean obviously top shots is an example of a project that is bringing in new people i think we're likely to see more of those as well as is kind of a view that i have i think up until now we've been mostly focused on these crypto native and that's what we that's what we love that's what we mostly invest in but we're we're closer than ever to just products like top shots that aren't really crypto native at all but uh you know bringing are interesting products that bring in new people so that's that's a i guess a uh general view of how i see you know the new people coming in over the next couple just a quick follow-up on that nick and then i'd love to hear richard's richard's thoughts on this too but um what do you make of some of the nfts being priced and denominated in eth right now is that part of the story value for the people narrative or do you think that's just a passing thing that you know nfts won't always be denominated beneath they just are right now no i think they probably they will i mean our whole thesis on crypto art in particular was like just like uh the rich people like traditional art crypto rich people like crypto art right and so i think i i i i think eth is kind of the on-ramp and you know you can buy nfts on for usd on nifty and things like that but we're most excited about kind of the on-chain uh stuff like openc and like super rare and certainly i think uh more more people that i'm hearing from and talking to especially new people i mean i heard from a friend today that's really gotten excited about crypto and he's asking me what should my nft allocation be and so his you know he he recognizes that eth is kind of you know should be the the biggest and and bitcoin as well but they're they're they're kind of thinking within that allocation should it be five percent nft should it be 20 nft so i definitely think it's first bitcoin and ethan cryptocurrencies and then nfts for most people and and most people will continue to think about nfts uh in eth terms fascinating that is being used oh sorry i was just gonna say fascinating that eth is being used as money in the nft scene uh go ahead richard yeah yeah i also have the data to back that up that like people are thinking about nfts in terms of ease so like um if you look at like my super rare dune dashboard you can see like the average artwork price over time like there's like a usd graph and an eath graph um so like a commonly asked question is like well these prices are just going up because each is pumping so like in dollar terms they're also like pumping but you can see from the graph that uh eath has like relatively kept its value um as like the dollar price of eat increases so that means people collectors generally think of artworks in terms of eth uh rather than usd and like the stuff isn't getting more expensive in dollar terms wait so i want to i want to unpack that just a little bit so euler beats let's use euler beats as an example um only price in each you can only buy it with eth price and so if if the eth price 2x's are you saying that that does not mean that the euler price euler beats nfts are also 2x or are they 2x uh 2x in terms of dollars or you know dollars yeah wait so so ether price goes from a thousand to two thousand dollars and because euler b nfts are only purchasable by eth how does that impact the evaluation of the euler beats nft oh i see and then the graph like in like the dollar terms would a double but the east uh would stay flat and like what what you want to see is that the east graph you don't ignore the dollar graph just look at the each graph and make sure that it stays flat or goes up and does it or and doesn't go down as like the eighth price each usd ratio increases so this just adds more narrative behind the the meme of digital art is priced in eth yes one interesting thing i think it still remains to be seen how collectors think about uh about like east appreciation so an example is uh in uh january when uh you know eth price was mooning um there were some collectors on super air that felt underexposed to eth and and wanted to sell their nfts to to get more eath because eath is way more liquid right so there's like uh there's the kind of liquidity discount that comes with nfts and so i think most nft holders and even the artists that are i think people underestimate how many new artists are coming into crypto and uh ethereum is their on-ramp and how they're getting paid and and they're sure some of them are are going to coinbase and cashing for for cashing out for dollars but a lot of them kind of recognize eth um as this kind of valuable store of value and uh and and are holding it and i think it's a really awesome way to bring in new people to crypto that's fascinating that that's such a new development that's come with nfts and it's so exciting to see um you know some people in the crypto sphere have thought about eth in money terms and certainly like you know we talk about bank list denominating your wealth in in units like eth and bitcoin um but for art collectors to come from non-crypto worlds and start being exposed to that natively and for artists themselves and creators themselves that really is new that does feel like a new on-ramp to the stuff is money maybe maybe richard um you know kind of the same question to you of do you think anything's going to be different during this cycle as a result of of all of these new entrants any additional thoughts they're adding to what nick said uh i mean like during this cycle like we're bridging mainstream like more so than like any other cycle uh like you know in 2017 icos like sure there were like a couple of uh like smart sophisticated people who knew how to like flip these icos but like now in 2021 with nfts uh you just have to be a fan of the nba or like uh or like are interested in art to like participate in nfts and i think that's like really like appealing to a lot of people because like finally like ethereum you know it's not just about uh money in like financial use cases it can also be about culture and entertainment and like that's relatable to everyone all right guys um this has been so insightful i think david and i want to conclude with uh just getting your sounds on some predictions for for this bull run um the first question i have is are there any current narratives that you think are going to die by the end of this bull run i felt like in 2017 one narrative that died a withering death maybe was the ico narrative and the utility token narrative do you think anything any narratives in vogue right now that that seem really popular will die by the end of this bull cycle that's a good question um nothing comes to mind a lot of the 1000 apys uh that's less of a narrative but it's like a short-term trade yeah that's a good point i mean the yield farming stuff i don't think the yolo farming is going to die like icos but there's been a lot of you know sketchy yield farming opportunities that people have done well on and it it feels like in some ways that is fizzled out to some degree richard i don't know if you agree it's it's moved over to finance oh yeah there's yield farming on binance now i didn't yeah yeah finance marching well in theory the yield farming apys should just like kind of collapse down into just yield on ethereum right no 10 that's still high compared to the original world but like that's normal in crypto world yeah one i mean one kind of idea here that i'm not sure about i think i i don't feel strongly one way or the other but this idea of governance tokens on ethereum um that's i don't think that's gonna die but it may look different like i think the reality is most government governance token has been like a regulatory arbitrage in some ways a way to launch a token uh without it being a security and i'm not sure how that's going to play out long term but most of the governance tokens there's not real governance happening and i don't know i'm unsure of how that's going to play out and nick many of the governance tokens do not have a fee revenue attached to them they just have the possibility of future fee revenue attached to them and and value the valuations are implying that that you know that the fees will be passed to token holders right but if you know these if you really believe in kind of governance minimization and like it being really hard to change things then can that is that actually going to be changed i'm not sure so um we'll see i i mean i think obviously i i i like i mentioned polka dot earlier i i like kind of this idea of having councils um you know to make decisions and it's certainly um it's you you made the point that oh maybe that looks exactly like a company um i think it's somewhere in between right it's not exactly a company users do have some power and um but it but it's kind of more centralized and can can uh create uh you know faster decision making and improvements than you know a uh consensus type governance so interesting all right guys any any other predictions for for 2021 then anything around nfts d5 how big this cycle is going to get how long it will last yeah that's what i want to know how long do you guys think this cycle's going to go for i i look i don't make uh you know predictions like that um you know i don't have a good feel um other than i would say i think nfts are going to be it's going to continue longer and it's going to be bigger than a lot of people think and i think the important thing to recognize about nfts is that they're unregulated investable assets right so these are clearly not securities there's a very strong legal argument that that's the case and i've been waiting since um you know i don't know if you've got some listeners may remember ether bots ether bars was one of the first ethereum projects that did a uh pre-sale of digital goods and they sold a million dollars worth of uh you know of of nfts for some uh you know robot based game and i thought back then there was just going to be an explosion of these pre-sales and the numbers were going to get really big um and i i don't know why it didn't really happen but it just never did and i think there's a chance that that could happen in a really big way this time around right so we saw blau uh you know last weekend do uh i think something like 11 million in uh you know in sales of his uh you know nfts for his album and i think this could get really big and we start seeing a lot of mainstream people and there's going to be cash grabs there's going to be you know people that are thinking about it long term and do it authentically but i think you know nfts as unregulated uh you know investable assets is uh you know is important and it could get uh really big richard what about you hit us with some predictions predictions i actually uh wrote a blog post beginning of 2020 about like three under three at our predictions for 2020 uh sorry beginning of 2021 for 300 radar predictions for 2021 so the three were one uh crypto art which i guess that came through like way sooner than i expected like literally just a month congratulations on that uh prediction markets uh which yeah they had poly market in particular had like a time i think they had like close to 30 million in volume like up until like the fight inauguration um and the third was uh d5 derivatives like that we're going to see more like complex structured products options like it's kind of the logical next step for dubai uh which you know that's still uh to be determined uh with all these new d5 projects that are launching that's uh this has been a fantastic interview guys and and i've really enjoyed being able to parse parts apart narrative versus data i think it's this conversation is i think something that the crypto world is really pioneering because i think when you really go down to the bottom level of it you actually can take this all the way back to legacy financial markets and just all markets ever are always one part data and one part narrative and i really see you guys as part pioneers of dancing this dance inside of this new this new paradigm that is crypto so thank you for coming on the show and sharing us you know what you guys have found out thanks for having us guys a lot of fun we love what you guys are doing so keep up the great work well thanks nick we try to keep it authentic on bankless and that's one word i hope you take away from this conversation investing in authentic things whether that's authentic fundamentals or authentic narratives that was certainly my takeaway some action items for you we've got some hot analytics on defy nfts and dune analytics we'll include resources uh for those in the show notes you could start looking at these protocols like richard chen does uh also we've included his three underrated predictions article in the show notes that was just referenced near the end third thing david it's a bull market we need some bull market five star reviews on itunes how are we doing with that always want to do better i we are just under 200 five star reviews and so in if enough listeners of this podcast give us those five star reviews we might break over 200 and that helps us get bankless to the tops of the itunes uh investing in business charts which is where we think bankless belongs there's a lot of good information coming out of this podcast at least i think and if you guys think that more people should hear that please give us those five star reviews wherever you listen to podcasts and if you are watching on youtube make
