[Music] welcome to layer 0. layer 0 is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community ethereum is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the ethereum community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm speaking with justin drake justin as we all know is the founder of the ultra sound money meme and we go through the creation process of the meme itself as well as how justin drake has moved across the different stacks the different layers of ethereum first as an entrepreneur than as an l1 dev and now what he what i call actually a l0 engineer uh a memer if you will um he is tinkering with the layer zero of ethereum by committing himself to the ultra sound money meme and so we start this conversation off with what does it mean to work for a meme this is what justin drake considers his current role in ethereum he's working for the ultrasound money meme and not only that but he's recruiting other people to also work for this meme which is just like kind of breaks the brain uh to anyone who doesn't really understand the role of memes and money and markets and finance but justin drake definitely understands that we also just kind of overall have an ethereum technical conversation it turns a little bit more into a more traditional bankless podcast where we talk about you know a little bit more of the code than what i advertise on layer zero but all of that context for um you know further innovations on ethereum staggering shards putting oracles at the base layer all this stuff it actually turns into towards the end of the conversation a conversation about justin drake the personality himself his sort of rebellious nature his lack of a nation-state identity and also how that is reflected in his kid as well and how those values are also instantiated in ethereum and himself uh and so the first two thirds of this podcast is all about ultrasound money uh and in ethereum the protocol a little bit tech focused but then it turns into the actual personality disposition of the man himself as well as his kid and kind of the story of his life and how it relates to ethereum so i really enjoyed this conversation with justin drake i really enjoyed seeing the man behind the meme and i'm pretty sure you will as well so without further ado let's go ahead and get right into the conversation with justin drake but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless balancer is a powerful platform for flexible automated market makers typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d5 with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indices but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to pre-determined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at banklist we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts too much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield in defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using balancers asset managers balancers of vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms balancers mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at app.balancer.fi all right bankless nation welcome to the third episode of layer zero here we're bringing on justin drake you guys all know him as the ultrasound money man and i feel like i think that's the right place to start off this conversation uh justin a fun little story for you um after we recorded our ultrasound money podcast with you me and ryan um i turned to ryan as like this is about to change the game like forever and every single week on the bankless newsletter we have like the market monday uh piece which is like a short little blurb to that usually i write write it but sometimes ryan writes it some right time somebody else writes it but usually i write it and in the uh piece i it was the uh the week before we were going to drop the ultrasound money uh podcast that we've recorded with you uh and in and so i usually write it and then ryan comes in and edits it and changes things up a little bit and in the in the market monday piece i had written uh the ethereum ecosystem the ethereum narrative will forever change as a result of this podcast and i use some like really like big language and ryan like asked me he he dm'd me i was like are you sure you want to make some like this grand of a statement in this grandiosity statement and i was like absolutely absolutely i do uh and uh he did he did walk me back a little bit but it turns out that that was exactly right like ethereum as an ecosystem has fundamentally changed ever since the ultrasound money meme really like took storm and it was it was a you know it was a collaborative effort between many people but it was really you so how does that feel how does it feel to be like the ultrasound money guy that like changed the trajectory of his of ethereum well i guess you know i i still think that we're at the very beginnings of the ultrasound money meme i would agree with you that it has kind of rallied the ethereum community specifically but it hasn't grown yet that much beyond the borders of the ethereum community um i mean there was you know some brief mentions on on bloomberg and on cnbc and whatnot uh but you know i believe the meme will educate a hundred million people and so we're at the very very beginnings uh of of that um i mean how i feel personally i mean the meme has kind of infected me it's kind of taken over my life and then in a way you know like in the same way that a virus takes over its host you can think of memes as you know the equivalent of genes that take over their host and i i've been taken over by this meme and i'm kind of spreading it to other people and other people are themselves putting it together um i mean are you like patient zero of this meme is that is that what your role is patient zero of ultrasound money yeah i i think so but you know maybe i'm patient one in the sense that uh vitalik had a very very similar meme before he invented me he his meme was uh supersonic money um and that you know that was good but it didn't really catch on in the same way i think partly because you know it doesn't reuse the word sound verbatim as we have with the bitcoiners with sound money um so yeah this is kind of interesting you know like just like genes mutate memes mutate as well and you can have um a totally kind of um non-viral meme with lots of potential that just needs this one little mutation and that changes the game i mean it's a little bit like monkeys and humans right where like 99 99.9 percent the same genetic material it's just these these few tiny tweaks that make a lot of difference um the supersonic money meme came around before ultrasound money and you're saying it it actually mutated into the ultrasound money meme but you you were the mutator right yeah that's correct basically you know we were chatting in a telegram group and uh you know vitalik was uh was was mentioning this meme i was like oh well it's a good meme but it didn't really catch on and then vitalik was like hmm maybe we should try harder you know to to to to bring it out to the community and then like a few minutes later i was like ah i i've got a better version of the meme um and um you know from that point onwards a lot of my time has been that just spent you know trying to make this meme a reality i guess um and you know i have a very obsessive um kind of a personality kind of addictive personality like when i do something i want to do it like right um and really go deep um and you know it's very different from what i was doing previously you know like i you know when i joined the film foundation i was doing um you know crypto economic research and then kind of i i went deep into cryptography and you know i've done all sorts of other things but now you know i'm i'm kind of doing something totally different kind of going down the stack from layer one to layer two as a two layer zero and actually i'd say more and more of my work is at layer zero interestingly so for example one of the things that i've been uh doing is recruiting right that's something that that just needs to be done a different foundation and and for some reason um you know i i've been one of the the you know the biggest recruiters uh of the of the uh the research team at dfrm foundation um and yeah so recruiting i guess you can think of the the ultrasound money meme as kind of being the decentralized version of of marketing um and you know these two things kind of hr and and recruiting and marketing were things i kind of despised and i i didn't really see myself doing these kind of roles but um you know in a decentralized context like they're kind of different and uh you know actually very interesting to to to dive into these these new fields yeah the the world of marketing historically has always felt like top downs like here's our brand here's our image let's like shove it down your throat but like in the world of of crypto marketing it's very much of just like an infinite amount of just like a b test a b c d e f g tests to like figure out which one works and it only ever works if like the world adopts it themselves rather than have it just like shove down it's their throat by like trillions of dollars of ba of ad spend exactly yeah there's these algorithms called genetic algorithms where basically you just try tons of mutations and then something sticks and then it just conquers the world um and it feels like you know the dfm community had a lot of of previous failed attempts you know that kind of laid the ground you know the the ground was very very fertile in the sense that the fm community was trying to find itself and it desperately wanted kind of this this meme and once it found it they kind of embraced it um and i i think that's partly why it grew it grew so fast but you know again i think it's it's it's still a baby meme it it it has to grow a bit more so um from my perspective you're like a genius cryptographer your big brains like can code all the things talk about all the crazy like cutting-edge technology that this industry has to offer that gets like way outside of like whatever i can even like comprehend yet you are like you said going from that from layer one down to like layer zero why do you think that you are most suited there rather than back up at the like cryptography level i mean i kind of have a bit of a founder kind of entrepreneurial mindset kind of building i just like building stuff and actually before i joined different foundation i was i was an entrepreneur and i um of a company and you get to do everything you know as a as a founder um and i i'm kind of this just jackable trader in that sense um and you know i think part of the the reason why i like doing different things is because i'm i guess i'm quite curious and i want to try and understand the the full stack you know when you when you look at uh computers for example you know it turns out there's like there's like 20 stacks right if you go you know all the way down to the transistor or to the silicon you know all the way up to you know the website there's just so many stacks in between and um oftentimes people will focus kind of on uh on maybe three four five stacks layers of the stack but you know i i want to i'd much rather try and get a full understanding of all 20 stacks and i guess you know this is part of just my my personal journey in the film ecosystem to try and understand every every single layer of the stack interesting yeah and every single layer of the stack has like it's its own rabbit hole right with his own rabbit holes upon rabbit holes um but like we say like everything kind of always leads back to layer zero so i kind of i think that makes sense that like that's actually where you found yourself yeah and actually if you think of me as an entrepreneur i was kind of at layer two right so i was i was trying to make open bazaar which is this uh decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace built on top of blockchain such as bitcoin and then i went to layer one and now now layer zero and you know it's possible that you know once once we're we're done you know shipping ev2 and and and all the good stuff there then maybe i'll go full circle and go back to layer two and build something cool there and just maybe we'll go through the cycle like one more time possibly so you said you kind of like work for this meme now as in like it's kind of your full-time job illustrate that like how how what is it like to work for the ultrasound money mean yeah so you know we we have these two pieces of infrastructure like one is um the ultrasound up on your website and the other one is the ultrasound money uh twitter account and the basic idea here was to try and do things as decentralized as possible so you know try and and and get you know different team you know different uh people uh to contribute to to to join the meme and i think i i mentioned basically the the story here which is that um i think it was at the end of your the second ultrasound money bankless podcast i said you know i bought this domain ultrasound.money i'm looking for a team and like 10 people came in and one of the the crazy things is that i had to do zero filtering on these 10 people all 10 people were invited to contribute they were all very high quality and i think part of the reason they were all very high quality is because in order to get to the very end of the second uh podcast they had to go through four hours of content and so only like kind of the the most uh you know enthusiastic people made it to to the end um and and actually more and more people have have started to volunteer you know through the through the twitter accounts you know they say oh you know we love your movement we love what you're doing how can i help so you know at this point there's maybe 15 20 people um you know who volunteered to to contribute and um you know i think a lot of the work um that we do at different foundation is the nation you know very similar to to to what danny's you know really really good at and i'm you know i've tried to help coordinate this this team but also you know provide kind of the the initial impetus and and and i guess maybe inspiration to to to to get this this idea out of the gate with uh so what kind of talent has shown up at the gates like uh is it like dev talent or marketing talent like what's is there any sort of through line like talk about all the skill sets that has like come to the ultrasound money meme yeah so um there's quite a lot of dev um so you know back and then front end but we have also some non-dev so for example there's this um artist rodrigo um who who just makes awesome awesome art um and um actually i think one of his pieces was auctioned on the on the bankless dao um and you know this guy just just created you know this this this art totally for free and he had no expectation of financial returns and you know he didn't even really have fine you know expectations of you know building much of a name for himself he just he was just trying to contribute and and and do something interesting um you know at the end of the day it turned out pretty well for him because he sold you know so many copies of of of of his of his nft and then i guess you know we've also had in the non-technical uh field like um someone who i think wants to remain anonymous who um basically is this this meme lord um who you know is behind you know a bunch of memes uh behind the the the twitter account that's that's awesome so how do you have goals like what is the goal of this like emergent organization like what is the goal with ultrasound money like if it's a business and you're an entrepreneur like what are you what's on the horizon what are you trying to go towards right i mean i think the the kpi is like how many how many mines can we infect and you know this is largely kind of an educational thing it's like um how far can we spread the meme to educate as many people as possible and you know one of one of the the metrics that we track for example is you know what what we call kind of the ultrasound fam uh the fan wearing the the kind of the the bat signal which is the two emojis uh which uh you know you're you're the grandfather of which is very cool that's pretty cool i am honored to have that spot yeah and uh you know the fan has been growing you know incredibly you know we have uh you know 300 fam members i think right now and it just keeps on growing you know at a steady rate every single day um and actually if you want to compare it to to other ethereum memes it's it's pretty striking so for example there's this other kind of ethereum meme on twitter which is that you're going to use your ens address you know as your twitter name so for example vitalik.if and so one of the things we we did is that we we went ahead and scraped all of um of ethereum twitter so that's about three million accounts um including kind of like the the two million accounts that that battalion follows and we found about 6500 um ens uh well twitter accounts with an ens and so you know you have one of the most powerful memes i think in a in ethereum which is the ens which kind of grew to 6500 over over kind of four years and then this ultrasound money meme which kind of in just a matter of you know four five six months grew to to over half the size that that's fantastic yeah and and so just just for the listeners that uh are a little bit unfamiliar the ultrasound money fam is if you have the bat emoji followed by the speaker emoji does it also work in reverse if you were you also scraping for speaker emoji and then bat emoji or does the order matter so there's tons of creativity and there's lots of flexibility so it turns out there's like three different speaker emojis there's like one with three lines one with one line and one with zero line people also kind of um change the ordering people sometimes kind of put a comma in between kind of open brackets the vat and people kind of do all sorts of of crazy variations like um you know for example people will use the the dolphin and then the the the speaker because dolphins also produce emojis i mean i kind of like to keep the dolphins separate for the flipping um so maybe you know at the flipping we can uh you know we're gonna pivot we can all pivot for for a day or two or a week or two um and then you know people change the the actually i i have a you know um a regular expression here on my computer but basically like people will swap out the emojis and be quite creative and like people will put it in unexpected places so for example people will put the bat emoji in the location which is something that we didn't scrape and so now we need to go ahead and scrape that as well yeah yeah i didn't think i finished my my thought but uh what justin is talking about is the ultrasound fam is those that have the bat and then the speaker emoji in their like twitter header their twitter name right and so if you are a part of like the ens clan you have like your name.eth and then now generally it's followed by the ultrasound money like like bat signal which is the bat and then the speaker emoji usually with three lines uh and it's interesting to see on the ultrasound.money page you have all of the top uh followed accounts that are a twitter accounts that are followed by people who have the ultrasound money meme in their twitter account and so like it's funny to see like anthony cesano actually recently flipped ryan sean adams as the number one person with the most ultrasound money fam followers but i will have to say i have the met of that i have the highest ratio of followers to ultrasound follower fam on there as well so i would like i would like people to know that but it's a fantastic way to make a fun little game about just like uh putting a personal identifier on your twitter profile which is like kind of what that that twitter biospace is for yeah i mean one of the you know one of the things that we've had is sometimes we've had kind of uh spam attacks so like people like very low quality accounts like accounts that participate for example in a lot of giveaways um add the bad emoji and so we we tried to to filter those off and like one of the the simplest and most powerful kind of quality metrics that we found is basically how many fam mem fam members does this account have that that follow them so we call them fan followers how many fan followers do you have um and you know as you can see on ultrasound.money and you scroll down to to the fam like you can clearly see that this these when you start ranking the the fan members by this like the really the high quality accounts stand out um and and this is true not just for the top five members but kind of for for the whole thing um we got we all know like so what what is the purpose of the ultrasound money meme like why is that so such an important thing to like dedicate your time to right um so i i think part of the part of the reason is basically the realization that um if ethereum is not pure technology right there's if you want if you want utility if you want things like like security if you want economic bandwidth then the the monetary aspect plays a key role and this is something that i think the devs myself included very heavily under under appreciate um and so um you know what we're basically what i'm what the meme is trying to do basically is educate people on the monetary aspects of ethereum and now why is this important the reason it's important is because money is is a meme right it's you you need in order to achieve this this monetary premium this this magic meme energy um you somehow need to have you know coordination across the across the community and um memes which are basically just ideas that replicate are ideal for coordination because basically they all program us to think in the same way and so we're in a position where everyone knows that everyone else thinks the same way and so we can all kind of be on the same wavelength and be coordinated around making if a monetary kind of shelling point um and then as i said once you have this this monetary selling point and you you achieve high monetary premium you're in you're in a position where you can provide a huge amount of utility and one of the reason is because you can have very very high economic security it basically will be you know impossible even for nation state to attack ethereum and so you know some of the kind of code is law and immutability and kind of all these nice properties and liveness and safety have have more credibility behind them but also because if is used as you know a collateral money um the the fact that the money appreciates unlocks uh economic bandwidth and so you know if you look at uh for example make a dow you know it's actually in a way disappointingly small you know it's only quote only six billion die um that are that are out there you know especially when you compare it to to a system like usdt which has 10 times the amount you know 60 billion and you know one of the the key limitations is that we need this trustless collateral and we need you know a hundred more times a thousand more times more collateral um and the only way to get you know a thousand more times more collateral is for the the token to to gain this this monetary premium so uh here's here's a question that i don't i don't think has been asked before um do you think the existence of the ultrasound money meme will has or will impact the genie coefficient of ether um that's a hard question to just like come out of left field with you at okay so so while you think i'll kind of explain the genie coefficient to users uh the genie coefficient is just a measure of like the distribution of ether or or any currency or any unit ever right and so if you have a strong genie coefficient i can't remember if the number is high or low it's a measure of how concentrated ownership over a certain supply of things are one of the best things about the ethereum ico regardless of what bitcoiners will say about it is that the ico actually allowed the genie coefficient of ether to be pretty strong for a an asset that you know was just birthed usually assets that are birthed have a terrible genie coefficient because they're in the hands of a few but the ico is a mechanism to distribute ether into the hands of many many people which is really really important if we talk about the properties of money it's good to have money distributed because as we all know like it's easier to get people on board on a particular money if more people have it um do you think so yeah so back back to the question do you think like this ultrasound money meme has impacted the future current or state of or the future state of the genie coefficient of ether yeah it's a good question i mean i think to to a large extent um kind of early adopters don't need much more conviction you know they already have extremely high conviction and um i think the the meme maybe it kind of crystallizes expresses kind of an intuitive feeling that they had and kind of confirms and so in in that sense hopefully you know it might not um make these these kind of early whales uh you know not want to sell uh and anymore that they they they previously did not want to sell um i mean one of the things that i'm that i'm hoping is that kind of the the meme and brings on you know many many more people and especially give them access for example to very fresh uh revenue sources which are which will which will lower the the the the genie coefficient and in particular you know um staking so you know with with staking we're in a position where uh we can really distribute eve to many many people um and and and you know one of the reason is because the the barrier to entry to staking is so low that anyone can participate um and the other reason is that the profit margins are very very high so basically when you combine these two anyone can come in and anyone can enjoy the fruit of of staking then basically this this this new issuance is kind of going to dilute dilute the the existing the existing holders and i guess another aspect of this dilution and redistribution is basically from those who use the network to the stakers and the reason is because part of the transaction fees will will not be burnt kind of the the mev portion and so that is another force towards circulation of of funds do you think that um the concept of proof of stake as it's applied to ethereum impacts the genie coefficient or is it kind of a wash and it just kind of doesn't actually impact it all that much tough questions huh right yeah no these are questions i'm just kind of thinking up on on the fly but i think they're they're they're interesting to ponder about okay so i mean because you know again for the same argument because because staking is is really open to all and because the the profit margin is so high then then we have this this this this natural kind of redistribution of things um yeah it's it's it's it's very very hard to tell basically um what percentage like the existing holders will be staking like one of the policies that we have at the dfm foundation is that we basically want to be staking roughly as a percentage roughly what is currently being staked so for example if there's 10 percent of a leaf that is staked um then the film foundation would like to stake about 10 percent and and and the the reason we we kind of have this this kind of unofficial policy is because it gives us kind of neutrality we're not we're not favored you know we're not biased in one way or another to what's taking um and so uh you know the the the question is you know are are these these large holders staking more or less than the average um and uh you know actually you know just just you know personally i'm i'm staking actually a little bit less uh than than the average so there you go what's the incent why aren't you taking all of your ether like why have you just aped all the way in um i i think part of the reason is that when you make the sausage you know how it's made and you know there's there's uh there's a bunch of of of tail risk you know that is that is that is difficult to to to quantify you know one one of the things that i've that i've been um doing at dpm foundation is trying to build us as quickly as as we as we can basically a dedicated security team to really harden uh the beacon chain so um i think we're gonna provide a little bit more you know transparency uh through blog posts and things like that but basically you know whenever you have new software um especially when you have you know four different clients and and quite a bit of complexity you know there's bound to be bugs and vulnerabilities and things like that and i think we're we're in a privileged position with with the with the beacon chain where as far as we can tell no attacker has really like no black hat attacker has tried to to break this so um you know we we have had you know uh quite you know significant number of of reports from from from white hats and we've been you know fixing and you know things are definitely getting much much better you know like the the frequency of reports is going down the severity of the bugs is going down it's more and more kind of edge cases that are hard to trigger and things like that um so yeah in in in general like you know security is you know one of our big goals and um where we're working as as fast as we can to get security to a high enough we can actually do the merge right it would be totally reckless to do the merge if we don't have high confidence in the beacon chain and this confidence is is increasing uh very rapidly so i've been asking a lot of questions about ether ultrasound money and ethereum and i actually want to kind of revisit the layer zero aspect of this podcast which is more about you you the individual but also keeping in theme with the ultrasound money meme you talked about how like the importance of the ultrasound money meme is a secure ethereum right the the value of ether implies the security of ethereum that is good for everyone that's building on top of ethereum therefore the role of somebody who's working on the ultrasound money meme it becomes really really important it's like if if you are focused on securing ethereum you might actually step away from the code and actually start to work on the memes which is kind of sounds like what you've done and i kind of think that that is a expansion or an extrapolation of kind of like the original cipher cypherpunk vision right cypherpunk's used to be all about math and code and cryptography except now the role of what a cypherpunk is with the emergence of cryptoeconomics has expanded into new realms it's like unlocked new territory that it comes into so i kind of think of you justin as like a leading new age cypherpunk how do you feel about that that label yeah i mean it's a very grandiose label and you know i'm not sure i'd put it on myself but yeah i'd agree that you know the the economic aspect has has unlocked kind of this this new design space and actually there's there's kind of these impossibility results there's certain things that you we just can't do with cryptography alone and so we need to make these concessions right like when we have this uh you know the protocol sync thesis cryptography and math are like one of the lowest layers you know they're super robust and then you know have like the more mushy layers which is the the economics but you know having the the the these two layers combined like the really hard layer and the the mushy one gives you like these these these super powers um and uh yeah this this is something that i've i've only you know i appreciated you know i guess relatively recently and uh and i mean i guess one of the reasons why why i'm i'm working at this layer is because there's there's a little bit of of taboo and resistance i guess from other technical people you know it's i feel like i'm in a unique position to be doing the work that i'm doing partly because no one else is really keen to do that that work you know it's kind of seen a little bit as dirty work um [Music] but i i kind of see it as as as very important we in the bankless world we often use like the pioneer as a metaphor it's like come on we're all going west like grab your favorite leader and and go west with them sounds like that you are tr specifically trying to be like the pioneer for the other like code and math and technical minded people specifically trying to like corral them and being like no guys like this is the way this is where we're going like let's let's all go westward yeah right um i mean it's not like i i kind of pioneered and completely invented this this idea that the memes are super important you know like it turns out that this goes back you know even to to gold right gold is just to very large extent just a meme and and bitcoin took it to to to an extreme you know like really emphasizing the the memes um and um you know i i i you know you know in the bitcoin land there was this kind of this debate should do small block big block and i think both sides have have very very good arguments you know on you know and and and i think the the the big mistake of bitcoin is is is thinking it's very um kind of black and white is is like either either one or the other but it turns out that it it's both right like we want the transactional utility and you know how do we get this transactional utility we get it with scalability with privacy um you know with uh programmability um with economic bandwidth and all and all these things um but you know in in addition to kind of the raw transactional utility you also want kind of the the the monetary premium uh and and all the memes um and and these things are actually symbiotic they reinforce each other um and the reason is that in in in order to achieve monetary premium you need to distinguish yourself in some way or another and like one way to distinguish yourself is basically to have like to maximize utility if you are like you know the the the substrate for the internet of value and you're settling you know the world economy then you know you become the natural shelling point to become uh the this this this money for for the internet and vice versa you know once you once you've achieved this monetary premium as i already mentioned that provides utility for the utility in the sense that it provides security and economic economic bandwidth hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation with justin drake so far coming up in the second half of the conversation we talk about both ether and ethereum's march towards capital efficiency and what that means for the holistic system if we always are going towards more and more efficiency we also talk about the quantum computing threat as it relates to both ethereum but also more importantly to towards bitcoin as the thing that can't really adapt or change or overcome obstacles um and then we also talk about what justin drake thinks about the current state of the layer zero of ethereum and also where he thinks it's going to develop into the long term and where he hopes it develops into the long term we also talk about layers 3 and layers 4 what those are and how they relate to the layer 1 and the layer 0. i thought that was a particularly interesting topic of conversation and there's a call to action to any graphic designers who are interested in in illustrating this concept in a in a actual design that we can actually like all look at uh so there's that uh and we also talk about justin drake's kid and also justin drake himself and his lack of identity with any one specific nation state or any one specific culture and how that is a result of how he grew up and how that relates to what he works on on ethereum he has a distaste for politics yet we all know that governance is a part of this thing so we parse apart those details we also talk about justin drake's non-laptop related hobbies and turns out he likes to tinker on the piano and even that has something to talk about as it relates to ethereum so i hope you guys are enjoying this conversation and the second half of the show in my opinion is even more fun than the first so let's go ahead and get right into it but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in d5 or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in eth so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on avi there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave.com after like having our first and second podcast with you the the first being moon math all about cryptography and the second being all about ultrasound money my mind has actually kind of become convinced that like the only viable crypto economic system is a smart contract enabled system which promotes utility and actually promotes like the reasoning for using the thing in the first place and then also proof of stake because it's also the you know the system that requires the least amount of operational costs to secure and so i feel like if we if we go and through and we're living in a simulation and we run through all the possible simulations we will end up at a smart contract proof-of-stake system every single time do you agree with that um so it turns out there's like some technical reasons as to why for example smart contracts are not necessarily fully required and the reason is because once you have the data availability layer and once the blockchain has one single functionality which is the ability to verify snarks you can do everything because you can do zk roll ups um but you know i guess that's just a a minor technical detail is that is that also the future of ethereum in your mind is that where we're going as an ecosystem i think it's definitely possible like um the reason is that um you know in the in the in the short and medium term we're taking this this this roll-up approach and i i believe that you know the long-term winners are going to be the the the the zk roll ups but um like one of the the the very very so one of the problems with with ethereum which is one of its greatest strengths but also one of its weaknesses is the evm the evm is has so many many quirks and it's it's arguably you know badly designed in many many different ways and you know each of these ways are not a deal breaker but there's like a laundry list of 200 issues with the evm and and they start to to add up um and so you know one of the things we've been um looking into is like is there a replacement for the for the evm and it turns out that once you have snogs you can basically um have arbitrary vms so and and this is something that we're starting to see like for example um stockwear came up with uh with with cairo and and kind of their own vm and then you know like there's the mata labs they have their own zk sync and then and and so in inferior at least you can take any vm for example wasm and then you can snorkify it and then you can not start running it uh on the evms simply by um by verifying the snarks and so this this has actually two advantages one is that you get the scalability of of zk rollups you know you just have to verify one single stock uh which is very very cheap but the other advantage is that you get to escape the evm right you have uh it's a it's kind of this this this wormhole right that allows you to go explore a different portal into a different vm right exactly so i think this is definitely a possible future one of the things that we're you know heavily considering is basically um if and when we have a vm which really stands out for example is really really snog friendly meaning that it has very very good performance in this narkification world and it has all sorts of other advantages maybe it's more death friendly like wasm or maybe is more friendly to for more verification or maybe is more friendly to optimistic approaches or whatever it is then we can take this this awesome vm and kind of enshrine it at layer one so that could give us you know various advantages like um you know a natural shelling point to avoid you know too much fracturing of the ecosystem um it could provide lower latency it could maybe provide better security guarantees it could provide maybe performance optimizations there's all sorts of things that get unlocked once you're happy to enshrine a vm but i think at this point in time we're very very happy with the situation we're in where we have the evm okay it's not perfect but you know it's it's the natural shelling point for all smart contracts in the you know way beyond uh ethereum and so there's this very powerful network effect dvm is good enough in the sense that it unlocks all these these parallel worlds that you can go explore through snorkified vms and then maybe in the more distant future we can enshrine a really awesome vm maybe have you know one instance running per shot or something like that so i i know that there's a small ideological debate going on between i think you vitalik and a few other core ethereum contributors about like the long-term expressivity of ethereum uh i remember you once upon a time uh submitted an eip to instantiate the eth price at the protocol level uh and then also uh in our episode our first cryptography moon math episode you talked about like staggering all of the shards so that there's one shard uh making it uh finalizing every like one second so you actually get really quick finality over time and so like you seem to be looking towards ethereum with kind of like a high touch approach let's let's just turn this like machine that we have into the most like decently complicated well oiled like fantastically like capable machine where others i think vitalik is more in the camp of just like let's just let's just make it what we need and then stop touching it um do you see this as a future uh issue that that some of the core ethereum contributors are going to have to like get into a table and like discuss about what they want to do or or where does this story go yeah so just a couple of things like one is that uh you know the the stackeric is something that this this consensus on i've you know okay i didn't know that yeah there's something it's we're likely going to go ahead with um i mean actually there's there's i think much more alignment than than then you kind of portrayed it there okay i think i think everyone wants maximum simplicity and basically just build what's enough and so i think everyone falls into the vitalik kind of camp and philosophy i think the real debate is you know what do we really need um and like one of my one of my heuristics i guess is that if if you can't do it at layer one we should very very seriously consider doing it at if you can't do that layer two very seriously consider it doing it at layer one and trustless oracles is it turns out to be one of those things like as far as i know there's this is no really like fully trustless way of of doing oracles at layer 2. like the best that we have is chain link and you know while chain link might be kind of good enough you know in the short and medium term is it really kind of the long-term technical solution that we want you know to to power you know stable coins like you know liquidity and and and stuff like that i mean i i think the answer is maybe it's good enough but it's not a convincing answer and um and so you know on on the other hand we you know we don't want uh to enshrine all our calls on the one it doesn't make any any sense and so really what you want to be doing is you you want to look at this kind of this long tail and you want to you want a solution with like kind of one percent of the complexity that gains you 80 percent of the value and i think if we were to enshrine one single oracle it would probably be kind of the if usd uh price and it turns out that you can kind of leverage the the the the the basic security assumptions that we're making at layer one to get an oracle with very very similar security assumptions and so if you're using ethereum you don't have to pay more in terms of security assumptions if you want to use this oracle whereas if you're using chain link now suddenly you have two assumptions one is you you you you're paying the the the platform of ethereum but you're also paying the platform risk of of of chain link um how would the us dollar price of ether actually become uh instantiated in the protocol how what's the technical process behind that right so you know one way to do it for example is with committees so we have this for example this honesty assumption in the theorem where we assume that you know half the stake is honest and what we do is that we sample committees which are large enough to be static statistically representative wider population and then these committees of so-called attesters um are going to go vote on on various things and we basically assume that if the majority of of the committee members vote on something then that's reflexive of of of of the wider population and it's kind of true um and so we could have these committees basically vote on what they think is the price of of u.s dollar i mean the the big problem here is that basically the the the price of of ethan in u.s dollars is subjective and and and kind of one of our design goals is to be kind of world war three resistant right and there's kind of some of these edge cases where like the there is legitimately uh a definitional question as to what the usd is so for example in argentina there's kind of um there's the kind of two market rates for the argentinian peso there's kind of i forget what it's called but like blue market and black market or whatever um and so if you're if you're in a situation where you know the the u.s economy goes crumbling there could be a lot of chaos and we don't want this kind of chaos around the us dollar to be a systemic risk for for ethereum right um there's also the topic of just like the us dollar is an arbitrary anchor in of itself right like the choice to include the dollar is also subjective in the first place so i think maybe maybe the big debate behind this thing is like do we even include subjectivity into the layer one at all right exactly um like the the the simple approach the purest approach is to say just no subjectivity whatsoever um but uh yeah i mean like i mean if you if you look at uh at a deterministic virtual machine it it's it's extremely powerful right it's too incomplex to incomplete you know it has everything but actually it doesn't have all the superpowers that you want and more specifically it doesn't have the oracles now there's various types of oracles that are very very familiar to your computer like if you if you take a phone for example it's aware of things like what is the time it's it's also able to gather randomness it's also able to you know gather pick up the temperature or whatever now in the context of you know decentralized finance for example and and the internet of value knowing what the time is is very important um having access to randomness is very important and the blockchain being aware of its own price i would argue is also very important i mean we we are definitely improving in terms of these oracle so for example eip1559 gives us an oracle more specifically it gives us a base fee oracle so basically the blocked dvm is aware of itself as to how valuable as block space is and i think we need to yeah in either terms exactly and so the more we have like these really you know important oracles i think the more complete the the evm will be interesting that's a fantastic are there any other like parts of like the ethereum future road map that is are kind of like up for debate as it comes to like high touch versus low touch styles right um i mean i i think one one thing that we have uh kind of consensus on is that we need to do a quantum upgrade this is non-negotiable i mean some some people will say oh and i mean this is a diminishing population but some some people will say quantum computers will never arrive they're kind of skeptics and our position is that even in that scenario which is not the consensus within kind of quantum physicists that we still need protection against quantum computers and the reason is because that blockchains are meant to be these ultra-conservative pieces of infrastructure and you know we need at least kind of 10 years of heads up in order to do all the upgrades because these things are very very slow to upgrade especially if you know in let's say five ten years you know ethereum has a ten trillion dollar market cap it is going to be especially difficult to to change it and so this is one of the actually high touch kind of things that we what that we need to do like taking out the guts um the cryptographic guts and changing them for for um post quantum cryptography could could have quite quite big consequences in terms of where there's still kind of um debate i mean one of the the big ones which we we talked about is basically do we want to enshrine a vm um other than the evm um and i'm i'm leaning towards yes and part of the reason why i'm leaning towards yes is that um you know the the power of innovation is is is so huge and we've only just scratched the surface in terms of vms that are custom designed for blockchains um and you know we've also just scratched the surface in terms of vm's custom design for stockification and and and for more verification and things like that and so i'm i'm optimistic that uh you know in in in five ten years time the evm will look completely outdated and it will kind of be kind of it will kind of be stupidly obvious there'll be this natural shelling point that yes this is this is like 10 100 times better and we should just all adopt adopt this new thing and enshrining it at layer one will will help achieve this this this shutting point um i mean another thing that you you brought up is you know this this this idea of a parallel universe where um you know proof of stake is a necessity because it's the most economically efficient eip159 is a necessity because it's the most economically efficient um and it turns it's definitely possible that we'll find ways to be even more economically efficient than we are today and like um one um one possible way to do that would be to find a way to to burn the the mev now it this is kind of an alpha leak i don't know when you when you're podcasting three weeks three weeks okay so in three weeks it will definitely be published so basically we have this uh this kind of mev intern um which we hired kind of uh um three months ago and it's quite possible that he actually cracked mev which is a huge that's a massive statement cracking i mean yeah yeah yeah that's like stuff that dreams are made of oh yeah um kind of totally out of left field he came up with this super simple kind of genius idea to basically do what's called mev smoothing so like the big the big problem of muv is that it's highly volatile and spiky and this spikiness um basically um is a liability for the security of the consensus layer and so if you can smooth out the mev suddenly it starts becoming very similar to issuance right this grade a fuel which you can you can rely upon and it's kind of injected at a constant um rate and so basically his idea is when you produce a block like all the mev shouldn't go to the block producer it should actually go all the validators that help get this block on chain namely the block proposer and all the committee members that are voting to include that to basically attest in a position where actually the mev is spread out it's kind of smooth over the the the whole committee um and so um you know that actually turns mev from a liability into an asset right um from a security standpoint um so it just turns into staking yields right yeah it turns in into something very very similar to issuance um so so it mev today is already staking yields but it's like highly volatile yields um and and this volatility basically incentivizes uh re-orgs and forking and and and very you know kind of nasty things once you're in a position where you you smooth things out then it's it's kind of the really the the position you want to be in to to maximize uh security and this so another consequence of of this idea is that potentially we could burn the mev so we'd be in a position where the protocol kind of has some knowledge you know very similar to this oracle idea right the not only is the evm aware of the base fees but it's also aware of how much muv there is because it's capturing it and spreading it to the whole committees and so we're potentially in a position where we can burn the mev and so we could take kind of the the ultra soundness as they were to the next level where um you know right now like the the the data suggests that the the fee burn is about 70 so of all the fees we're burning 70 percent well maybe we can burn this extra you know 30 as well so we can approach 100 of the burn rate of transaction fees yeah potentially um i mean i don't want to oversell this right now because it's still kind of uh early research but uh yeah i i at least the the aspect of um turning mev from a liability to an asset um seems very very promising and there'll be an uh if research post coming soon and this this kind of speaks to like the the dao nature of ethereum the word daos are are kind of misused when we talk about them nowadays like bankless dow uniswap dao not a doubt just a digital organization the only two doubts that i think are truly functioning at this point in time are bitcoin and ethereum those are the dows as in they are decentralized and they're autonomous and there's some emergent bottom-up organization and like the the direction of the ethereum dao tends to always go towards efficiency right and so if you're telling me that we like we're working towards efficiency and security and this is just another innovation that we've been able to unlock that lends towards that idea and we all know that like defy is on an in a relentless march towards capital efficiency of the assets that finds that find themselves inside of defy and so like and so like going back to that like if we run the simulation over and over and over again the bloc crypto economic system that makes it that you discover whatever we call it ethereum or whatever name we want to to name this in these different universes the number one thing that you will find inside of every simulator every trial of the simulation is that each economic system gravitates towards efficient maximum efficiency every single step of the way yeah absolutely i mean another way to rephrase that is just trying to absorb innovation as much as possible and i think one of the the killer features um of ethereum is uh you know kind of touring completeness is this this awesome innovation sponge right and the reason is that you can you can build any program you want on the evm um but yeah like uh the the the other aspects of this innovation sponge are you know the the throughput from a data standpoint you know we're improving that greatly with um with uh shouting um there's also the the economic security aspect which we've talked at lengths and we're improving and then there's also the monetary aspect which we've taught that lands and it turns out that you know in in in each of these these four kind of uh that directions we're just making incremental progress um and we're we're very very open to to absorbing absorbing the innovation um and i think that's that's partly kind of uh i think one of your previous questions was where for example is that disagreement within the ef and i think that there is some disagreement is as to when you know if theorem will be considered kind of done like my my kind of gut feel is that we've only had 13 years of blockchain innovation and there's there's at least another 20 years of very very fruitful kind of exponential kind of innovation and that um you know most likely theorem won't be kind of you know totally done uh you know anytime anytime soon um and you know like the the the quantum threat aspect one of the good things about it is that it it's widely accepted and so even the bitcoin is kind of accepted you know kind of the ossification maximalist will will accept it um and so it's it's i think that might be kind of one of the last times where we do it so if we assume for example the quantum computers will arrive in 30 years or let's say 25 years then in in let's say in 15 years um this will be kind of our last chance to get all the good gadgets that we want and thanks to this this kind of forced massive revamping of the system because of quantum computers an external ice age if you will um right exactly you said that even bitcoiners tend to accept the quantum threat um nick have you heard of nick carter's foot dice oh yes yes yes i i love his fat dice yes but he has quantum quantum computing on the foot dice yes absolutely why are they on the fed dice if you say that bitcoiners are generally uh accepting of the quantum threat yeah okay interesting um i think the the reason why it's on the fat dice is because nick carter is myopic and the reason that he's myopic is that he only thinks kind of 10 20 years into the future like you know another kind of similar issue is the the low issuance like okay low insurance is not really a big deal you know we'll just kick the can and we'll think about it in in 20 to 30 years um and you know i think that that that attitude is actually okay if you're happy to embrace innovation because basically you're saying if there is some massive innovation in the next 20 years which is very very likely because we live in this exponential innovation world and then we can just go grab the fruits and and do the upgrade but you know you can't have this this this relaxed attitude if you say that you know whatever was created on day one is what we're gonna have for the rest of time um i mean when i say that quantum is accepted it's like i i don't think the the stance of the bitcoin technical community is that quantum computers will never come hence it's not a threat i think they they do acknowledge that they will come but the reason why they consider it fudd is because it's you know it's it's it's so far in the distance and and in that sense they're a little myopic interesting to me if you put quantum computing on the flood dice and you think that bitcoin can overcome that via technological changes like you're committing to a hard fork do would you agree with that assumption yeah i mean you can do all sorts of crazy gymnastics with soft forks you know if that's the technical distinction that you're you're putting forward um so you know soft forks and heart folks are not too dissimilar and from a capability standpoint but yes like some sort of massive fork that radically changes bitcoin yes and not just from a technical standpoint it's it's also fundamentally a social thing why is it a social thing the reason is that there's lost coins and we need to decide what to do with these lost coins like part of the the bitcoin ethos is we're not going to do any kind of rescue and actually this is very very similar to the dow right the problem with the dow was that you had one single entity the dao attacker which had control over let's say i forget what it is exactly but let's say ten percent of the supply like a huge amount of the eave supply and here it's basically it would be a similar situation a quantum attacker which could be a single entity or maybe a small handful entities could have control over 10 percent of of the bitcoin supply this 10 being all the lost bitcoins um and it's interesting because you know if the bitcoiners are going to be kind of intellectually consistent with the the past observations they they would reject the idea of of um you know of of confiscating these coins and just destroying them they'd say oh no code is law and you know the the the bitcoin script was was was cracked and you know we just need to run the the scripts as as they're programmed and 10 of the supply is going to go to this quantum attacker but of course you know this is just impractical especially if you want to be like uh you know money for for the world economy is if you're going to have a 10 you know 100 trillion dollars of monetary energy stored in the bitcoin network it is kind of inconceivable for a single entity to have 10 trillion dollars you know kind of the half the size of the m3 supply of of of the us dollar or something that doesn't make sense interestingly that it would it would go all those 10 of the bitcoins would go to a an into a single entity that would have the maximum amount of like like hashing power which is kind of like equivalent to a proof of work right but instead of going through the actual proof of work route you're just you're just running proof of work through private keys right just now you're just doing it with quantum computers which is interesting to think about how like the other way to get a bunch of bitcoins is to like maximize your computational compower but now it's just in a in a quantum uh field um i mean yeah you're right it's kind of stretching the analogy but yeah it's an interesting point but yeah it's no it's a route it's roundabout proof of work unintentional proof of work yeah not intended proof of work but if you take your comment literally there's actually this is a very deep observation which is that proof of work is broken under quantum computers if you have sufficiently advanced quantum computers then then then proof of work is is is essentially broken and so you know one of the the kind of the the long-term kind of i i ideas of of how bitcoin is secured is basically you have these these asics most law is broken so that you know you it's basically equivalent to to to to proof of stake where you know you have a you know fairly you know homogeneous distribution of of these asics um and uh it turns out that th this vision is going to get potentially disrupted by quantum computers in the sense that all the asics will become worthless from one day to another and you have to go through the same growth phase and maturation phase that that we've gone through so in in the traditional silicon in the world there's been four kind of maturation phase for proof of work we got one from cpus to gpus to fpgas and then a6 and then kind of the the end of moore's law kind of asics i guess five phases and then as soon as you you change the paradigm you know you in this quantum paradigm then suddenly you're you you go back to to to almost the genesis from a security standpoint where you know proof of work is is just like satoshi was the only miner at the very beginning at the very beginning of this quantum era there's going to be a single minor and yes there is going to be the difficulty adjustment and things like that but your decentralization is basically going to go down to zero yeah it's just gonna be gonna be a complete reset of the entire proof-of-work system right because you can start from like day one again yeah exactly yes and bitcoin as well say this is five do you know because maybe you know one of the observations is that you you need quantum computers which uh you know i potentially much more advanced than the ones that can break the private key so you know it's maybe an extra 10 10 or 20 years after the um after these these first generation quantum computers but you know it's still very much a possibility that they will come and reset the proof of work i want to pivot the conversation to back to layer zero so you you used to be a layer one engineer and now i kind of view you as like a layer zero engineer so with thinking into the long term about the layer zero of ethereum of this community that we're all part of do you have any like long term projections or wishes for the layer zero of ethereum what do you want it to turn into um interesting um i mean you know i really like the layers here of today i think the film you know uh community and culture is just just so so so great and i think there is a risk of of dilution right as soon as you you grow then then you might dilute but there's potentially a way out which is basically um abstraction like if we're in a position where many many you know billions of people can use a film without even knowing that they're using ethereum then they'd be in they'd effectively be at layer two but they're not at least zero you know how i said that you know we're going full circle basically between layers zero and layer two because it's kind of people on both sides but actually these are different people like you can be part of the community and not a user and vice versa you can be a user and not part of the community so i think the ideal scenario is basically where the the layer zero grows very significantly but the quality stays very high and i think there is actually a a possibility to to do that and basically the the kind of the filter is kind of geekiness or kind of intellectual curiosity like it's it's very difficult to get into ethereum if you're not very multi-disciplinary and intellectually curious um and so you kind of the in a way the the barrier to entry is maybe relatively high and that could be kind of a filter and then everyone else who just wants to use ethereum for its utilitarian values can just use it without understanding and so i guess it's very similar to planes like everyone uses planes but i guess the plane community like the ultra geeks who knows how you know every single button in the cockpit and you know how the engines are made in the in in the jets and and things like that that's probably a very special community which is relatively small and uh and yeah and kind of pure in that sense it seems to be that with that perspective like the whole purpose of ethereum is to like let a thousand layer zeros be born on top of layer two right so like infinity layer threes if you will just infinity communities built on top of layer twos which are built on top of layer ones which were built on top of the ethereum community which is like the layer zero i see what you mean okay so tons of communities built on top of layer two yeah that that makes a lot of sense each one with its own sets of values and principles which they are allowed to choose from because ethereum allowed them to choose from the full set of all values and principles because that's the value and principles of the layer zero yes i like that i mean maybe maybe we could call it layer four and the reason is because um in my mental model kind of layer three is the service layer right so you need all this middleware between kind of the the smart contract and the user um that was just kind of layer layer three and so for example coinbase is layer three right there they're kind of connected to the blockchain they make deposits and withdrawals and also things but they provide this this service and then i guess layer four would be the the the the communities that are built on top of that whoever if there's anyone listening who wants to turn this into a graphic especially if you're in the bank list out i'll i'll tip 5000 bank to whoever's in the bankless dow who wants to turn this into a graphics so we can deliberate about this on twitter justin i want to go into a little bit more detail about about what what you get up to uh i'm sure like many people in the ethereum world you're more or less a workaholic and so you're probably in front of your computer like i don't know anywhere between six and 18 hours a day but when you cut close the lid of your laptop like what happens next in your life like what do you go do so that is correct i am a workaholic um which is which is you know is great in the sense that i love what i do but it definitely have has downsides um you know in terms of of of health for example and just uh just friendships outside of work and and and things like that but um you know i i do have a family so i i'm i've been married for six years and i have a i have a young kid and you know i guess a lot of my my time is just being a parent you know just spending time with my kid dropping him to school and teaching him you know stuff like like today for example we were we were flying a quadcopter um you know i'm at my my parents's house um and like kind of teaching him you know what goes into a quadcopter for example the fact that uh the specific quadcopter that we have has a has a has a gps uh and it uses gps so that if there's a bit of wind it doesn't it doesn't drift away it kind of stays where it is and so i explained to him that basically there's these you know satellites that every second produce a pulse and then all these different you know satellites are slightly uh the pulses come at slightly different times and then the gps chip will kind of analyze when the process are received and then using that it can determine its position and and so you know i guess it's just uh these distilling a lot of the the the complicated technology that i've enjoyed learning kind of on my own and passing it on to to to to my son is he a technically inclined individual does he like all the i mean all boys to some degree love gadgets what part of like uh justin drake the cipher punk do you see in this kid how old is he um he's six six okay um so yeah he's he you know i mean maybe every parent will say that but he's he's pretty he's pretty sharp um and um he's he's capable to appreciate many different things um like at one point he was uh he was really into mathematics and i think partly because of mimetic desire you know like i you know someone told him that i studied mathematics and then he wanted to do some mathematics and then like but now it looks like it seems like he he he's he's moving on like no now he's really into art and and and crafty things and and stuff like that um he's also very much into languages so my family is kind of uh extremely international so like i i i to kind of illustrate this i say to people that i was born in the uk from a british dad and an argentinian mother um and then we we lived in china and um i'm also italian uh by by blood um and uh you know my wife is russian and she she speaks japanese which is what she studied at university and so he he's kind of inherited this this this international aspect um you know through learning all sorts of different languages um so he has one for example grandmother who's who speaks to him in front in french and then another grandmother he speaks to him in russian and then i speak to him in in in in english and and and stuff like that with and he really appreciates the i guess the you know being read you know books in different languages and uh yeah that is hilariously appropriate for somebody who's like working on the layer zero of ethereum to have like a such a diverse background of culture that like you don't actually have one specific culture that is like the most resonant thing with ethereum that i can actually think of yeah and i've kind of almost lost this nation-state identity in the sense that i don't even speak a single language without an accent so i it's so awesome so i i lived uh roughly half my life in france you know from 1 years old to 14 years old and when i was 14 i guess i would consider myself kind of french um but you know and then i i went to live in china and then i i came back to the uk and i studied there and and i've i've spent you know 14 years now in the uk and uh you know i i can't really say that i feel like i'm a true brit or or true frenchy i'm just a citizen of the world i guess and and this is even more true where you know i i adhere to i guess the the bankless nation right this is my nationality um and then and i also try to you know detach myself you know from the nation state i actually you know i feel it's a very early idea but the the idea of network stage from balagi is just so mind-blowing and this is this is something some sort of a meme i want to contribute towards right maybe in in 20 or 30 years i could see myself um trying to build a network state with all the infrastructure that we're building today yeah well i think with this massive like regulation conversation that has arisen lately like it's only going to accelerate the desire for people to um have the options to opt out of their like nation state identities like i would never i don't really consider myself like a patriot i don't fly the united states flag and i think a lot of younger generations uh resonate with that inside the united states where like being a proud supporter of america is like no longer cool for a large part of the population and we're kind of looking towards online identities to like find to fill that niche right to fill that void right um i mean i personally really dislike politics and i try to minimize it in my life um and you know i think governance is is a fundamental part of layer 0 but what i what i like about blockchains is this government governance minimization right so you know it it could be argued that governance has you know in the lifetime of ethereum only really kind of stuck its neck out you know in in a big way once which was for the dow um you know let's hope that this these kind of events don't happen very often and ideally just just this just this one time and really try to to to to minimize the decisions that the humans have to make and maximize the the just the autonomous programmable you know inspectable whatever i think i think it's very very telling that when we talk about it at the nation-state level we call it politics but when we talk about it at the crypto economic level we call it governance which is like the governance has a purpose politics is a game and everyone hates politics but uh governance is like it's like this the the chores like just you gotta brush your teeth you gotta fold your laundry you gotta do your laundry you gotta participate in governance but if we can minimize governance it's just like minimizing all the chores that we have to do every single like week of our lives yeah absolutely um and i think governance kind of highlights the utilitarian aspect of it right we want to do upgrades upgrades are fundamental because we live in this in this exponential world and also because we need to fix the various bugs um whereas you know as you say politics is just it's just become a kind of a show really right right a meat space show yeah depending on every every person has their interpretation of politics and it's generally always negative um okay so going back to my original question like when you close your laptop and and what you get up to uh but excluding your family say justin justin drake has some like alone time some justin some just in time what is what's justin time look like hmm okay um i mean one of the things that i that i do is uh improvising the channel really so um so you know i i used to take uh you know a piano lessons when i was younger but uh you know i i i kind of find it constraining to to have to add here what's written on on the page and and the specific notes and so you know at one point i was like uh you know i just want to do my my my own stuff and uh and i think creativity is is one of the things that uh you know i i i do a lot in my daily job and you know i guess it makes sense to try and reflect that in in in in the music um but yeah so it took me it took me some time to basically um have the the confidence you know i i at first i was just playing random no it was kind of a genetic algorithm right i was i was playing these random notes but then suddenly i started making patterns and then i started making um kind of these these small snippets and then now i'm in a position where you know i can go on the piano and just just just improvise for you know for hours do have you uh do you connect those dots between like your uh lack of interest of being aligned to a nation state which is generally like a top-down ideology to like your lack of interest of being taught how to play piano and rather your desire to like be more creative and improvised how do you connect those two things at all or or any other like aspects of your life that fit into that pattern no yeah absolutely i've always been a little rebellious um you know even in the french education system like the the french education system is very very top-down and rule driven and kind of bureaucratic and whatnot and uh i i just uh very naturally just went against the the the the rules i mean i mean sometimes you know i i had a teacher which would kind of embrace this aspect of me so you know there was this story where i mean it's a little oh ashamed to say it but basically there's uh the my my teacher as i had in kind of in in in middle school and my brother as like was there any kind of genius in in your in your class uh shows he has a teacher and the teacher said no no there was no one i i and and then she said oh actually maybe that i did have one genius but only in one specific domain which was the mathematics and that was you know me um and um and the reason she thought i was a genius is because i was i'm not i'm not non-video genius but the reason why i gave the impression that i was a genius is because whenever there was a math problem i would solve it in a completely different way than the way i was taught so basically it was kind of a roundabout way and and the teacher didn't really understand what i was doing but she always said justin came up always came up with the right answer but kind of the wrong method [Laughter] and she kind of embraced that and was fine with it but a lot of other teachers in the french education didn't didn't like it so much and so that caused a little bit of tension i guess it's really interesting to connect this again this podcast is called layer zero and so we have this like non-nation state identified rebel who likes to be creative and route around problems to discover the right answer like too many of these things are lining up with like how uh ethereum and crypto economic networks like operate at scale at large like throughout the layer ones and the layer twos and like part of my goals with this podcast with layer zero is to like discover the ways that like the dna of of humans and the neurons of humans relates to the code that we write uh and so i'm seeing a massive like direct one-to-one connection with like kind of the stories that you're telling me and how like these this whole entire industry is like built upon yeah i mean i'll say that i also have kind of a bit of a hacker mindset you know i try to find the vulnerabilities i try to find a crack i try to take a route which no one expects and is kind of hidden um and uh you know i i'm kind of the proudly have a kind of a one thousand dollar bounty for for reporting a pretty bad google chrome vulnerability um that could basically uh allow allow an attacker to basically take screenshots of your of your of your of your desktop remotely um but i i also kind of use this this hacker mindset in in research right because in research oftentimes you have a problem and it looks like there's some sort of impossibility result like you can't do something and like the way that you escape in possibility results is is kind of by redefining the problem or redefining the assumptions um you you really don't want to take for granted things that other people took for granted and and basically relax the problem in very subtle ways where where suddenly you you open up a design space um and so yeah this is something that i like doing is um kind of taking something where people seem stuck you know they're not they're no longer making progress they fall about it for a long time and they believe it's impossible and then kind of coming in with fresh eyes and saying and a new perspective and saying actually if you tweak your your viewpoint just a little bit there is a way around it interesting fantastic well justin drake it's been a wonderful time having you on layer zero and i hope this is not the last time that we hear we talk about this and all these subjects and i hope to
