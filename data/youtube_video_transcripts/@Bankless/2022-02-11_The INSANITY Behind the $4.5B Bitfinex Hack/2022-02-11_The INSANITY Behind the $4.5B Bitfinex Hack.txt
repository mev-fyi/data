the world's worst crypto bank robbers that happened this week okay there was an fbi bus a hilarious story all right this should be circulating on late night it's that funny so we're gonna talk about that 3.6 billion heist and it caught up with them heisted by insane people by lunatics okay so for context in 2016 a very significant exchange called bitfinex got uh atta hacked for what was then i think like 72 million dollars worth of bitcoin uh over a hundred thousand bitcoins i think it was like 116 000 bitcoins so remember 21 21 million supply 116 000 of those bitcoins was hacked out of the bit for next extreme michael sailor levels of bitcoin yes like yes that's exactly right i think that's exactly right around the right number uh imagine all of michael saylor's bitcoins getting hacked from this exchange a very big deal this happened before my time in crypto um uh but it just caused a bunch of drama and hubbub and no one knows what happened to the bitcoins um turns out uh the department of justice found the bitcoins uh in the hands of two individuals uh isla lichtenstein 34 and his wife heather morgan uh both citizens uh residents of new york were arrested and charged with money laundering of the cryptocurrency stolen from bitfinex in 2016. the department of justice says that it has recovered a whopping 3.6 billion dollars worth of the the of bitcoin uh i think they recovered something like 90 000 96 000 of the 116 000 so they not not all of it but like significantly most of it so this is a big bust and a good recovery and so you know when i first read this i was i was picturing some like you know elite crypto hackers right there some shadowy super coders right right not only did they heist living off of the united states somewhere else yeah no no you know they didn't only heist billions of dollars worth of krypto but they also hit it for like almost a decade yeah okay so like what are we expecting there and uh yeah so i was expecting some sort of shadowy supercoder to emerge but instead we got something else david what did we get we got these ridiculous insane people who like this the the the woman wants to be a rapper and she's terrible struggling influencer significantly strong rightfully so struggling influencer uh who is like acting like an actual actual lunatic on tick tock and instagram making very just ridiculous raps uh the behavior of these two people who are very very public is insane it's insane who they are they are not right in the head and like i'm trying to like think that it's a show but i don't think it's a show i think it's real um here's a video of her eating these fluffy pancakes and commentating on it you want to do this okay it's just fun it's just good entertainment you know it's one of those things that's like i i watch these videos i'm like why do i even care about this world look at this what's going on this was this was a couple oh my god it's absolutely billionaires are getting weird david that's what's going like this person's a billionaire hacker right mm-hmm uh you know next slide what is this so this is a taron chitra we've had him on the podcast he used to host these like kind of web three uh style talks uh dinners every now and then uh and he hosted heather morgan once uh once at one of these talks in 2019 uh and the uh the the talk that heather gave was how to socially social engineer your way into anything and so she gave like these i'd say she's qualified yeah quite clearly she took her own advice i mean this is three years after she and her husband hacked bitfinex right allegedly bitfinex uh and so like some of the pictures that came out from this were absolutely insane did you have that that tweet here we go how to socially engineer your way into everything from proving cold email tactics to event crashing and infiltrating black markets around the world there's something for everyone all right let's go to the next photo yeah okay useful objects for br event crashing badges press passes professional camera a notebook money for tipping if you needed to bribe people your way out of it a black shirt because you look like security layered outfits and accessories okay so it's so shady we actually we actually don't know how we are still discovering how they actually got the bitfinex bitcoins we don't know that yet uh so that is i i mean this might be the answer right this might be the end they probably socially engineered their way into like 3.6 billion worth of bitcoin right and so okay it's just tldr and social engineering it's not like hacker man where you're tapping on your keyboard exploiting some weakness in big and bitfinexes like walls uh it's it's doing something like calling an employee pretending you're like an exec and you get them to give you some information and so it's a social it's social like you are talking to someone and they just give you something it's way easier and probably like a greater you know weakness in most of our systems and structures uh some places i've infiltrated wow imagine documenting your crimes like this david mm-hmm it's absolutely just for the clout you know you just gotta you gotta make sure everyone knows um this is a tweet from uh alistair uh melin imagine being a hacker or money launderer and keeping the unencrypted private keys to 3.5 billion dollars of bitcoin in an online account linked to your name mind blown are you telling me that this is how this is where the fbi found it it wasn't like on a ledger it's not on some like you know private keys that they manage you know encrypted somewhere this is on a um an unencrypted online account it was encrypted but apparently very poorly so here's from from the doj report they say after the execution of court authorized search warrants of online accounts controlled by lichtenstein and morgan special agents obtain access to files within an online account controlled by lichtenstein those files contain the private keys required to access the digital wallets that directly receive the the funds stolen from bitfinex and allowed the special agents to lawfully seize and recover more than 94 000 bitcoins that had been stolen covered bitcoins uh valued at 3.6 billion uh so apparently it actually was encrypted there's another report and uh the link in the show notes will will provide more details but apparently it's just encrypted poorly uh there is good and bad encryption out there and apparently like so they stored it online with poor encryption um under their names under their own names okay again how we actually know these people attacked bitfinex we don't know we just know that they had the bitcoins and they were like you know money laundering it david why did it take the fbi so long to find this i don't know i don't know like we're gonna have to this is gonna be an ongoing like report we're gonna we're gonna be following this one for a while i mean i i think the other big question is uh okay 3.6 billion dollars uh what happens now the fbi owns it this is the stuff in the past and they've like in in you know previous seizures like the silk road they've auctioned it off right is that kind of what happens or where did the proceeds go who actually should be owned this money yeah so this is part of this big mess and so there is uh bitfenix attempted to make all of its customers whole again via issuing um equity or ious to say hey we're going to repay you guys once we figure it out and i from like my limited knowledge on this is like they actually did make customers whole again via a combination of issuing this leo token which is kind of like a pseudo equity it was like bitfinex's version of bnb uh yeah and you actually could see the leo token price leo was a promise it was either it was some sort of like commitment on like uh value or if you ever got if they ever got the bitcoin equity kind of thing pseudo equity with a promise to repay bitcoins if it was re uh uh seized by the fbi then given back to bitfinex the rightful owner of the bitco of the bitcoins but like customers have kind of been more or less paid out by this by this hack everyone felt good with it more it's not like mount gox they felt like they were made at home right exactly you could actually see the leo token spike in price well before this news broke so like yeah yeah efficient markets yeah right uh and so but now the leo the leo token price which is in theory and iou based on the backings of the bitcoins that's now been seized it went from something like five dollars to eight dollars on the news that the bitcoin had actually been seized but now there's a bunch of drama about who actually gets the bitcoins because people have differing opinions on this uh so a quote from eric voorhees says bitfinex doesn't owe me anything they made me whole years ago if eric voorhees lost some bitcoins in the bitfinex attack but apparently many customers disagree uh particularly given bitcoin's appreciation from less than 600 dollars in august 2016 when the export hack happened to around 44 000 now the tokens were worth about 71 million dollars at the time of the hack the bitcoins with and now is valued at 4.5 billion dollars all all uh there's definitely look this is going to be settled in courts right there's going to be lawsuits from yeah from customer like there's going to be this is going to be a long drawn out process to see who actually gets that money right uh so like some customer says i think that this is ridiculous that's my bitcoin that they took from my multi-stick wallet i would like my bitcoin back on off this customer says he doesn't remember if he signed away any rights to his stolen bitcoin while accepting the big finex reimbursement they can have their equity back says arnoff who claims to own about fifty thousand dollars of illiquid bitfinex dock i'll take my bitcoin thank you very much so tbd on how this bitcoin actually gets distributed man uh hilarious hilarious i guess you know what are the takeaways other than like something like this is going to make the best crypto movie ever like incidents like this so a super cringe crypto movie [Laughter] are you embarrassed that this is why we're making headlines it's like one of those things like if you go like if listeners are that curious go to the link in the show notes go to this uh heather's twitter page and tick tock page and like watch how absurd her behavior is as an individual no no just stay tuned for the moment of zed stay tuned for the moment at the end because one like i'll hide your kids because you don't want your kids listening to it uh it's just you can't make this up you can't if you were to write this down and like give this to like a producer of a movie they'd be like what the hell is this like this is lunacy it's absolutely insane dude it's the best it's the best books will be written movies will probably be made in the future uh this is crypto every week something like this happens we have the expectation where the hackers are like the ozark family i'm not i don't follow this uh watch i just watched it i watched like the last season it's good yeah okay so ozark family i'm assuming some sort of like very professional well done uh optimized uh hackers of some type yeah money they're professional money launderers yeah there you go yeah good at their jobs uh and then in reality we have these two like squares like insane lunatics who uh i mean i guess they were successful money launderers for a while except struggling influencers struggling influencers who had held almost four billion dollars worth of bitcoin on private keys that were on a cloud database and poorly encrypted yeah guys that's the mean of the week just waiting waiting to see what happens next lesson learned if you steal four billion dollars worth of bitcoin don't don't store it in the cloud you want to give them a teaser of the moment of zen that's coming up just don't listen to it it's terrible it's so bad it's it's the it's heather trying to be a rapper don't let your don't listen to it don't let you definitely don't let your kids listen to it but after ryan gives out his disclaimers it's coming i'm a [ __ ] bad [ __ ] go on make me a sandwich you annoying like vag itch so lame it's [ __ ] tragic bad [ __ ] bad [ __ ] [ __ ]
