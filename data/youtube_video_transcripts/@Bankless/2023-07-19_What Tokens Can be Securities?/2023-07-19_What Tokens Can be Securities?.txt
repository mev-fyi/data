tokens like Matic Adam cardano or Securities how can that possibly stand up now that xrp is ruled not as security well I think as to the tokens themselves no difference the logic holds judge forest was clear in distinguishing tokens from transactions involving the token so to be clear could there be transactions involving those assets that you listed that might be deemed Securities yeah for sure but on the exchanges themselves I don't think there is any credible way for anyone to argue that these other tokens are securities when xrp is not in that scenario
