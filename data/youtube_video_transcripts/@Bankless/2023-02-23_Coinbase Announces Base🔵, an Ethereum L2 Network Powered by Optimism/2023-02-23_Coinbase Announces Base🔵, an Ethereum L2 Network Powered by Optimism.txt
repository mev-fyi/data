Bagel Station we have a special breaking episode for you today wanted to get this out to the nation because the news is fresh as of this morning coinbase is launching a layer two chain called base that is the news that just hit the headlines and we've got the scoop David who do we have on what's the significance of this we're bringing on Jessie Pollock who is the protocol specialist protocol lead at coinbase who uh I've titled him as the guy who's responsible for growing coinbase's D5 mullet which is getting a lot longer with this news coinbase launching its own specific layer 2 for the coinbase ecosystem it is built on top of the op stack and is going to be the place that coinbase deposits its millions and millions of users into the world of on-chain activity without having to push them into the high gas fees low latency speed of the ethereum layer one I think this is Ryan the biggest news I can think of since a long time this is massive news coinbase is building its own chain of course binance has binance smart chain uh now coinbase has base uh so what are the decision points that went into making this base chain uh what did coinbase really consider when they decided to do this how long has this been in production why did they choose to build on optimisms op stack what is base going to look like is is it going to be permissioned is it going to be open how like what what are you going to be able to do there there's so many questions and we ask Jesse all of these questions in this coming episode yeah I want the bankless nation to realize the significance of this event because I feel like um David for you and I the reason it's so exciting is because it validates a lot of the core bankless thesis one all at once this uses ethereum as the settlement layer okay and a layer two means it settles to ethereum this is something that that we predicted this is definitely the defy mullet thesis these crypto companies even crypto exchanges will start to build on D5 protocols that are credibly neutral rather than uh cussing everything themselves this is also the way out of all of the 2022 traps that we saw with uh exchanges running away with people's money SPF and you know the block files and the Celsius and all of these things this is a completely auditable open transparent chain I I could go on David but the protocol call sync thesis didn't even mention that all of the bank list thesis culminating in fact we explicitly called um it we explicitly made the call that a major exchange would launch a layer two at some point in time that we predicted that to happen in 2022 turns out we were just a few months late it's happening in 2023. uh great validation really a cool direction that this is going in the first publicly traded us company to launch a major effort on a chain all this boom boom boom a lot of check marks here and this is why this is such exciting news today yeah so we won't hold anything back let's get right into this episode with Jesse before we get in there though we have to make a note that Ryan and I are advisors to the optimism project which is extremely relevant to this story because bass chain like I said bass is built on the op stack and Jesse and the op team have been working very closely with each other so this is very relevant to the uh to the optimism team we are talking with the optimism team on Friday at 10 A.M eastern time for an additional live stream to get at their perspective as well because that is the other half of the story but first we're talking to Jesse from coinbase we're going to get to Jesse from coinbase to talk about all of this amazing news coinbase launching in layer two man I can't say it I could say this other for the rest of the day coinbase launcher Layer Two that's pretty damn cool uh so we're gonna get to that conversation with Jesse but first I want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially Kraken who is our strategic sponsor for 2023 if you don't have an account with them you should get one started right now so go there while you listen to the Kraken ad which is going to start right now Kraken has been a leader in

basically if you put this into a bankless speak Ryan it's Jesse's job to grow coinbase's defy mullet and he's got some exciting new developments on this front of coinbase's D5 mullet Jesse welcome to bankless thanks thanks for having me I'm super excited to be here hello uh Community are you some are you are do you have a mullet right now I can't see the back of your head you know okay it's coming in it's going in you shape it so there is some massive news out of coinbase this morning uh Thursday morning 9 A.M the news just drops that coinbase has base which is a layer two on ethereum Jesse what is this coinbase has its own chain is that what's going on yeah you're exactly right um you know our mission is to create the global crypto economy we believe that crypto economy is on chain and over the last many years we've been trying to figure out how do we bring more of our business on chain and how to enable more developers to build useful applications um and that's what base is base is a platform that we we hope is gonna make it really easy for developers to build dapps make it really easy for those dapps to reach massive scale through the 108 million verified users and 80 plus billion dollars of assets in the ecosystem and Shepard in the next era of the crypto economy that gets us to billions of users using crypto every day well we love all of those words but I really want to dive into like what is base so it's just like a new Layer Two that's joining the ranks of optimism arbitrum a polygon how is how is base similar how is it different like help us get the lay of the land here yeah so base is an ethereum Layer Two um there's no token we're using eth as the native gas token and we're actually building based on the op stack which is an open source toolkit for building chains built by optimism we've been working really closely with optimism on this for the last while we're actually joining as the second core developer of the op stack and we're going to help make that platform freely available open source and as scalable secure and decentralized as possible in the years ahead so this is a huge win for the op stack I've always been bullish of uh the the op Stacks design philosophy which is to do exactly this which is to allow teams easier times to for fork the op stack code base and build up their own layer too so it sounds like coinbase is taking that advantage that possibility and running with it but how is base going to be different so like when we're spinning up a new generalized Layer Two like how is it how is it going to be different from optimism and arbitrum and why what will people find on base that they won't be able to find anywhere else yeah I think our thesis is that um one of the things that coinbase really uniquely has is we have this whole Suite of products both on the developer side and on the consumer side coinbase wallet uh coinbase and the DAP wallet there a bunch of developer infrastructure and I think we believe that if we bring those things together with bass kind of at the center of it it's going to make it easier for two things one is it's going to make it easier so that when developers build applications they can actually then connect those applications to mainstream audiences uh and that's kind of the base offering for developers and then on the user side I think we've seen that it's still too hard to actually use crypto and we're going to be able to integrate base into our products we're gonna be able to make it work by default so that users are increasingly less nervous about am I picking the right chain am I paying the right gas fees and instead they're just able to access the applications that they actually want and I think that like next phase where instead of us being very very chain Centric we start to be more applications Centric and users start to say hey am I getting the actual value that I want am I finding useful things that's that's the kind of next error that we want to be separating in this is kind of cool because this is somewhat of a coinbase's uh Legacy right and making making uh crypto easy and bringing it to uh to mainstream and there was a time when buying a Bitcoin was an incredibly difficult experience and I I recall very distinctly coinbase helping to to make that process a little bit easier one question I have about this base layer too so um it's an evm it's so is evm compatible how open is it so is it open in the same way that an optimism or an arbitrum are open in that any third party can come develop an application on top of it or is there some kind of permission layer is coinbase doing some gatekeeping around this is there like an Apple App Store type model tell us about the openness of this ecosystem yeah and and we you know just kind of as a first principle really believe in decentralization at coinbase uh we believe that that's the thing that enables uh the crypto economy to be open accessible to everyone globally and so we're continuing to upload those values with base the uh Layer Two will be permissionless um anyone's going to be able to deploy on it and then on top of that kind of permissionless platform like on top of the permissionless platform of optimism or ethereum we're going to see uh coinbase and others build infrastructure that makes it easier for developers to do things that they want to do so for instance a good example of this is identity I could imagine us providing infrastructure so developers could more easily recognize who people are recognize that they're humans recognize uh that they live in a certain jurisdiction but all of that's going to be kind of at this application layer and the actual infrastructure layer like ethereum like optimism is going to remain open uh and and Built For This global economy that were creating in the crypto economy so Jesse uh I remember over a year ago it was October in 2021 we had Brian Armstrong on on the podcast the bankless podcast and uh we asked him the question of when is coinbase going to launch its own chain and so we brought up the you know the comparison of uh at the time FTX was going down the Solana path no FDX is no longer a bit like there so I mean like I guess that's gone uh binance was certainly going down its own chain path with what was called the binance chain now the BNB chain we asked Brian hey when coinbase chain when is that going to happen and he seemed to indicate to to us at the time that the timing wasn't right but that when coinbase does enter the market for a chain and and kind of uh throw their support behind some sort of a chain um the values of crypto would be very important values like decentralization values like openness values like like permissionlessness um Brian said like when the technology is ready and he exactly see a path forward that allowed coinbase to have crypto values in a way that could also allow them to create their own chain so I imagine like Brian and the team over at coinbase now saw that that day had come what what is different between I guess a year ago when we asked that question and now this big splash of coinbase launching its own end yeah and we've actually looked at like very seriously launching a chain twice before once in 2020 and once in 2018. um I think both times the the the thing that we've ultimately landed on why we said no was that um we felt like there was too much of a risk of It kind of siloing coinbase off from the broader crypto economy um you know in an alternative L1 or some alternate ecosystem that wouldn't be deeply plugged into all of the incredible building that was already happening in the community and I think the thing that really gets us excited and that really unlocked the potential for us to be doing base is that for the first time we felt like we could do this in a way that was integrated into the crypto economy and that upheld those values and so that's as an ethereum layer too we're deeply integrated into ethereum which is the largest crypto ecosystem in the world the most value of most assets the most developers um we're going to be plugged into that from day one and then also from a technology perspective we're building on the op stack which is open source MIT licensed freely available and adhering to the values that we've seen uh kind of upheld in the ethereum software layer where those kind of values are freely available in open source are super defended and I think for us the feeling was if we can both create a native home for us in this new on-chain economy and take our resources and put them into open source uh decentralized tooling that everyone can benefit from whether they want to build on base or they want to Fork that code base and build somewhere else and we can have that deeply interconnected into ethereum and interoperable with all these other chains whether it's Solana or Avalanche or polygon that's us living our values that's us making coinbase not the place not a island but a part of the crypto economy and the internal value that we say over and over again about this is a bridge not an island we want base to be the way that we take users who are off chain and bring them on chain and they might start on base but then we want them to be so deeply interconnected into ethereum L1 and the other their l2s and the other l1s that they can go anywhere and our products are going to continue supporting Every Chain we're going to continue investing in those bridges and we're going to continue working to bring users into the crypto economy and let them go wherever they you know find the value that they're looking for just yeah I really really like that answer and I want to unpack that a little bit because I think there's a lot of layers to it layers to it it's like that one uh and so like this really is emblematic of the ethereum layer 2 design philosophy and what I've personally enjoyed about the design strategy of the layer 2 roadmap which is that if you decide to build a layer 2 on ethereum you are also synergistically plugged into all other layer twos on ethereum as well and so this is answering the problem the ethereum's layer 2 roadmap is answering the problem of coinbase would like a chain but it doesn't want to create its own Silo it wants to be a part of the broader Global crypto networks and the layer 2 design philosophy does that but that's just one layer of of this it's also specifically the op P stack also does that and so the replicatability of the op stack and the reproducibility of optimism's op stack allows for the base chain to have more synergies with other layer twos because you not neither did you Fork off and create your own layer one but you also didn't Fork off and create your own layer too you also are building on optimism's op stack which makes you synergistic with the optimism uh network network effects and so like this Synergy with the broader crypto landscape at least with the ethereum layer 2 landscape I think is really really strong and so I I just like to say thank you and I'm proud of I'm proud of coinbase and thank you for also seeing the same synergistic Vision between chains that I see in ethereum's Layer Two philosophy now am I just espousing my own biases or is this also what you see Jesse and what coinbase use as well no you're spot on I think that you know two and a half years ago when the ethereum community shifted there the road map from being kind of this execution sharding at layer one into the roll-up Centric scaling roadmap I think this is exactly the vision it's that we're going to have many Roll-Ups that work together to scale ethereum and they're going to be open source they're going to be freely available and they're going to work really well together and that's exactly what we want and interestingly you know one of the the ways we actually started building a relationship with optimism was we started working with them almost a little more than a year ago on eip4844 which is a part of this roadmap for scaling ethereum and I think what we found was that the the the context of working and I guess before I go into this erp4 a44 is also called Proto dank sharding it's going to create a new form of data availability on ethereum that's going to lower cost of Roll-Ups like base and optimism and Arboretum by 10x and likely even more in the years ahead um and I think what we found in working on EIP 4844 with optimism the other client teams was that context of like writing code and contributing to this platform was such a powerful context for building that trust for building the vision uh the shared alignment around what this future looks like and for doubling down on those values of decentralization Open Source interoperability and interconnection into the broader crypto economy so Jesse coinbase has really waited for the technology to get there and the technology is here so you guys are doing this now um you're not first to the party though when it when it comes to kind of other exchange competitors let's say binance has been doing this for a few years now do you think coinbase has kind of a second mover Advantage here whereas like the BNB chain not even the right Benchmark like what is kind of the uh the um the success metric and can you catch up to some of these uh chains that have been in existence for a while in particular some of the exchange chains yeah I mean I I think in the grand scheme of things we're at Day Zero of the growth of the crypto economy you know even if you add up all of the transacting addresses on every chain in the world it's still like less than 10 million transacting addresses probably less than a few million real humans who are transacting on chain every month a few million every month there are billions of people in the world and over the next five to ten years we're going to get all of those billions of people transacting on chain that's the future we're headed towards and so I think first and foremost we just believe we're at day zero on this and there's so much growth and so much opportunity for everyone to grow the pie and work together and growing that pie um in terms of binance smart chain in particular I I think that binance has done a really admirable job like pushing the limits of what's possible on chain you look at the activity that's driven on that platform there's probably more real user activity on chain through binance smart chain than any other environment kind of in the world and so I think as we look to that there's a lot there's a lot to like there's a lot to admire I also think that when we think about how we want coinbase and and base to operate it is this value of kind of interconnection into the the crypto economy contribution back to the public goods that are that are kind of supporting this work that's why we're building as an ethereum layer too not as no alternative L1 that's why we're committing as a core contributor to the op stack um not just taking the technology and going doing our own thing with it that's why we've been working over the last year to ship code in ethereum to scale ethereum for everyone not just coinbase but every L2 and everyone in the world I mean I think that uh prioritization on the decentralization on the interoperability and on the the open source Foundation that we're building together is what's going to make bass really stand out as a contribution to the broader ecosystem that's that that you just pulled out that we probably have just a couple million maybe a few million users who have ever gone on chain that is a subset of the total amount of coinbase users so how many coinbase users are there right now like in total yeah I think the the number that we shared uh yesterday in our earnings is about 108 million verified users um as of the end of last year um and so most of those users are using our custodial products um where we have pooled wallets where we're managing their crypto for them whether it's Bitcoin or ethereum or any of the other hundreds of assets that coinbase supports um and we think that's a really great first step for people you know you have to start somewhere and I think the thing that we've seen over the last few years as we've built products like usdc and coinbase wallet and CBE is there's so much opportunity for the emergence of really powerful applications that are on chain native and that's where we increasingly want to be bringing our customers with coinbase not just serving as an exchange and a custodian but really the gateway to web3 where users are going to get access to these apps that give them like real world value every day yeah so Jesse I'm just kind of running the number so uh just a few million people on chain right and so like this is the population of like a reasonably sized U.S city that that's all that we have of people going bankless for this entire Movement we only have a few million right now but coinbase has 108 million is that what you said registered users not even verify verified users who have gone through the whole verification you know done their identity verification we're just looking at like your platform one to two percent that have converted to full on-chain users right and so I'm wondering if like success for coinbase looks like well you get that to like 10 you get that to 20 you get that to 30 imagine if you had 30 conversion from a coinbase verified user to an on-chain user uh going bankless well I mean that would massively like we're just talking about 10xing the on-chain ecosystem I'm not going to say overnight because that will take some time but but coinbase has traditionally been a gateway to crypto and can become this gateway to layer 2 into on-chain experience now that the bandwidth is ready the transaction fees are cheap is that the idea here 100 we believe that on chain is the next online and that over the next five years we're gonna onboard billions of users and that is our goal onboard billions of users uh help them obviously come on to base but also help them go to other layer twos help them go to ethereum help them go to anywhere they want in the broader crypto economy to access the you know good services and products that they're looking to oh so when you first uh said that bass was going to be a fully open fully permissionless new Layer Two on the scene my first reaction was like well how are they gonna compete with all the other layer twos like like optimism arbitrum like polygon already have like a flourishing app app layer and bass is showing up for like like you're a year or two behind like how are they going to compete but then but then like unpacking this is like oh coinbase has all of the people like it's got all of the users and like that's what like Arbitron optimized us they'd love all of those users and so my question to you Jesse is how is coinbase users how are they going to be presented with bass like is this going to be is bass going to be the like the first on-train experience you think for many coinbase users and coinbase maybe bass is like this safe playground before you venture out into the wild unknown of crypto world first just start with bass and and so like coinbase will funnel their users into base first and then perhaps you can go on to the ethereum only one overall like how how will coinbase receive coinbase's users yeah so I think you know uh like Ryan said it's going to be a process where it's going to take time to integrate based into all of our products and to bring all of our users on chain I think your head's going to exactly the right place you know what we're seeing is anytime you're helping user come on chain um you know you have to present them with options or help them make decisions for instance I want to bring my first five dollars of usdc on chain where do I do that um and I think right now a lot of the experiences are like well here's 10 places you can do that and the users are like okay well like yeah like how do I make those choices and I think we want to continue making sure those choices are available like that's so core to the ethos of crypto that there's no lock-in that's open and for the 99 of users who are just looking to use the applications whether it's payments or borrowing or lending or trading or games or social we want to take away the fear and uncertainty of I have to pick between 10 different infrastructure providers and make it so they have a default experience that works out of the box for them puts them on chain where they can go everywhere else so I think that's that's like you know the first big place that you'll see uh based starting to get integrated into coinbase product Suite I think the second place and this is like a broader thesis that that uh I haven't that we have which is that I think over the last few years as we've kind of seen the rise of tokens um we've seen what amounts to a lot of like very inefficient um ad spend or user acquisition where people are spending huge amounts on token airdrops to acquire user a small amount of users um to use their products and what that says to me is like there's a lot of missing infrastructure for helping users figure out what the valuable products are that are going to help them you know live their lives better um and I think that's another thing that we're really excited about is basically how can we build tools both from an organic perspective but also from a paid or you know I yeah like paid perspective to give developers access to those users to put you on the front page that users are interacting with and then help you find the users that need your product and bring them to your application and one mental model that I really use for this is if you look at pretty much any Financial Service that exists outside of crypto whether it's a credit card or a bank account all of those things users change primarily as a result of a financial incentive you get a credit card bonus of points you get a bank statement bonus that's usually motivated for the vast majority of consumers by some Financial incentive to change their behavior from bank one to bank two from credit card one to credit card two and right now I think we're missing a lot of the infrastructure to do that in an efficient uh and user-friendly way and so I think one of the things we're excited about is how do we help the industry build a lot of that infrastructure So eventually we can go to all 108 million years and say hey here's an incentive to come on chain because on chain is actually the best financial experience you can have and not only are you going to get the benefit of doing that from just being there we're willing to pay you to move because it's going to be so much better for your day-to-day and I think that connection of bringing in the incentives and helping users make that change is going to be really powerful I I totally see that vision and I'm wondering about if we can take the uh perspective of a coin based uh shareholder uh how does base chain uh impacts the value of coin or just like where's the value proposition here like what's the value proposition for the base layer two for the value of coinbase as a whole yeah um I think what we've seen over the last 10 years is that the key thing that coinbase offers consumers is um being an easy and trusted interface to access crypto and I think what we've also seen is that for the last 10 years mostly what users are using that interface to do is to speculate or to trade um and that has been valuable for coinbase because we provide an easy trusted interface to trade and then we generate revenue on that from taking fees I think our thesis is that um over the next five years there can be many many more things that needed easy trusted interface and if coinbase can continue to provide that easy trust in the interface there can be many many more ways for coinbase to generate revenue from making it easy and trusted for users to do those things and the problem that we've seen is basically there just aren't enough useful things to do in crypto yet and so our bet with base is if we create a platform that makes it really easy for developers to build the next generation of applications that make crypto super freaking useful then that's going to create the opportunity for coinbase to create all those interfaces to those applications and that's going to create a huge amount of new business for our bottom line so Jesse you guys aren't worried about base uh cannibalizing your business maybe maybe you're pushing more traffic into this kind of defy ecosystem and maybe that somehow harms The Core Business of coinbase has that been a consideration you know I think that uh we've been pretty consistent uh over the last two years even if maybe Wall Street won't listen to us coinbase is not an exchange like there's an exchange that is a part of our business but coinbase is really the gateway to web3 gateway to the crypto economy um you know Brian wrote the coinbase secret master plan in 2016 which we can we can maybe talk about because I think it's a good one to talk about like he wasn't like we're gonna be in exchange for the rest of our lives because like exchange is step two and there's four steps and I think we're getting to those later steps and those later steps are about building an entirely new economy on chain the crypto economy and coinbase's role in that is going to be the gateway to that crypto economy and we think ultimately that that's going to be a massive business um that we're super excited to grow and not only is it gonna be a good business it can be good for the world because it's going to increase economic freedom globally and it's going to be basically a rising tide that lifts all boats and puts everyone on a Level Playing Field where they're all operating in the same economy that gives them stability shuri Surety and access to financial products that make their lives better I'm really not surprised Wall Street hasn't caught up uh on this idea they're they're a little bit slow to crypto Jesse uh I'm afraid but that's why we can front run the opportunity of course so like yeah one of my the question that David asked is basically a question of uh how'd your business guys let let you do this um another question is how'd your legal guys let you do this how did you get this by compliance right I mean we are entering 2023 and this is like things are getting a little hot in the US I don't know if you've noticed and I know uh coinbase has always played things uh by the book and maybe this is outside of the scope of the conversation here but like you guys are launching a decentralized chain right as a publicly traded us-based company how does that work is this like good from a legal compliance perspective I imagine would have to be or else coinbase wouldn't have rolled it out uh do you have any takes on this yeah um and I thought Brian actually had a pretty good tweet on this a few a few weeks ago maybe a week ago he said something like um when when everyone one is uh you know nervous about comms it's the best time to build and that's kind of how we feel about this is like there's so much noise in the industry right now about regulation of course that's important we you know Brian and Paul are up there working with Regulators to get a common sense framework for crypto in place in the United States and Beyond and we're not going to let that distract us from our mission which is creating the global crypto economy and in order to do that we need to invest in underlying infrastructure that powers that crypto economy in terms of base in particular I think we have um staunchly defended as a business the ability for folks to to participate in ethereum is taking for folks to run validators and I think we see this as an extension of that base is a scaling Solution on top of ethereum it is offering people the ability to bundle transactions and publish them on ethereum in a permissionless and decentralized way and it is contributing to the underlying infrastructure that's going to power This Global crypto economy that we have to be working to protect and preserve the sanctity of and so has this been a complex legal in Regulatory and compliance challenge absolutely you know like you said this is in many ways unprecedented no no other large public company has launched uh you know Layer Two blockchain And I think we're lucky to have probably the best legal compliance privacy Finance teams in the world working on crypto right now um and I'm lucky to get to partner with them on a day-to-day basis and uh we're lucky to get to work with other partners like optimism and you know the whole list of partners that we're bringing this to Market and and to find a path where we can do this in a decentralized way in a a way that that works within the the confines of the law and that brings the best of crypto to our developer customers our user customers in the world so in line with the questions about regulatory risks will there be a base token there will not be a base token no plans for a base token um I think our thesis on token a is that um you know having ethereum as native gas token is super important um you know this is a layer two uh we're paying the actual costs for publishing transaction batches in ethereum and so we're going to take those fees in ethereum I think that there's a lot we can do with account abstraction over the next year which is another thing coinbase is investing in to make it so users will be able to pay in whatever token they want and you can have kind of a pay Master manage that exchange but ethereum is a native gas token that was never a question for us uh more broadly on tokens I think one of the the feelings that we have is that um one of the things that can happen in crypto is because there's this new Financial incentive it can almost at times obscure the product Market fit that platforms or products have in the market and I think one of the things I'm excited about is um I think we're going to have real product Market there with this kind product I think we are going to have uh probably the first chain that has access to large-scale Consumer distribution that is embedded in ethereum that runs evm that's decentralized that's integrated into broader crypto economy and I think that is going to have product Market fit and then we're going to drive down fees we're going to build better infrastructure we're going to build better wallets um and it's going to work and I think that to me is way way more important than using a financial incentive to gain metrics or drive activity um and that's that's our plan for base so you don't need a coin to juice the growth you're doing this old-fashioned way you're just building apps that people want to use huh we're just doing it the old-fashioned way building apps that people want to use uh and not just us I think that's the important thing like this is not Base building apps that people want to use and coinbase building apps that people want to use yes of course we'll have first party products that we want to offer but for us it's all about how do we enable everyone to build apps that people want to use and how do we make sure that we're creating the infrastructure from now we're driving down the fees that we're increasing the decentralization so that it's actually possible to build those applications that billions of users want to use what about the validator set is this going to be only coinbase doing the validation of the chain or like who gets to run this network yeah so we're going to be running the sequencer to start and then over the next year or so we're going to be working to decentralize that sequencer that's one of the reasons why we're really excited about partnering so closely with someone like optimism we're basically running a joint roadmap with them now uh where we're putting our resources behind accelerating some of these really critical engineering challenges um and and sequencing is one of the big ones um for the the time when coinbase is running the sequencer we won't be doing anything with Mev it's just going to be kind of uh transactions are just going to be ordered based on the time they enter the mempool and the priority fee that they set that's really important to us um we want to make sure that you know there's no perception or reality of coinbase trading against our customers and so we're going to basically offer that as a neutral mempool that anyone could execute in and Jesse remind people the the god powers of the sequencer right so it's different than being a validator David used the term validator but that's kind of maybe it's uh similar but that's that's more of an ethereum validator where you have like lots of uh god mode ability but with a sequencer it's primarily you have god mode over ordering the blocks you can't actually can you halt the chain with with this ability uh what are the powers that a um a sequencer would have and coinbase would have before it goes fully decentralized yeah so the the sequencer you're exactly right it orders transactions um there is the ability you know for the sequencer to Halt but the the the control of the sequence right what is sequencing is actually defined in the L1 contracts and there's a mechanism in the L1 contracts that allows people to do what's called a forced inclusion which basically allows them to include a transaction uh outside of the path of going through the sequencer and that's really the thing that gives l2s they are kind of decentralization characteristics it's that you have the rules of the system defined in L1 in the smart contracts in L1 and then those rules are enforced on the sequencer and the network that's running on L2 and so is there going to be centralization at the beginning yes there's going to be some centralization at the beginning and we're going to be working over the next year and Beyond to remove that centralization as quickly as possible and make it so that this is you know as decentralized as ethereum as a platform and I think most importantly of all there's nothing in having that the sequencer ability even when it's kind of centralized only coinbase is doing it nothing that would allow you to go all SBF and go you know take the funds and uh you know rug retail here exactly right power the sequencer has yep that's exactly right now sequencers ordering transactions uh you can still submit at the L1 um and your your funds if you were to kind of bridge over you could kind of still submit and pull them out of the the chain as bankless as possible for a network these are the properties that we love to hear about and Jesse what's the timeline on this uh so this is an announcement of a future chain the chain is not live today uh what's the timeline on this thing the test Net's live today um so if you want to build your developer go to base.org and you can start building on the test net um the test Net's actually been live for a little more than three weeks so we did Genesis on February 1st of this year and we've been working with kind of Builders uh who are early uh to kind of be pressure testing that chain um but yeah if you're if you're a developer build it build it you can start building at base.org there's documentation there's rpcs we have node providers we have block explorers everything's ready to go we also have a bounty at East Denver next week I'll be giving a workshop at East Denver for for Builders we have a couple panels we have a hacker house at East Denver and so if you're interested in building and you're interested in building on base please come find me come find us we'll be pretty obvious in terms of mainnet our goal is to bring mainnet in the next few months one of the things we're benefiting from here is that we're not building a chain from scratch we are running the op stack and contributing dop stack we've been running the OB stack for months now internally and contributing to the op stock code base from for months as well and that's going to let us progress a little more quickly from testnet to mainnet than if we were going out and saying hey we've built this whole new L1 system we need to get it all pressure tested battle tested optimism has done an incredible job uh building the op stack auditing the op stack running bug bounties on the op stack we're actually extending coinbases uh I think Market leading bug Bounty program with a million and a half dollars of coverage um to include the op stack and base um alongside the existing bounties that that optimism has and our goal is to work with them to make this the you know secure decentralized open source freely available forkable platform that anyone can use to run a chain okay I have been holding my breath this entire time talking about the op Stacks I will take every single opportunity to talk about the op stack and just you said the word op sack like 10 times and so we're eventually going to have to get into these subjects but one last question before we cut for a break and then get into all things optimism and op stack and the op Collective and all the synergies between the coinbase and the optimism optimism team one last question the the vision for base is to be a be a fully decentralized Layer Two eventually uh right and it's like the idea is eventually it'll be a permissionless validator set it'll launch fully centralized with a centralized sequencer which only again like like we talked about only has some certain powers but it'll still be a coinbase uh validated sequenced chain but the vision correct me if I'm wrong is for is base chain to be a fully permissionless validator yeah and you know vitalik has the classification that we've been working through uh has been helping more fine of kind of a stage zero stage one stage two roll-up with Stage wheel having like a stage zero having most or all training wheels and stage two having no training wheels and our expectation is that when we hit mainnet will still be a stage zero roll up but we'll progress very quickly to a stage one roll up um definitely by the end of the year and then we're actually going to be able to become a stage two roll-up in 2024. so that's kind of our North Star it's like zero to one this year and then one to two next year and when we get to two we'll be kind of inheriting the full decentralization characteristics of ethereum and again I I don't think that there's a way that coinbase could have done that alone like there's just no way if we had started working on this six to nine months ago and we said we're going to build a roll-up and we're going to decentralize it in you know six to 12 months um there's just not a path and that's why we're so excited about both obviously working on the technology with optimism but we also see the collaboration almost as an active decentralization like doing the work to set up a core contributor group to have all core Dev calls to think about how do we manage the multi-sigs that are that are managing these things how do we actually bring these together over time to increase interoperability that is decentralization and I think by putting ourselves like our first step um uh into the on-chain world from a chain perspective being done in a collaborative way I think is a real Act of decentralization okay so we have to get into the subject matters of the op stack because there's there's so much to talk about here coinbase is joining op Labs as the second official core development team after uh of the op stack after op Labs uh I want to talk about how that relationship got started but there's also strong ties between the base chain and the op Collective so a percentage of base chain transaction fees are going to the op Collective so we're going to talk about that Jesse you are joining the retroactive public goods funding uh as a as a rpgf badge holder and you're going to start and be a member of that and start to participate in optimism uh in the governance of the optimism Collective there are so many things to talk about and like there's a grand world in the optimism uh vision for the world I want to get your take on it but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon on arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 unit swap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and unisop's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon but that's just staking Phantom is also the best home for your nfts Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your nft experience pin your favorites hide your uglies burn the spam and also manage your nft sale listings from inside the wallet Phantom is of course a multi-chain wallet but it makes chain management easy displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites Phantom has already saved over 20 000 users from getting scammed or hacked so get on the Phantom waitlist and be one of the first to access the multi-chain beta there's a link in the show notes or you can go to Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop and Bank location we are back with Jesse all about the base chain out of coinbase but we're gonna get into the tech stack that base is built upon and Jesse's been talking about it a lot and it's been getting me really excited and so Jesse can we just start back at the very beginning why did coinbase elect to to choose to build base on the op stack how did that relationship start like what was the thought process going behind this uh just can you lead us into this conversation yeah absolutely um so we started working really closely with the optimism team actually not related to the op staff in L2 a little more than a year ago on eip44 we talked about that earlier but it's all about scaling ethereum Optimum op labs and coinbase basically came together and said hey we want to make this happen sooner than sometime in the future we're now on track to ship eip44 sometime this summer that's been a huge collaboration across the a lot of people don't know that that coinbase was involved in that so coinbase as a core Dev is kind of a different mental model as well giving back public goods to the community yes yeah I you know I I feel uh I never want to claim the title of cordov you know the teams that have been building those clients for the last many years they have just done such an incredible service and I feel like over the last year coinbase has started to contribute to the core development process and the the approach that we've taken is like let's just put our money and time and effort where our mouth is by showing up and writing code um and it's been super awesome process people have been incredibly welcoming they've been excited for us to be there and I think we've had a big impact you know like when we started working on 4844 at the beginning of 2022 um the timeline was like sometime in the future maybe 2024 um and now you know we have a commitment to ship this as a fast follow to the Shanghai chappella upgrade that's happening in late March early April um and we have four devnets done including the last one that we all spent a week on at interoff working on together where we have now all clients participating in it we're working towards the fifth devnet and the spec is basically done and implementations are basically done and so I think we're trending towards uh you know summer release which will have a huge impact on not just base not just optimism uh but every L2 and that's that's kind of the ethos so anyways going back to optimism we started working on that with optimism uh beginning 2022 uh third working on ethereum with them and that actually came after in the beginning first half of last year coinbase basically ran a process because we saw a lot of teams internally struggling with the question of like how do we build on-chain products like literally what smart contract language do we use do we use evm do we use rust and Solana do we use a Cosmos app chain and we basically decided hey people are already defaulting to evm coinbase products all support evm evm has the largest developer community in the world like let's make that the paved Road internally and once we made that decision then it was like okay now we gotta go scale ethereum because this is where we're going to be deploying our applications and so that's why we started working on 4844 and then in the second half of last year we spent a lot of time basically thinking about like what's the technology stack that we'd want to build on with Layer Two um that's when we started to believe that there wasn't just gonna be one layer or two but there were actually many layer twos that worked in collaboration um this vision of the super chain that we've been working on with optimism um and I think that's when we built a lot of conviction in the optimism team from a technical perspective um the optimism op stack code base from a technical perspective and a modular perspective and the optimism ethos around having the code be open source MIT license freely available freely forkable and having this whole infrastructure that they've built around funding through retroactive public goods funding all of the the public goods that support the crypto economy um and so I think those three things really combine to make this uh uh an exciting choice for client base and one that we're really excited to be pushing forward so I want to ask about your involvement with uh the op Collective so you are now a card holding member of of the collective can you talk about what you're going to be doing now over there yeah so I'm I guess just to clarify I'm a uh badge holder for the latest retroactive public goods funding round um which is uh basically a a moment where optimism is taking some of the revenues that are generated by optimism mainnet and returning that to builders in the community who have contributed to the broader crypto ecosystem and so this can be all the way from you know things like death which is the execution client that's powering optimism to block explorers to applications and and badge holders are basically responsible for looking through the I think it's around 200 applications for funding um based on retroactive contributions and saying hey which of these are um you know really had a positive impact and how do we elect kind of which ones to give funding to and so I'm really excited to participate in that process I think it's one of the most novel kind of Cutting Edge experiments happening in on-chain governance right now and it's one that has a really like amazing and Powerful purpose this which is funding this public goods work that makes our entire industry possible um so that's that's how I mean that involved in optimism one thing that I always do like to clarify though as I'm going through these conversations is um I have no op Holdings I have no investments in optimism companies I never have the only op Holdings that I have are the ones that I earned an airdrop um uh totally unaffiliated to optimism from using ethereum and I think that's you know an important disclaimer this was really a decision that was driven by the technology uh the team and the ethos around decentralization that coinbase is really excited to contribute to Well Ron and I will have said this in the intro to this episode but I'll say it again here Ryan and our advisors to optimism and a large part of that comes from we share the same vision that optimism has about retroactive public goods and creating this like Star Trek sci-fi future of incentive and coordination alignment and and the ability to freely for fork and grow the code base and so it starts we're seeing what we see in optimism it seems to be that coinbase is also seeing the same thing in optimism and just to really just to clarify this last point you said there are feet there are of the base chain the base layer two some percentage of fees transaction fees like gas fees if you call them are going to the op Collective what percentage is that we're not sharing the percentage right now but we're actually going to be doing that whole uh uh process on chain that was really important to us we want to make it so everything's on chained uh so it's transparent so it's visible to the community and that's something we're gonna be working through in the months ahead but yeah we're really excited to be contributing back to retroactive public goods funding through the optimism Collective that felt really important to us that we didn't want to just Fork this thing and go our own way we wanted to become a part of something bigger than us that we felt could create a real decentralized foundation for the crypto economy alongside ethereum and that's that's what we're doing hand in hand with optimism there's that proverb if you want to go fast go alone but if you want to go far go together and that is really just the op stack instantiated at least from from my perspective uh and and so I really want to ask you Jesse so you are not building on top of the op mainnet you are forking the op code base to build a new layer 2 called base using the same code base as the optimism made net but is still not on top of the optimism mainnet and so which brings us to a word that we've used before the Super chain which is uh the optimism Vision it sounds like you're you're also privy and and believe a believer in this and so the idea here is that everything every chain that's built on the op stack the boundaries between these things start to blur and so you know more is there going to be like Network switchings like oh I'm on polygon now I'm going got to go change my my metamask down to arbitrum the op stack vision is that if we all use the same code base all of these change start to meld and so even though bass is a separate a chain from the optimism mainnet because of the common denominator of the op stack a lot of the complexities of being across different chains starts to become abstracted away this is my vision for the op stack this is something that some of the op teams has shared with me is this also your vision and can you articulate what you see in this Future Super chain world yeah 100 that that's our vision you know I think what we've seen as we've been kind of building based and thinking about this more broadly is application developers are going to have all sorts of needs for instance if I'm a you know D5 product it's really valuable for me to be on a like very interconnected Hub chain like bass that's going to give me access to other D5 products that's going to give me access to users but that's probably a different use case or need than if I'm a game developer where like I need to be having a lot of transactions that are moving really quickly to run the whole game engine and I think ideally we'd be in a world where those applications could run in parallel and work really well with each other I think that's the vision behind the op stack it's let's build one code base that can be configurable and be used to support different developer needs and be structured in such a way that those instances can work really well together and be increasingly interoperable so we we have a long way to go to build that Vision you know to get from here to there to start base will be standing up alongside optimism mainnet and then over the years ahead we're going to be working together to converge them and to make them interoperate and to bring a bunch of other folks in to create this kind of broader super chain that scales ethereum uh Jesse doing a little side quest here it was also your effort to bridge in the kzg ceremony in ethereum into coinbase users uh and so uh I Ryan has some reasons um that he's going to also apply to you for I'm going to front run him and applaud you for that one is it seems to be that Jesse is really taking in the best of what ethereum has to offer and making that scalable and access possible to all of coinbase users and so just thank you for what you're doing with uh helping coinbase lead the charge into what we see as the right direction for crypto I appreciate that yeah I mean the kzg ceremony that's just been such an incredible effort shout out to Trent and Carl and the whole team that built that uh I think we just crossed 50 000 contributions coinbase had ctas for it on Twitter we sent an email to our users we put it on coinbase.com a huge uh a number of people inside of coinbase work to make that possible and it's all about contributing back to the public goods infrastructure that we're building on you know coinbase could not uh do a lot of things we're doing today without ethereum base could not exist today without ethereum and activating our users to contribute to securing ethereum and scaling ethereum feels like the least that we can do it feels like an essential contribution that we need to be making to these platforms that's super cool Jesse's our decentralization mole inside of the organization and uh look I know I know coinbase and Brian uh really value these things and and support these decentralized values too but sometimes it takes a little bit of foresight and pushing against the grain and uh getting active in the community and I appreciate you really kind of bringing that internally and leading that charge I know it's not just you Jesse and you'll probably be the first to be like there's a whole team around you I'm saying this not just to Jesse but everyone who is working on a project that is not taking shortcuts taking the long path towards public goods and uh maximally uh decentralizing the thing so uh Jesse I want to ask you this as we kind of close and this is for David myself this has been um some of the most exciting news I think that um we've actually seen in crypto maybe for me personally I don't know if David you'd say the same thing since the ethereum merge uh for sure and the reason is this is a thesis that we've had for a very long time a very very long time this idea of ethereum as a settlement layer this idea of publicly traded companies building their own chains that settle down to ethereum we've called uh I know the economies probably wouldn't like this phraseology but like when if you hold a customer assets you are sort of a bank and we've talked about Banks building on top of ethereum um we've talked about credible neutrality wins winning we've talked about the D5 mullet we've said explicitly that a major exchange this is a prediction last year that I think I I held that didn't come true in 2022 I guess we were distracted by other things but in 2023 is coming true which a major exchange would launch a layer 2 Chain and it's happening this is like the bankless thesis playing out and it's so exciting so so much of this announcement uh leans into so many different bank list Aces that we have been pounding the drums it's long game it's long game uh and I love that you're doing this but so let me ask the question of if base is maximally successful in like five years what do you think it looks like um users apps what are people doing do you have some sort of definition for for the future state for for this project that you've you've launched and undertaken yeah and before I talk about the future and I appreciate all the credit I do obviously a huge credit to the entire internal team at coinbase that's been pushing this forward I think we have a hundred plus contributors that have helped in some ways they've been we've been giving out nfts over the last nine months to every contributor as they've joined um and so that will be you know on chain on the record it's also showed on base.org about which is really cool we get to render everyone's ens profiles um uh but also like just a huge shout out to Brian Armstrong like six six years ago in 2016 uh bear Market before in 2017 bull market Brian Armstrong wrote the coinbase secret master plan which was a four-part plan the first phase was build the protocols Bitcoin and ethereum the second phase was build the exchange coinbase exchange the third phase was build the consumer interfaces it's coinbase wallet metamask trust wallet coinbase dap wallet fourth phase build millions of doubts that bring billions of users into the crypto economy he wrote that six years ago and we think about bases phase 3.5 it's the platform that makes it possible that makes it easy for developers to build those millions of apps for users to use those millions of dapps and for billions of people that come into the crypto economy and so when I think about what five years success looks like um I said this earlier but it's it's that on chain is the next online it's that this is not a like thing of like are you have you tried crypto it's like crypto is powering every single part of our day-to-day experience um whether it's the money that we spend the money that we save the games that we play the social apps that we use those things have been re-platformed from this online platform which has been incredibly powerful from an information perspective and giving everyone access to information everywhere but it's still been beholden to that same centralization from a money perspective from a value perspective and those products have now been re-platformed onto this on chain platform which has the same information characteristics of being globally available and for the first first time from a money and value perspective is also globally available it is also a Level Playing Field that anyone can build for and I think that future that future where our everyday lives are powered by the on-chain crypto economy is going to be it's gonna be incredible and base is going to be at the center of it um with optimism with ethereum and with all of the other people who are going to be using the op stack or other toolkits that interoperate with the op stack which is also great um to scale the global on-chain economy bullish Jesse very very bullish as we end this so uh what is the uh the emoji for bass are we doing the the blue circle is that the thing we're doing the blue circle we say we say that the blue circle represents um kind of the platform of crypto it represents trust it represents Surety security it represents economic freedom I think we've had the green money sign for a little too long um and we believe that the blue circle the foundation um is you know the next thing uh the one sad thing about the blue circle which I'm very sad about is you can't add it to your Twitter name or your Twitter profile um because they don't want it to look like the verified symbol now you can add it to your forecaster name or your lens name and people will be doing that um shout out to the centralized social media being built on the on chain platform um but the blue circle is what it's all about you uh we're recording this on the 22nd you've probably seen the blue circle teaser that's on the internet today tomorrow we'll be talking about the blue circle talking about bass and talking about what we think is the next chapter of the crypto economy there we go blue circle bullish we'll see if we can get Elon Musk to uh change his mind gotta get him on on Bank list first uh but uh this is so very exciting Jesse thank you for sharing uh this news with us today and the entire bankless Community super excited to see yeah thanks for having me y'all this is awesome action items Free bankless Nation gotta end with this um base.org it's the name of the website that just went live today with this announcement I will include a link in the show notes to that also David and I bankless has a stream a live stream is a live stream David with the optimism team that's coming tomorrow so that would be Friday the 24th I suppose what time are we doing that stream David that is going to be at 10 A.M eastern time so we'll get the optimism side of this equation as well now that we've had the uh the coinbase side of the equation of course gotta end with this none of this has been Financial advice how dare you think that it was all of crypto is risky eth is risky so is D5 you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier we're off to explore New
