what's up coordination how you doing today's episode is with daniel schmuckenberger who is a systems thinker with a deep breath of experience in game theory political history economics social sciences and i am just so elated to be bringing this begging you this episode uh daniel schmokenberger is someone i discovered several years ago on the future thinkers podcast where he was discovering and discussing systemic risks to humanity so beyond just climate change but what he calls the meta crisis which is well you're gonna have to listen to the episode to hear what the medic crisis is basically we're looking for the systemic game theoretic underpinnings behind the the meta crisis and all of the coordination failures worldwide daniel is a founding member of the consilience project which is aim at improving public sense making and dialogue and you just hear it in his voice when he's talking he's a deep understanding articulateness and lucidity in which he's talking about systemic risk and that includes climate change ai risks uh biodiversity loss all these sorts of things that are happening as humanity is running into its planetary boundaries on planet earth and i think that this is probably one of the most important episodes that we've done because daniel has thought so much about what he what he sees as the meta crisis and our ability to solve the meta crisis by creating a a third attractor towards a better world so uh this episode is going to be the part uh the first part of a three-part series in which we're going to be discussing what is the metacrisis and what would a third attractor look like for solving it the second episode we're going to talk about criteria for solving the metacrisis and the third episode we're actually going to talk about web3 dals what we've seen with the history of bitcoin ethereum icos d5 nft dowels we have a global coordination substrate in order to solve coordination failures and so we're bringing the web 3 communities technology knowledge computer science knowledge and combining that with game theoretic design and political history knowledge from daniel schmokenberger and we're going to try to figure out how we can address the meta crisis so basically this series of episodes is very special to me i think daniel is extremely lucid and i'm so thrilled that he decided to come on the green pill podcast to talk about the meta crisis without further ado i give you daniel spockenberger the opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto community with web3 support and a non-custodial

let's dive into the deep end what is the metacrisis and how could the third attractor be a way out of it yeah so uh just for preface we're getting into the meta crisis which is a a way of trying to assess the totality of risk the world faces and the totality of the problem space that can kind of allow us to wrap our heads around what humanity needs to do in a big picture sense as opposed to all of the uh separate catastrophes why is this worth talking about uh because it can easily seem like doom porn or something um or just a way to demotivate people i do believe that this is actually something humanity can rise to the occasion of an address and it's uh the famous charles kettering quote goes a problem fully understood as half-solved and the corollary of that is that a problem not fully understood is probably unsolvable right because you're trying to address something that is leaving out critical elements and so this is not to uh be overwhelmingly catastrophic it's to try to understand the problem space well enough that we can really think through the design criteria of adequate solutions and obviously you are uh you know a central node in an ecosystem of tool builders that are trying to work on coordination net governance which is so like what are the coordination needs of the world what are the governance needs of the world this is this is kind of what we want to share the metacrisis as a frame for so um hopefully what we do in this first episode is try to share a picture of the state of the world that gives some constraints on what has to happen by when what are some of the underlying things to address none of this is obviously very web 3 specific right but then the future episodes that we do will be um informed by so that said what is the meta crisis most people are aware of climate change as a possibly catastrophic risk through a number of different vectors and well before the full like venusification of the planet you start to get extreme weather events causing massive human migration we had extreme weather events affect australia massively but in areas of low population when that happens in india bangladesh pakistan and iran like extreme weather events in high population areas high population density extreme human migration resource shortages hitting political amplifiers um you start to have things that can lead to breakdowns of supply chains and large-scale war from climate change before climate change is fully catastrophic just via the planet inhospitable so climate change even isn't one thing it's a lot of things right and it's one of a lot of other catastrophic risks environmentally a lot of people are increasingly aware of dead zones in the ocean from nitrogen runoff as a result of unsustainable agricultural practices and total biodiversity loss and pollinator loss and uh erosion of topsoils and biodiversity loss and overfishing and it's like okay because the larger frame there is planetary boundaries we have been running a linear materials economy that extracts under nobly from nature and then turns it into trash and pollution in nature much faster than nature can reproduce those things that we need as raw resource or process to waste and that linear materials economy is connected to a financial economy requires exponential growth year over year which means we're trying to extract and externalize exponentially more every year from a finite planet while you start to hit boundaries at some point where it's like we're just running out of stuff to extract and running out of capacity for pollution so the planetary boundaries model and the forecasts associated like the mit limits of growth model are mit club of rome limits of growth are ways of saying there's not just hundreds of different environmental catastrophes they're all the result of some deep underlying stuff like an economic system that requires embedded exponential growth attached to a linear materials economy that just doesn't work right like at a certain point you got to change that thing right on top of this people are aware of from a crisis point of view because even if they weren't involved in like forecasting catastrophic risk and reading things like nick boss from superintelligence when people like elon musk and um henry kissinger start talking you know very publicly about the artificial intelligence risk um being arguably the most catastrophic near-term pressing risk to the world it's like okay well that's not climate change or environment that's a whole other thing right and that is similarly not one risk it's a lot of risks there's there's artificial general intelligence doing its own thing risk there's artificial intelligence optimizing for the wrong things and causing really powerful externalities like the ai algorithms that already run facebook's news feed and instagrams and youtubes that are increasingly polarizing the population breaking democracies that's already like right causing catastrophe let alone weapons or whatever yeah and then you have um biotech existential risks because exponential technology makes exponentially more powerful stuff exponentially cheaper which means small smaller groups have access to catastrophe capacity right and so exponential tech makes like nuclear level problems accessible to not just g8 nations but all kinds of smaller groups over the next handful of years that's a big deal it's very hard for the world to see how we could make it through with drone weapons and bioweapons and ai weapons and cyber weapons how does the world make it through that well so if we look at all of the environmental issues all the exponential tech issues all of the fragilities of our global supply chains and the escalation pathways to war at scale where the post-world war ii system is breaking down for a bunch of reasons we can get into collectively we can kind of call that the metacrisis and the cinematic crisis is not one particular catastrophic risk it's looking at all of them because to make it through you have to prevent all of them to fail you only have to have one of them happen so we really have to take that holistically and then to think deeper about it is to say man is this really like a thousand different issues that are all separate that we have to think about individually or do they all have certain underlying patterns in common where if we think about those patterns address those it would address everything else is there some way in which these are all symptoms of underlying issues and obviously your audience will be very sympathetic to the idea that coordination failures are underneath all of these right part of why we have the environmental issues is because it's very hard to have any country decide to tax carbon if any other country doesn't because it's going to hurt their economy and hurt them geopolitically and to make an international agreement where everyone will takes international enforcement that is really hard to do right that's a coordination failure it's like a giant prisoner's dilemma a multi-polar prisoner's lemon multi-agent there's dilemma which is all a multi-polar trap so multi-polar traps meaning anybody starts over fishing then nobody has a reason to not overfish because the fish will all get anyways and no one has the ability to protect the fish only have the ability to exploit it and might as well be you rather than them if they're going to use that to grow their population would say they're going to beat you in in finance and geopolitics and war with and the same with if they're going to build the ai weapons you better build them faster if they're going to build the bioweapons you better build them in the defenses faster so you get these races to the bottom in a bunch of ways so the arms race the tragedy of the commons the first mover market advantage of tech that externalizes a lot of harm these are all examples of multi-polar traps this is one example of something underneath all the crises so the meta crisis has to solve multi-polar traps metaphorically not this particular one or that particular one so the metacritic frame is actually quite useful because then we say trying to solve each one of these issues and every time a new technology occurs a new arms race happens um so as we are having the cumulative effects of industrial tech hundreds of years of industrial tech bring us near planetary boundaries and an exponential rate of the increase in distribution of catastrophic power from exponential attack it's like okay we're gonna have higher probability on more risks each year there's no way we can just keep protecting each one in a triage wave we have to get human coordination to be fundamentally better and this means things like we have to address perverse incentives how do how do we categorically identify where there are incentives of institutions or agents or corporations that are deeply misaligned with other agents of the commons and how do we correct those or not because any problem that you're incentivizing you're gonna have a hard time solving right how do we fix perverse incentive writ large it has to be a core question everybody in every institution every technician is thinking about all the time right how do we identify externalities and internalize them it has to be a core question how do we identify multipolar traps and resolve them these are like generator dynamics generators of the metacrisis it so let me just say back to you what i heard to summarize for the audience so it sounds like the metacrisis is like a lot of different crisises it's the dead zones in the oceans it's climate change it's pollinator loss it's biodiversity loss but it's not just living capital it's it's ai risk and uh technology breaking democracy uh it can be biotech existential risks we've got nuclear level technology being decentralized into the hands of everyday people um in a world that has increasing fragility because their industrial age institutions are breaking down and on top of that we've got these planetary boundaries which are fixed and we're running this linear materials economy with an a political system that has to have exponential growth in order to function like the governments literally forecast two to four percent growth as a baseline for each of their economies um and so basically your approach to this problem is we have to solve all these problems we have to solve more than just climate change and you're looking at the systemic generator functions of these problems in order to solve the giant prisoner's dilemma multiple trap uh arms race tragedy of the commons that's beneath all of them and and so you're kind of looking at the systemic generator functions of these existential risk as a means of solving all of these different metacriticis did i get that close uh that was the best recap i've ever heard that's why i'm smiling great um so uh i think that the second question i i the first question i asked you is what is the metacrisis and then the second one was what is the third attractor as a way out of it so let's let's pull that thread yeah so third attractor obviously indicates that there's two other attractors attractor is this idea of in a very complex system we might not be able to predict exactly the path something takes but you can say it's it's trending in a certain general direction like almost a topological direction so when you think of attractive basins like think about a watershed uh what particular pathway of raindrop flows down the hillside impossible to predict right navy or stokes are quotient equations on fluid dynamics are actually unsolvable to be able to say if it falls on this side of the mountain range it'll end up in this lake is pretty easy right like the water is generally going to be converging to this lake on this side of the mountain range it's going to go to this one so it's like oh there's an attractor this entire side of the watershed has an attractive basin so even though we can't predict all of the specifics we can see general direction so right now we would say there are two very high level attractors that the direction of the world and the generator functions of the metacrisis are heading towards they both suck that we don't want and one is increasing catastrophes and breakdown and the other is dystopic control control structures so catastrophes and dystopias at the consilience project we have some papers on um chaos and oppression and stuff like that where we're looking at these models so catastrophes we just talked about right um and the catastrophes don't have to be like one of the major nations launches a strategic nuclear war it can be the entire global economy keeps doing what it has to do and the and nobody's trying to cause climate change but climate change as a or dead as a externality of the thing that it has to do um is the example of the coordination failure ev the distributed collective action is leading to a collective catastrophe that nobody wants but nobody feels like they can solve because unless everybody agrees to do the other thing anybody trying to do the other thing loses in the near term right and so the catastrophes are not the result of somebody trying to do some dumb catastrophic thing they're the result of the coordination failures and that kind of attractor dynamic the same way that it's like with climate change or any environmental issue it's very distributed it's the entire market causing them because almost every movement of goods or services has an environmental externality right and even digital goods depend upon material supply chains to make semiconductors and transistors and servers and satellites and like that so the almost every dollar that transacts in the world something like 100 trillion dollars a day has environmental externalities that's a big deal to get right like okay there's some very deep things about our economy that have to change so the catastrophe's direction is very decentralized and uh as tech gets more powerful there's this idea that we like of like oh exponential tech will like democratize everything like and democratize everything sounds nice superficially but the democratization or giving to everyone catastrophic capabilities not such a nice idea right like it's kind of nice that only the g8 have nukes it'd be kind of nice if no one had nukes and if anyone has nukes it would be nice that it's not that many people and they can monitor each other and do mutually sure destruction it's very hard to make news right there's not that many places that had uranium enriching uranium is really hard you can see it being done from satellites when we start talking about cyber weapons that are pretty easy like small groups of hackers can do in their basement but then you can take out infrastructure targets they can kill a lot of people right mess up a lot of stuff that non-state actors can use in their basement with no exotic materials that's really tricky the same with drone weapons the same with tabletop crispr which is coming about the same with gpt-3 and it's more advanced ai that can make turing tests passing propaganda ubiquitously the next few years so decentralized catastrophe weapons for everyone not such a good thing right now how do you prevent that stuff if if people can make catastrophe weapons in their basement the first obvious answer for how to prevent it is well you have to know what people are doing in their basement so surveillance state could prevent it and you kind of right it makes sense to have surveillance if someone can do something so catastrophic you don't want to wait till they do it right you wait till somebody shoots up a school it's really a bummer but as you go from a knife to a gun to an ar-15 as you go from that to a tabletop crisper it's way worse and you kind of can't wait for people to do it you got to be able to preempt it okay well um how do you make a surveillance state that can know what everybody's doing in their basement that does not is not susceptible to capture corruption becoming a totally legal dystopia and similarly how do you control all of the markets to not do its in market incentive without something that looks like global governments because again if if u.s wants to or europe wants to price carbon properly they will price themselves out of existence relative to china or india if they don't do it also right and if somebody says we won't make the ai weapon and the other one does they win so in order to really be able to solve those problems you need something like international agreement which only means something if you have international enforcement right has that much power and how is that okay and so it's like on one side we really don't want global government because we don't want dystopias on the other side we really want global government because we don't want multipolar traps so this is where the two attractors are catastrophes and dystopias because typically make to prevent the catastrophe requires a enforced control structure and the control structure that has enough monopoly of violence or monopoly enactment or enough power to keep this thing from happening how do you create checks and balances on it so those are the two attractors when we talk about a third attractor it's how do we make a world that avoids all the catastrophes and isn't dystopic meaning that the control structures that prevent the catastrophes have checks imbalances on themselves that prevent them from being corrupt and so whatever world we want is definitely in that third attractor i don't think anybody is like i want the catastrophes or the dystopias model so it's pretty easy to agree on we want something not those two as a starting place right so what i heard is that like you can almost imagine the third attractor like in order to define the third attractor you need to define the first two attractors and you can kind of think of these as just like general directions like waters i'm in colorado so i'll just use the rocky mountains like water going on the west side of the west slope of the mountains versus the east sides those are the two attractors of the water basins in colorado we're talking about a game theoretic incentive gradient in which we have two attractors the first attractor is society is moving towards catastrophes which is having those systemic meta-crisis risks that we talked about earlier and then increasing dystopias which is kind of like centralized control i want to say china here but i'm i'm not sure if you'd agree so like the two axes are how well are we selling solving the meta crisis with coordination and then the other axis is how centralized and corrupt is the system of surveillance and and we're looking for a third attractor that allows uh solving of the meta crisis without dystopic surveillance and governance is is that fair yes okay and um if people haven't watched it there's a really great youtube video it's about 18 minutes uh from a guy named cdp gray called rules for rulers and um first to just go before that if people have not read it there is a article called meditations on molok um on slate star codex meditations on mohawk is kind of the best article out there describing multi-polar trap so this thing that we have like a decentralized coordination failure and i'll go ahead and just try to state it succinctly because the catastrophes are largely the result of this kind of moloch multiple trap side which is where you have a number of different agents where each agent doing what is in their own rational like authentic rational best interest in the short term leads to collective behavior that is in everybody's worst interest in the long term right and yet where nobody can make the good long-term choice because they lose in the midterm if they do so what i think you call about like really adaptive to becomes obligated obligatory because if you want to keep up in the economy you have to adapt the the sort of defection in order to keep up with everyone else whether it's if if they start if somebody else starts cutting all the trees down and we don't have some enforcement to stop them then me not cutting the trees down doesn't protect the forest it just means that they get all the economic advantage that they'll use in war against us so now we'll just race to cut the trees down faster or the climate change of the whales or the whatever that's a tragedy of the commons we solve those nationally with a monopoly of violence and law right so we can say no you're allowed to log these areas but not the national parks and if you try to lock the national parks we can send a police force that has enough monopoly of violence that even if your loggers bring some guns out they're not going to right but without a monopoly of violence and rule of law you can't really solve that thing and so within a country law is a way to try to solve a multi-polar trap by centralized capacity right violence then you start to worry about oh does that centralized capacity get corrupt does it actually do the will of the people democratically or does it get corrupted gets corrupted now we get kind of dystopic police state things and so we can see this teetering between those now as soon as we deal with international issues there is no ability to do rigorous enforcement because now the police state since you don't police it across it looks like so we can do sanctions and stuff but at a certain points like the war is going to hit us back hard enough because we don't have monopolistic power that we have a deterrent against giving them the deterrent and so and especially if the other guy has nukes so let's say china doesn't want to um tax carbon properly because it would hurt their economic growth too badly so we really can't because otherwise economically we're so we say okay well we're going to do it and we're going to force you to do it well how are we going to force them if it's we can tear off or whatever but if they're like no ultimately we're just going to do this and we're going to win are we going to bomb them if they also have nukes so this is where the tragedy of the commons gets tricky right um there's a lot of small scale tragedy of the commons where eleanor ostrom or like local law stuff works but when you get large scale with a lot of power invested in it it gets much trickier and the arms race if anybody builds the weapons and we don't know if they are or not because they could be building them in an underground base and who knows we have to assume they are and we'll just build them anyways we have to race to get there faster and the market arms race their build they're going to get first mover advantage if they get first mover advantage they'll they'll win everything because you're going to get especially in tech with that has network dynamics whoever network dynamics and met castle all lead to natural monopolies right you end up getting one google that's bigger than every other search engine you get one amazon that's bigger than all the other online stores one facebook that's bigger than the other social media as a result whoever gets to like the um uh takeaway effects the runaway effects on netcast law is going to win so you have the incentive to not avoid externalities to just go forward as fast and aggressively as you can silicon valleys um move quickly and break things deal with it later so anyone who tries to be thoughtful about externalities moves slower just loses so it's maladaptive to want to solve this problem so the it's maladaptive because ultimately there is a perverse game theory that orients towards people who are more focused on upside than avoiding risk because if i'm focused on selling the benefits of the ai or the crispr the whatever and not the risk heavily then i'll get first mover advantage and i'll win and all of the risks all the externalities i won't have to pay for my company have limited liability protection and i'll ex i'll socialize the losses so facebook didn't have to pay for breaking democracy and polarizing the left and right and whatever but it got to privatize trillions of dollars of uh kind of gain and so the incentive is to not take risk seriously and this is why we actually need laws because the market does not incentivize long-term thinking appropriately in a lot of these areas so meditations on moloch multi-polar trap that gives you that side but the rules for rulers is another version of the same phenomena but for centralized coordination like centralized power system corruption rather than decentralized poor coordination and it basically says you can't really have enlightened dictators long term because let's say to avoid that multi-polar trap situation you do create in a a centralized authority that has a monopoly of violence or monopoly of enactment and you put a really enlightened dictator or an enlightened small group process in there uh in an oligarchy or whatever well if there are some malevolent people who really want that position of power and they're willing to do malevolent corrupt  to get there they'll probably win because if they're not constrained by values they want more possibilities available so for the enlightened dictator to stay in place they have to be able to deal with the malevolence aimed at them which makes them less benevolent and more malevolent so there the race for who can get in the position of power ends up having a corrupting influence that's the what the ruler thing shares and so this is why you don't you're like okay well power tends to get corrupt this way we don't want a one-world government we want something to check it but if you don't have a one-world government you get this how do you stop arms races and global tragedy of the commons so people should definitely read meditations on warlock watch for rules for rollers and say okay the third attractor has to solve both of those right uh so at this point i i listeners will probably know but you may not know this that in the 2019 uh crypto bear market meditations on molok went viral it was something that really met uh meant a lot to us in the ethereum ecosystem as uh coordination failures were sort of um given this this prominence as the highest thing that the web 3 ecosystem could solve and there was actually a dao that was launched called molok dao that uh is sort of interesting meant to to solve coordination failure so i think most of the audience is probably really familiar with meditations on bullock and we'll put links to that and rules for rulers in the in the show notes so they can go check that out i don't i don't know the people at moloch or what it's doing it's kind of exactly the wrong name but like i get it yeah um yeah i i could see that uh really what you wanted to i think eula was the name of the god of art and softness and all of the uh the kind things in the meditation zombolic uh piece and bollock is the god of coordination failures they named it after the thing that they were trying to slay in in a funny sort of way so the tricky thing that's very interesting is it's like let's take a let's take a small personal example of this large thing small personal example is if someone has grown up with ideals about um kindness and honesty and virtue and turning the other cheek and uh redemption for everyone and things like that not everyone did grow a lot of people grow up with just a lot of trauma and but let's say somebody did grow up yeah they really try to enact that awesome at a certain point if they have enough success and they get enough power then they become a a tractor a honey trap for people who do not have those values and go oh that looks like a sucker that i can um uh take advantage of and then they realize that there's a lot of dark triad personality disorders and pretty  up then the naive ideals to cynicism the cynicism is like man the the no good deed goes unpunished and you know the people that you trust the most end of you know whatever well that's not a reasonable place to go or to stay but you also can't go back to naive ideals you have to move to this like post-cynical right there's naive in like a post-cynical place that is focused on how do those virtues actually get enacted knowing that there are some people who don't share them and and will even try to game and play them so how can i be aware of people who are willing to be bad actors do i deal with that while still working to be a good actor find other good actors coordinate with them and even help the bad actors like help there be more incentive for people to become good actors not bad actors how do i ensure that my life energy is working on the world moving towards good actors for everyone effect which requires not being by bad actors in the meantime the reason i bring this up is because when people think about what is the ideal world they want to create it doesn't include other people badly motivated trying to it right and it's a world where everyone cares about the comments and cares about each other and are kind of like virtuously motivated and honest the transition from this world where people have been incented not to be that thing and traumatized and conditioned to get ahead game theoretically the transition from this world to that world is different than trying to just win at this world which will just keep being in service of moloch but it's also different than being in a world where you don't have to protect against moloch because it's already been defeated you're like okay i am very committed to not being in service of moloch i'm also committed to not being naively just duped by moloch and beaten so that means that i have to be um i have to be game theoretically aware and i have to be able to build things that have power but they're ultimately really authentically in service to transcending that so i just want to um i've been sort of uh diagramming a little bit as we've been chatting and i just want to see get your reaction to this little diagram that i made right here um so i've got a two by two matrix on the screen and basically the x-axis is how well are we solving the meta crisis coordination failures uh the top end of this is really well and then the bottom axis is not really well and then the other part of the 2x2 matrix the y-axis is how centralized and corrupt is the system of governance and surveillance and then the bottom left where we're not solving the coordination failures um but we've got maybe decentralized something decentralized or maybe laissez-faire you've got catastrophes which we've learned about the coordination failures that are created there because of meditations on moloch in the top right quadrant we've got dystopias and those are centralized but they may have solved the coordination failures and rules for rulers are kind of the the what we're looking for there uh the third attractor is trying to solve for solving coordination failures but without a centralized corrupt system of governance and so the problems that we have to solve there are how do we solve coordination failures and slay moles but how do we up level the actors that are good actors and not get by the bad actors i'm cur i'm a pretty visual person and people who are listening to this in audio are just gonna have to forgive me but i'm curious if this two by two matrix resonates with you at all daniel yeah it's really good i like it the one thing i would change about it is i and this is good that you put it there is the um the x-axis it says how well are we solving for metacrisis coordination failures i would not define the metacrisis as the catastrophes i would define the metacrisis as being stuck between catastrophes and dystopias where exponential where our increasing tech and exponential tech makes both catastrophes and dystopias more likely so on the bottom x-axis i would say how well are we solving for catastrophes i see and how well we how well we prevent both catastrophes and dystopias or corruption is how well we're solving the metacrisis right so the metacrisis is yes correct metacrisis is angled like like you're doing there visually okay and then what that means is your bottom left corner is catastrophes your upper right is dystopias your bottom right is we have a third attractor your upper left which would be the worst of everything is the one that we're currently doing and that's actually worth noting which is increasing catastrophes and increasing dystopias at the same time so let me explain that quickly because that's actually the most probable thing um which is you don't get uh an agi that kills everything right away and you don't get strategic nuclear war that kills everything right away you get increasing catastrophe so covid sucked worse than a lot of things before it and now the ukraine russia war sucks worse than the wars we've had before and um the level of polarization in the u.s sucks worse but it's not a full-blown civil war it's not full-blown world war yet but it's kind of like moving that direction so then with each catastrophe comes control mechanisms to try to deal with it that centralize power those centralized powers either start or get corrupt or at least get captured by corruption at a certain point because that's the way it happens so let's say the first cyber attack on infrastructure that really stuff up happens or the first drone attack on infrastructure really stuff up happens then we justify a bunch of surveillance and it won't be the good type of surveillance it'll be the bad type of surveillance right and already we can see that china has learned from the us model and other places and it's like no if you just let all the tech be developed by the private sector the private sector gets so powerful when you have trillion dollar corporations with exponential tech they're stronger than the nation state the nation state can't bind them you stop having rule of law and those new corporations basically become a feudalism that kills the nation state so we actually have to keep all of our corporations in check and by the way since we know how powerful exponential tech is because we're developing it you also need sesame credit and an iot surveillance system they're not stupid they're actually taking the problems of decentralized catastrophe weapons and the decentralized catastrophic capacity to the nation state of major corporations seriously but they're doing it in a way that we would consider a level of centralized control that we're not okay with as far as civil liberties go so what happens right now is you get a little bit more catastrophe and then the world says oh my god this is so bad we have to deal with it and the response involves something strong enough to deal with it that involves granting more authority to some agencies we've already seen this like every time you have a 911 then you get a homeland security act and a patriot act that creates less oversight and more corruption of government because they can't share everything because it's national security secrets and the constitution can be suspended for some period of time under fema or whatever it is right so you have this play where each catastrophe motivates us to want a solution enough to accept a dystopic one and then the dystopia is not a global control system so now you just have multiple control systems competing in a more fierce arms race driving other types of catastrophes so the upper left quadrant there is catastrophes and dystopias driving each other and so one of the reasons i like to frame this together is and the reason i like the metacrisis frame and this is not to dissuade anyone from doing anything it's actually at first that's what it feels like it's like this is too hard to do anything but that's just whenever your the complexity of the problem assessment goes up and you're not used to it your thinking isn't there of course you're not going to be able to come up with solutions at that level of complexity but once you spend a while and get used to it and get comfortable with it then you can start thinking about solutions at the right order of complexity you just have to like stick with it for a bit um it's quite easy if i take an individual catastrophe to solve for it in a way that makes another catastrophe so for instance can i feed hungry people in an area where people are starving with more conventional agriculture with npk fertilizer that increases the nitrogen affluent and causes more dead zones and oceans faster yeah of course can i do certain types of geoengineering for climate change that might cause other really catastrophic effects so can i try to [Music] solve climate change by some global kind of tax on carbon that actually leads to world war three because if all of a sudden gdp goes down rapidly now each country's need for more stuff means they have to take it from each other as opposed to a very positive some situation so if you're focused on climate change and you're not focused on how to prevent world war iii in the economic relationships you're going to be a problem and so you can drive you can solve one catastrophe and make other catastrophes more likely or you can solve catastrophe as a whole and make dystopias more likely i also i have some friends working on anti-authoritarian tech how to prevent the dystopias and they're making catastrophes more likely and so what i want is for somebody to be who's anyone who's thinking about this to be able to think about all them and say how do i solve for this catastrophe well not driving other ones or dystopias how do i make sure that solving for this catastrophe means being able to have some kind of visibility into the dynamics that would cause it and some type of control mechanisms or enforcement how do i make sure that that one doesn't externalize harm to other areas which means i have to understand the connected map enough and how do i make sure that that enforcement mechanism has enough checks and balances on itself that it it isn't corrupt and can't be captured by corruption and that's just okay now i've got the design constraints to be able to think through it and of course the first lots of ideas will be wrong but that's the important thing is to hold there are dialectics of constraints where you can easily make something better and make something else worse and that is one of the drivers of the metacrisis one of the underlying drivers of the medic crisis is that we define problems too narrowly and then we solve that problem and our solution drives other problems and so if you want to solve the if you want to stop making the metacrisis worse you have to make sure that whatever you're solving isn't making other worse right right yeah so it sounds like basically any attempt to solve for a catastrophe or a dystopia can end up having an unintended consequence in which you're trying to solve catastrophes you create more dystopias you're trying to solve for dystopias you create more catastrophes and what we're looking for is a trade-off space in which we're not kicking the can further down the road uh in in order to to make that happen is that right and if so how do we do it i can say that there's a lot we can discuss on how to do it that we will do over this series of conversations and nobody myself included knows the whole that story yet like there's a lot that we have to discover and that's why a podcast like this makes sense is to help the parts that we do know to be more widely shared so that we have a higher starting point so more people's collective intelligence can be focused on solving parts we don't know yet right yeah so i think we're kind of trying to create a a shelling point for more people to be learning about catastrophes and dystopias or i think you once told me that these this is maybe we're creating a false attractor or an attractor towards people solving that problem and hopefully that gets more people thinking on on these problems which increases the likelihood that we can solve them well i don't want it to be a false attractor i wanted to be a real attractor so like for me if i see climate change like climate change for people who have spent some time thinking about it and studying and caring about it see the extinction rebellion movement and groups like that being like whoa this is so serious we need to like get all hands on deck and focus on this and they realize there's a lot of force against solving it and it's a tricky thing for me looking at all the other connected issues i think it's even harder you were just watching some of the conversations nate higgins and i had together and it's uh yeah great stuff maybe that can go in the show notes but like his work really highlights that uh global gdp and global energy use are almost perfectly correlated they're 99 correlated where meaning um increases in efficiency of tech that can make more dollars per joule only change the correlation by one percent which is not enough to even keep up with the increased demand so we can pretty much consider them tightly coupled right if gdp and energy use are tightly coupled and gdp has to go on an exponential curve just to keep up with interest which compounds loan debt or anything else uh that means an exponential demand for energy and we're already at a diminishing return on hydrocarbons meaning it takes more barrels of oil to get new barrels of oil than it used to be and that's why we went to fracking and and tar sands and offshore oil drilling and like not just the easy stuff is because we've already tapped a lot of the easy stuff and so now we're going into the hard stuff and you get diminishing returns so if you're getting diminishing returns on energy density and internal energy investment at the same time you're in the verticalizing part of an exponential curve on gdp and this energy demand you got a problem that's it's imminent and you're and the answer of renewables something like from 2019 to 2021 the um increase in demand of energy is more than all renewables ever built so like yes we're doing more renewables but the demand is going up on an exponential curve and the renewal is a lot of  energy right like it takes a lot of coal and oil to make a solar panel and to make the batteries to back it up so if it takes 10 years for the solar panel running to just break even on the oil it took to put into it then to try to meet all of the energy needs plus make all that new stuff it's like whoa this is really tight okay so we understand that it's not just that dollars and energy are coupled but pretty tightly dollars and energy from hydrocarbons are coupled because the other solution is just not really totally convergent yet well climate change sounds it makes sense why it's so hard because it's not just going up against the oil industry it's going up against the market itself right because if you make energy more expensive you make every industry more expensive because there's an industry that doesn't need energy if you make energy it's real cost meaning the cost to pull the co2 out of the atmosphere and to clean up the oil spills and to make renewable hydrocarbons then energies goes up to a million dollars a barrel or whatever the it is and the entire market collapses no market works right so you're like all right so we're trying to solve climate change is like going against the entire global economy it makes sense why it's so goddamn hard right right that's just one issue right then yeah that is not the ai issue or the biotech issue or the yeah and so then you're so for me when i look at each of those issues and i see how hard they are and i see them as individual issues if i think of them all as separate it's impossible like there's just no way that we can do what it takes a thousand of them death of a thousand cuts yeah when i see that all of those issues are instantiations of a couple deep patterns like the pattern of perverse incentive the pattern of incentivizing externality the pattern of multi-polar trap and like there's really only a few of those patterns that account for all of it that actually moves it from feeling impossible to really really hard but tracking it's like those few deep coordination things we have to address and they do require changing human motive so that's both external incentive and and uh you know judicial systems but it's also human values and culture and it's also the effect that mediates them so there's like there's tech infrastructure stuff we have to do there's like little economic social stuff we have to do and there's totally like cultural value system stuff we have to do and we have to do some stuff in each of those three that intersects each other and leads to virtuous cycles in time right um when i get to see the entirety of the metacrisis it actually starts to move from feeling impossible to tractable really hard detractable because like oh there are patterns across all of this and it's impossible at the level of all the symptoms but at the level of the underlying drivers we can at least start to wrap our heads around it immutable x is the layer two platform for crypto gaming immutable offers massive scalability with up to 9000 transactions

i wanted to make sure that we got to uh in in this conversation is where your hope comes from daniel because i don't want listeners to leave this episode thinking oh we're all and i don't think that that's that's what you're saying it's from the nate higgins podcast when i listen to that you all talked about a lot of uh ben not break so basically what is the aperture through which the humanity could steer itself through the meta crisis in which these systems bend but they don't break uh the systemic risk is not realized in systemic downside for humanity um and i want to ask you where your hope comes from daniel and and and um you know what is the hope for for solving the metacrisis and the future of humanity on this planet and and you know how do i look my my kid in the eye and have hope that they're gonna have a non-dystopic uh and uh non-catastrophic life let me start with like three or four or five quick examples that will be so high level they might seem hand-wavy but they're real of specific ways that the tech that is oriented to breaking stuff in either catastrophes or dystopias currently could also be repurposed to build a third attractor and i want to just give a couple of these examples because it is not currently the case that the financial incentive or the political motive and regulation or whatever uh where the market incentive is such that the tech is being built for these purposes it's totally or the two attractors we have but it could be like the tech is definitely new capacities and it could be oriented towards things that are really in the right direction so i want to give a couple of these examples and there's way more like we can pretty much show for each example of technology how it could be restructured in both the design of the tech and the regulation around it and et cetera that it orients or server tractor then i want to go to the deeper part about what about human nature is inspiring for me and then the even deeper part of like uh relationship to the topic of hope or faith itself um so tech there's a group called planet labs a company it's a publicly traded company the largest private satellite company satellite imaging company in the world uh team over there are friends and we've been in conversation recently because they image the entire surface of the earth every day and so their customers are only the very very large government and corporations that have the kind of uh machine learning capability to process 30 terabytes of compressed information into something but as they get the machine learning capability to process that and deliver a more usable product to more people and they're getting more satellites with more sensors the real-time ability to see everything on the surface of the earth is emerging in a way that is not actually controlled by any government there because of laws regarding being in international airspace they actually can show in detail what's in the military bases of us china russia everywhere that's happened like it's just but that also means they can show where the fishing boats are that shouldn't be and where they came from they can show where the logging is happening they can show where the mining dams are breaking and the toxic affluent is going out and they and be able to rewind where the fluid and the dead zones in the ocean are that's a level of forced global transparency that makes international agreement much more possible because it makes the transparency to track the agreement possible where then enforcement mechanisms have a chance that's a humongously promising thing like that's a big deal to be able to say like oh actually you have no plausible deniability on who did that pollution or who did that illegal fishing like we know exactly where the they came from we can press rewind and watch the entire thing well that helps multiple traps right because one of the things that makes multiple traps worse as you know in the prisoner's dilemma it's that it's a lack of communication that makes coordination if you can't know what the other actor is doing everyone has to assume the worst thing and then just race to do the worst thing if you can know what they're doing right so if you can force transparency and remove the opaqueness uh advantage then you can make better coordination right you can make better nash equilibriums that's one example of many examples and obviously blockchain is very oriented to forced transparency being a net positive thing right i think there are many examples of forced transparency because of tech combined with new solutions where transparency wins over opaqueness um obviously you look between militaries and they try to make all of their military stuff national security secrets and classified so they can have a upper hand in a military conflict so there is strategic advantage on asymmetry of information but there's downside too the downside is you start getting to a place where uh everything is classified and or so much i was classified because of national security the integrity of democracy is totally broken down because the population can't actually know what's going on because if the population knows then china or russia or whatever can know and therefore the faith in government goes down everybody's afraid of corruption but they say it's the other side it gets more partisan like the the classification is part of the breakdown of the democratic system which means that it's driving autocracy movement towards autocracy the other thing is that the classification becomes compartmentalized and so you end up having different departments duplicating each other because they don't know and nobody being able to do adequate intel across all of them and even some of them competing for who gets a larger percentage of the black budget if you could make them transparent and get enough benefit from the transparency because you can use machine learning to process the data across them and then help optimize coordination across them then even if you give up some of your asymmetry of advantage asymmetric information advantage you get new advantages of not having to invest all of that energy in opaqueness getting more buy-in of the population and less breakdown of democracy and way more efficiency which is uh what the swedish government does and it's actually prototyped as working in a major nation with a major military so if you take forced transparency and you take solutions that make transparency win can you start to drive increases in transparency where the game theory orients a race to the top rather than race to the bottom yes that's an example beautiful now i can give you another example technological automation both because of robots and ai portend a loss of enough jobs that the capitalism is not a viable solution for humanity in the next pretty soon period of time whether it's 10 years or 30 years whatever it's soon right um okay so either this becomes dystopic as as can be because at least in feudalism you needed people's labor and so the people couldn't be too terribly treated because you didn't want violent you know revolt if you have a situation where the elites don't even need the people's labor they're just useless eaters uh that could get really bad right and the robots in ai can do stuff faster and so how do we have a situation in which the market will choose the robots and the ai because they're faster and cheaper um how do we have a situation which that is occurring that isn't dystopic that's a really important question like and if there's a very deep existential question if robots are better than us at certain things and ai are better than us at certain things what are we still better at that is what we should be developing humans to do and or what is intrinsically meaningful to humans and what you end up getting is like outside of full agi sentient agi things that involve authentic connection are things that you're going to want humans to do rather than automate could we automate and most of things that you could automate if people didn't need the jobs and money they'd rather not spend 40 hours every week doing anyways because if it's automatable it's fairly rote and it's not the most engaging thing and yet high connection things are intrinsically rewarding right like evolution rewarded high connection things so could we have a situation where a much higher percentage of the entire population are educators like one in four people as opposed to one in 40 or whatever and a much higher percentage are nurses but the nurses are trained as much as doctors because in doctors similarly doctors aren't going to do the surgeries anymore the da vinci robots davinci machine type robots are going to do they're going to do a lot of the diagnostics they're going to so then the role of the nurse and doctor becomes much more the interface of the ai and the interface of the patient it's extremely high touch extremely high care that gets all the qualitative stuff that the quantitative thing can't get same with the educator we don't get to have the world-class minds become educators because they it just doesn't work they go into other areas but you can't grow world-class minds with teachers who are not world-class thinkers right so there's a study that showed that the highest statistical correlator for people who became world-class mathematicians was that they trained with a world-class mathematician oh wow so it's like fractal you're not going to learn to think like a world-class mathematician from someone who doesn't think that way right it's like if you're talking to a fields award winner versus your high school math teacher they don't think about math the same way right and so your brain learning math is going to learn it in your mind is to learn it really differently which is why the aristocratic tutoring model is the thing most known to correlate with super genius which was the aristocracy were able to hire the smartest people in the whole land to tutor their kids this is why marcus aurelius's first chapter of meditations was just dedicated to his two tutors is when you is to be the emperor of rome the best mathematician and rhetorician and philosopher and grammarian are your teachers of course you're gonna be way the smarter so now this is another question about hope can we make a world where gpt3 can already and should now imagine gpt 12 right can already not just pass the turing test as a chatbot pretty well but do it in the voice of specific people i can train jpt3 on thomas jefferson enough that it can answer like thomas jefferson well now that gets way better way more data and that you metaverse hook that up can the kid have socrates and confucius and einstein and von neumann and girdle all as tutors yes that's amazing right but also can the kid have real human tutors who are brilliant and care about them because the ai one doesn't care about them or the real human tutors talking to them saying what do you think is different what the ai einstein said versus the real einstein might have said and to be able to really talk with them about that they have to say well what do you think is different between artificial intelligence and organic human intelligence what is intelligence what is what do you think is different about the nature of self-organizing systems versus um design and build systems the recursion on thinking about what is intelligence and organic intelligence and sentience will start to lead those qualities way the up so now the kid gets a level of human tutoring that is the as good as marcus aurelius had but could be distru could be democratized right could everybody could have it because of a new economic system right a level of this ai tutoring thing that nobody ever had and when we go back and look at most of the great polymaths they have this right even all the way down to einstein and von neumann as the last ones had mathematician governances when they were young the remnant of the european system what hope does it bring for me for humanity and the dalai lama's tutoring right like you get somebody like the dalai lama and you have that kind of tutoring system of the very best tibetan monks tutoring you intensely from the time you're tiny if if everybody had that educational system and the goal of education was not to prepare you for the market that the robots and as are doing but was to develop a new what is uniquely human capacities not automatable capacities and then also your unique aptitudes and you have a economic system that can intend you to be able to or support you or it's not even about incent but support you to do what you're intrinsically intended to do deeply and really well trained to do that's really  inspiring and that would these same technologies that portend really terrible dystopias way worse dystopias than ever before because dystopias had a limit of how controlling they could be because the people would revolt ai empowered drone empowered dystopias are really really bad right and ai catastrophes are really bad but ai third attractor empowered which is not disintermediating human intelligence but facilitating it not disintermediating human connection but facilitating and this one of the key things is that all of the tech has to facilitate what is uniquely human rather than to debase or or disintermediated um your online world should be helping your offline world be richer not the other way around online relationships should be enriching offline relationships um anything that's an emergent property of some more fundamental thing needs to be enriching the fundamental thing that it depends upon right that's a general design principle of good tech now this these are a couple examples of like really inspiring tech i can also give examples of how we can use ai to make democracy actually work because you can't fit everybody in a town hall [Music] does the internet make it possible to fit everybody in a town hall and where we can use gpt3 like semantic analysis to be able to get a to see the distribution of everybody's values and stack ranking on everybody's values and to then be able to take all of those values as constraints of proposition crafting and then also help craft propositions that are better synergistic satisfiers with less unnecessary theory of trade-offs totally this is not an ai singleton disintermediating humans this is ai being able to help the scale issue of collective intelligence it's like a high resolution democracy uh could be really powerful we have to build this the third attractor needs this right which is something that is not it it's a decentralized collective intelligence with central enactment capability but where the central enactment capability comes from a bottom-up system that is not capturable not corruptable um so these are a few examples and i could give a heap more in in energy and manufacturing and waste management whatever but these ones around coordination of things that i find really hopeful but that we don't have the incentives to be building them that way yet because we're starting multipolar traps which is why this podcast and stuff like this is important to me is because more people building things like this is really important next part what is inspiring for me about human wha what brings me hope at the level of human nature is important the real politic assessment that humans are just too irrational and just too kind of rivalrous and nasty to be able to make a nice world until we just need an ai singleton or we just need something like that [Music] it's important to understand the real political assessment but it's also total gibberish um in that it doesn't factor development like if you study developmental psych there are higher levels of cognitive capacity higher levels of moral capacity work of kohlberg and you know uh lovinger and things like that and they can be developed across a whole population both by building tech that incentivizes them in economic systems and educational systems and etc and so if you don't factor development you just see a gaussian distribution of violence or rationality or whatever and you don't know what makes up the gaussian distribution well the people on two standard deviations are right and two standard deviations the left are not just distributions of human nature it's there are reasons for that and there are reasons that can be changed in societal structure and the reason we know this is because there are some cultures that are way less violent across the whole culture and some that are way more violent and it doesn't have to do with the distribution of genetics so we can see that the jains are non-violent to humans animals and bugs across the entire huge population across a long period of time and we can see that the janjaweed are extremely violent across the entire population that's culture affecting the expression of human nature human nature can do either of those human nature has radical plasticity so and then um i shared this video a while ago i don't know if you saw it but if not you should link it as well it was a really good explainer video on um the lead additive in gasoline and the effects of lead in the environment because to just make engine stop knocking the fuel companies figured out to add this leaded thing that combusted it and put lead into the atmosphere and it turned out that the effect that has on brains dropped the global iq by about a billion points and made people about 4x more violent and you're like  that's one chemical that's one chemical that we made for internal combustion engines to stop knocking there's like 50 million chemicals in the american chemical database they all do weird stuff um that's not including the xenoestrogens and the ddt and the you know whatever else the that one chemical if we say the real politic assessment is humans are too dumb and nasty and that one chemical made them way dumber and way nastier we're like okay well it's not just humans it's humans under conditioning both physiological effects and psychological effects we can do things that move it in the other direction too and so when i look at the average level of education of the jewish community jewish across a long time of non-violence across the buddhist community it's like this is not a person this is a distribution across an entire population and they didn't even have tech to move it in the right direction if we see how fast facebook can polarize the population with its ai that curates bias doubling on in people what if facebook's algorithm was incentivized to do the opposite thing which was be able to expose people to stuff that would correct for their biases and to connect them to people that expanded their network connectivity the most we would see an enlightenment engine culturally faster than anything the world has ever imagined and so this is where it's like i'm excited about tech builders understanding this more complete picture because we could build tech and not just tech but the combination of tech and the regulation of it and the incentive system and things it could be really profound so i'm inspired by actual human nature and the plasticity and potential of it and the things that the tech can do and with culture and like that so this is answering your question about hope just with a few examples and the last thing i want to say on that is like it's very connected to this idea of like this other quality of faith of like having hope where i don't even know the thing i have hope in yet and i would say without a religious sensibility one can and actually needs to have a particular kind of faith i believe which is and we can say in a really secular way it's easy to say there's no way it can work nope i i see the patterns and we only have this many years it's getting worse like this we're that's assuming and and that kind of certainty can justify us doing some pretty nasty stuff because of utilitarian calculus all right if it's for sure that we're going to um destroy the environment in this period of time my eco-terrorism is a really good idea um if it's sure agi's gonna take over in this period of time my brain chip is a really good idea whatever it is even if it's really bad for other reasons because but we we can't be that certain because the unknown unknown set that could include solutions we don't know we can't even factor how much is in it right and so it's really easy to get false certainty that then justifies really bad actions under utilitarian ethics and so there's a faith that says i don't know what the solution is but i know that the things that i don't know and i'm not even aware that i don't know is a really large infinite set and as a result i'm gonna not just sit back and say oh it'll take care of itself i'm gonna study my ass off and i'm gonna innovate i'm gonna talk to other people i'm gonna work on finding the solutions that might be in those various parts of the unknown unknowns that i don't currently know so there's like a faith in possibility that keeps one actually learning and innovating that also requires a humility on not having the wrong kinds of certainty about catastrophism right so it seems like sort of like studying your ass off and really dedicating to solving the problem but knowing that the solution is likely in the unknown unknown set and having that faith to continue studying the problem without knowing what the goal line is and maybe i know criteria and it's like you know edison was a very very flawed person but that kind of famous conversation when napoleon hill was interviewing him after the light bulb and he said have you uh had you never been able to figure out the light bulb what would you have done and edison said something like young man if i i'd still be in my lab working on it um right after all the philosophies like i was gonna die on the hill trying because i knew that the i had a deep faith [Music] that there was some way to run electricity through a wire in a particular environment that would light up like the the elements were enough that i didn't know what the right answer was but i felt that there was one enough i was going to keep working at it and of course as a slaughter person might have been in other ways innovation does innovation that requires failing a lot requires that kind of faith to keep working at and we need to innovate not just at building a piece of tech but an entire technosphere and social sphere compatible with the biosphere and compatible with human nature it's a deep set of things to innovate on and we can't but it does require that commitment which also requires that kind of face commitment relationship right so um i think it's really refreshing to spend some time on where you spend your hope where you think about hope because these catastrophes and dystrophias are it's really bleak when you're staring into that abyss and so i've got my notes here the tech inspires you human nature inspires you and also your relationship to hope or faith itself so basically starting with the tech you know the example of surveillance tech which allows you to solve for multiple traps by having a neutral adjustator of who's breaking the laws and no more possible deniability of people who are defecting ai enabling tutoring enabling education to be like fractal and create more education uh which creates more anti-fragility and better informed citizens which we could use to plug into higher resolution democracy these are all examples of tech that could be used for the public good but we have this economic problem where we don't have the incentives to solve it um and we see the same sort of thing in the human nature area of of this so you're inspired by actual human nature because because we can upregulate human nature to go from being dumb and mean to being smart and more polite and i think that you said the jewish communities and buddhist communities are maybe an example of that if lead in gasoline or facebook can regulate us down what can upregulate us in in terms of our ability to solve those problems and then lastly hope in faith itself it's easy to say it can't be done but you're not considering the unknown unknowns if you study your ass off and commit yourself to solving these problems then that's the first step in in hope or faith itself um so i don't know like to me that's just it's just nice to to hear someone who's thought as much about this has hope in all of those places because i think that the seeds of our next episode are going to be exploring how do we combine the opportunities and technology with um actual incentives to solve public goods problems commons problems multi-polar traps and maybe attempt to start addressing the meta crisis is i think where we want to take this series of podcasts that we're doing together i love the way you recap things uh it's really really fun and yes and i would only add one more thing to this is um your community knows a lot about red teaming because you're doing crypto security stuff and so you'll build a thing and then red team it i there's a in the age-old dialogue between optimism and pessimism i think about a commitment to optimism that's attached to solutions in the unknown unknowns with pessimism retaining specific propositions yeah an internal kind of autodidactic process as well as a group process an intergroup process that should happen so i want to see people commit to bring solutions about even though they don't know how there's a famous thing with gandhi when he first went to south africa and saw the um kind of slavery and racial issue there and then when he went to india again of that he's like this is unacceptable i'm going to solve it and his friends are like how he goes i don't know but i'm committing to solve it before i know how and then i'm going to just sit here and think and meditate and write and come up with ideas until i know what to do but i'm not going to do other than think about what to do because i've already committed what does it mean to commit to something you don't yet know how to do right um so that's a kind of optimism that says there there's something in the unknown unknown set that can solve this and i have to solve it because i feel morally obligated to solve this like it's not okay with my being to not be part of the solution to this thing that i see and i'll i'll die on this hill if i have to right like i yeah if i'm working towards and whether my being is calling me to protect the amazon or factory farms or coordination itself whatever it is with my i have to do that dharmically um being committed even though you don't know how which means you will keep figuring out how when it fails you'll find another way rather than just give up is both what's most likely to make you succeed and where you can be most at peace if you fail and die right in the process because you're like i i was given if if i'm gonna fail i want to do it this way right i want to have been aligned in this way in the process but i don't want to fail stupidly i don't want to fail from i could have figured out so i want to red team my own ideas and that's a kind of pessimism but it's a pessimism in service of effective optimism my optimism says i'm committed to find a solution my pessimism said i bet that solution is a problem right not to make me give up but to say oh you're right that one does have a problem rather than wait till it just fails in the world after a lot of money in a lot of years how about let me just red team it really hard right now let me ask all my smart friends what's wrong with it then when they give me what's wrong with it i'm not going to give up i'm going to be like all right those are new constraints to a design problem let me keep working on a new design then i try it again and eventually you get something that's hardened now if you're like this is not perfect but this is adequate to move the thing forward and so so there there's a relationship between these two where the optimism is only realizable because it's hardened by pessimism and the pessimism is in service to the optimism and this also reconciles a parts conflict in our self where those two parts are actually in service to each other right relationship good it's almost like using adversarial thinking in order to get to a world in in in which these things are not not a problem anymore um to general optimism and pessimism of the red team red teaming specific solutions and in general what i'd like to say is for any of your you know anyone in the community working on a crypto solution you're like okay this will be good because it will decentralize this thing that is currently centralizing corrupt ask all your friends to red team where the externalities will be and why it's a bad idea oh this is centralized because it's really important to be centralized for these reasons decentralizing it leads to these coordination failures or whatever it is or being so much slower that another centralized one that's worse takes over or whatever it is don't be afraid to hear that like speed up the rate at which you hear why your good idea is a bad idea because you think it's a good idea because there's something that it's addressing that's really important awesome because it's important you want to hear where it's going to fail or where it would cause problems somewhere else that you really don't want to cause this problem somewhere else so that you can internalize that into a more robust and more inclusive design so i don't want people just red teaming from a cryptography perspective i want people teaming from a is this actually a good idea and is this causing problems somewhere else perspective and then to not give up but to design better so uh now that we've stuck the landing uh maybe we can do a quick recap of the broader series that we're going to do together so this was episode one which is what is the meta crisis the next episode we're going to talk about considerations of governance of systems that can solve the meta crisis and then we're gonna red team some web three uh proposed solutions to address the meta crisis in the remaining episodes for aiming between two and in four episodes between this series did i get that mostly right yep let's just not call it solve the metacrisis that's right a web three can help address the the meta crisis right one thing i would offer we were talking about this earlier is um it becomes clear pretty quickly that economy and gov and governance economics and governance are fused you can't separate them because yeah governance issues mostly have to do with allocation of resources and allocation of resource issues end up requiring things like uh law and adjudication of how that stuff works um so you end up getting into the topic of what's usually called political economy right the political economy is the idea of how does an economic and governance system work together within infrastructure and culture i would really like to encourage people in the web3 space who are coming from being technologists and builders to study political economy more because really smart people put a lot of time into a lot of nuanced stuff that you don't want to re try to reinvent the wheel and reinvent the wheel and realize failures on we want to see how having new technological capacities makes new things possible but we want to understand the design constraints that have come about so far from very very harder and hard-won processes you and i were mentioning um richard haas the president of council foreign relations example of uh someone thinking about international relations and political economy and how the current world system works in a very nuanced detailed way that i would love if people like him were being studied but that work was being studied by crypto people more and he's he had a famous paper where he said talked about the difference between problems and predicaments and that a problem admits a complete solution a predicament requires ongoing management um a predicament could also be called a wicked problem um but anytime you have different interests that are competing with each other or you have trade-offs where those who care about one side will keep pushing for those you know on a solution to move more in that direction then you don't end up getting a perfect solution you get an ongoing management issue and so the metacrisis does not admit a solution it admits hopefully progressively more competent so partial solutions and management and addressing and for people who are used to thinking about tech where you can define the problem in a fairly narrow way and admit a full solution this piece of code compiles and does this thing that's mostly not how human and cultural and organic systems work so um we we want to get out of solutions and into managing ongoing complexity maturely responsibly effectively beautiful i think that's a a taste tasty teaser for the episode that we're going to do next about uh political theory what there is to learn from it and governance that can solve the meta crisis daniel thank you for taking the time to record this episode with us i really deeply genuinely believe that there's a ton of upside for political thinkers like you systemic risk thinkers like you to combine with people in the web three endow community to uh design economies that favor the commons and help solve multiple traps and i hope that uh i hope that else putting this out there into the universe creates that attractor for people who want to solve that problem together like you said more more ears more eyeballs equals more people thinking about this equals more hope for me so um i really appreciate you setting this out the time yeah i do too and um i know a lot of people i think are really brilliant thinkers in the kind of web 3 dow decentralized governance space some who you should have on your show that know a heap more about this space specifically than i do maton fields would be good i don't know if you've had trach um jordan hall um vera some of the folks at holochain i think they're all really good thinkers um like arthur brock and uh fernanda but um of the people who i have spoken with you are so clearly earnestly motivated to really solve collective action problems and coordination problems and have figured out how to be pretty central to an ecosystem of people really trying to do that uh that's why i wanted to come to this dialogue series with you because obviously a lot of people can say they're trying to do that while really trying to drive the bubble on a speculative token and i am inspired by what can happen because the people who understand political economy well are mostly not trying to really innovate fundamentally new models some are but it you know seems like okay at best we can do tiny incremental advancement and i know the web three spaces might be almost the only space one of the only spaces really thinking about can we do fundamental ground up redesign which is why i wanted to understand everything that's happened before and think about redesign and i really like uh yeah where your community's positioned so i'm happy to be here talking with you yeah well gitcoin's mission is to build and fund the the the public good and that is a multi-polar trap in global coordination failure so it's it's at the heart of of what we're trying to do um and i think that we're committed to solving the problem but we haven't figured out exactly how so i can relate to you in in in that way um [Music] yeah so i think that's all there is to say thanks again for being on the on the show daniel wonderful talk with you my friends [Music] you
