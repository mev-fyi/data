or falling behind at a rapid rate that's actually basically compounding to us losing or being a losing path against other nations or regions that that are are making really solid progress welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless on today's episode we have a postmortem of Facebook's highly ambitious project all the way back from 2019 Facebook at that time trying to build a stable coin but the US government stopped it from white paper to being called in front of Congress in three weeks what really happened and what can we learn and apply about crypto there's two Davids on the show today we are guiding this conversation today by David Marcus and of course my co-host David Hoffman but David Marcus is one of the architects of Facebook's stablecoin project a few things we get into today number one Facebook's Libra project why did it fail and who tanked it the US government the banking Lobby and why can't the West seem to innovate on its banking system number two we talk about super apps and why David doesn't think they work including Musk most recent attempt with Twitter AKA X lastly we talk about why our guest thinks the money layer of the internet will be built on crypto but not just crypto that will be built more specifically on bitcoin yup and this is where the episode takes a turn into debate territory no we didn't get into the full debate with David on ethereum versus Bitcoin you'll have to tune into the debrief for that David why was this episode significant to you this episode threads a number of different subjects that I think are going to be increasingly relevant for the crypto industry one is payments of course we know payments but also social Messengers why do Messengers and payments go together and then what does the government have to say about that is the third variable I think understanding the incentives from each variable payments messenger and government regulation I think understanding each one independently inside of its own style level and it will help kind of carve out the path for where this ultimately goes for what will hopefully ultimately become crypto native payment applications messenger applications that don't exist yet but I think if you listen to this episode you'll kind of understand that these things are probably going to come together and also the government's going to have something to say about it so I think these are the themes to pay attention to and why this episode is significant I know it was killing you David not to have the Bitcoin versus ethereum debate but I really had to like plug myself yeah I saw you I saw you but the spice will flow in the debrief of course which is available of course for bankless Citizens now on the premium RSS feed click the link in the show notes if you

Tech executive in the world of payments we're really interested in this lens on where all this stuff is going and I think the discussion today is much broader than just payments so I first ran across David in 2019 and this was the year he testified in front of Congress on behalf of Facebook in support of this project called diem I'm sure many bankless listeners remember DM it was also called Libra for a time this was Facebook's attempt at a stable coin the US government maybe shut it down uh I'm not sure what happened maybe we'll hear more from David today and before all this he started a company that was acquired by PayPal he later became the president at PayPal that means running the company and then he joined Facebook as the VP of their messenger app and that's when he started the Libra project and right now he is a co-founder of Light spark a company that is building out bitcoin's lightning technology and this intersection of web 2 government crypto that's what we have on the docket to talk about today David welcome to banglas thank you and good morning good morning uh wow I'm I'm hyped to actually have this conversation with you because uh you you came across my radar back in 2019 with the Facebook Libra DM project and I think that's actually a logical place to start if we're gonna unravel the future of payments and and how the government in crypto and big Tech is involved so let's start is a case study can we first talk about the Libra project David so uh can you give us some context and then we'll talk about maybe what went wrong or what the roadblocks um you know that that appeared actually were so what is this project for those who weren't familiar with it at the time so Libra I like to call it Libra I feel like DM was not really its real name but it it ended up uh it ended up there but uh so look what we tried to do then was actually to try to bring to the world an open protocol for payments or money on the internet which is still lacking as we speak today which is kind of an anomaly and a shame uh but basically what we try to do is build really good tech for real-time uh net settlement of money on the internet and um and and one of the artifacts that was actually needed at the time to make it it happen we at least we thought so was actually a stable coin so the whole package was actually a technology a blockchain that was basically the Libra blockchain uh a smart contracts programming language which uh was moved that's still alive today uh in uh in different forms and on on high performance layer ones out there uh and uh and a stable coin and uh and basically the thesis was if we're doing it from Facebook but then all of our control and our governance over it then we can actually really have a positive impact uh in the world uh unfortunately no one actually believed the power uh you know power dynamics behind it and uh and a brand association with Facebook at the time was just not palatable from a political standpoint so yes you were right in your intro uh the project was killed or shut down by uh by the government that's so interesting so there's some details there to to Really unpack maybe you could start us with this so what was in it for Facebook like why did Facebook even want to go down this uh this this project Endeavor well I think that you know if you think about Facebook and the role the company has played over over many many uh years uh on all kinds of different contributions that have changed uh the direction of travel of Technology um you know more recently on AI or even in VR uh you can see that there's a pattern there of trying to bring breakthrough Technologies then bring it to the masses and try to really help with the distribution it has to advance all kinds of different problems that uh that people have had and again like you know right now very successfully so with with AI contributions to open source and and others it feels like there's also a tie with kind of messaging and I believe you were um you're part of kind of the the Facebook Messenger group as well and we certainly see this pattern playing out in you know China super apps you know Japanese super apps the the wechats of the world the Ali pays of the world is this kind of part of the Inception of the idea here's what China is doing some of the Chinese tech companies and so if we just take messaging and we add the ability for an individual user to actually not just send um communication messages but to send money then we've got a kind of a killer app combo and this begins to look almost like a like a super app is that part of the thesis here so definitely not the I mean so I think China is a you know in a totally different world because like it actually LeapFrog credit cards to go straight from messaging based payments in WeChat and others uh and I I don't think that's actually applicable to the West at all because we've have have like you know credit cards and modern uh modern payments experiences despite the fact that they're not built on Modern rails uh for a very long time uh but yes when when I left PayPal so I was leading PayPal I came to Facebook to actually build the messenger product or you know build it into a a standalone product when uh when I joined one of the first things I did was actually try to add payments to it um and you know this is uh this is a a a a product that enables people to move money inside of messenger in the US right now not globally um and as you know WhatsApp is also part of uh of meta now and so the thought was definitely to try to enable Global Payments inside of those platforms to enable people to actually move sound digital money around the world in a really seamless and and cost-effective way because we thought it would actually solve real world problems at scale and really unlock a lot of value so there was definitely a distribution play on the mess messaging apps but not only on the messaging apps of meta that was actually super relevant at the time to us so Facebook has this idea um they want to like you know Facebook wants to create kind of a payments application inside of its messenger app and so the idea behind Libra is kind of born we can use some smart blockchain Tech combine that with you know smart contracts uh we'll probably need a stable coin for this sort of thing then what has to happen so can you can you bring us forward to 2019 so does a company like Facebook have to like go ask for government permission in order to do this or like how does it work because here in crypto we just like release code you know like we publish it on GitHub and then people you know run it on their nodes and it just kind of like we no one no you know Satoshi didn't go in front of Congress and ask uh for anyone's permission but but tell tell us how this works in inside of a corporate environment so look I mean when when you work um uh when you build a project like this uh at the at the center of a company that reaches at a time 3.5 billion uh monthly active users uh and is as as at the center of public policy for all kinds of different uh topics um you can't just uh launch something like this and and hope for the best so there were a lot of rumors uh when uh we were building uh Libra and the rumors were actually a lot worse than the reality at the time and so we felt like you know we had everything ready so we're just going to issue a white paper that that describes what our intentions are what the technology is and where we're going with it and um and you know with that bring more people along for the journey but also engage with Regulators all around the world and talking about the the things that we didn't think through in terms of compliance and you know regulatory requirements uh we thought of a lot of them but you know different countries have different requirements and and different approaches to this so we felt it was going to be an open conversation uh and a conversation it uh it was immediately actually uh I think you know we published a white paper on I think June 18 of 2019 if I'm not mistaken and I was testifying in front of Congress maybe three weeks later uh and so that uh that was a pretty pretty uh rapid response uh wow three weeks later from white paper to in front of Congress it's gonna be a record I think that's a that's a record that will probably not be beaten by anyone um but uh yeah it's uh that's what happened unpacking how you ended up in front of Congress so quickly I think is uh worth worthwhile and I want to do that but I actually want to start by talking about the intersection between messaging and payments uh as someone who is intimately familiar with both maybe you can articulate the vision as to why these things fit so well together so I think when people realize like oh Facebook is doing a blockchain there was a big there was like reverberations throughout the crypto industry but maybe you can articulate the the most bullish vision for why payments and messaging just pair so well together yeah sure and and let me break that question and and and and two and a two-part answer so like the first part is actually messaging is a great place for payments because typically when you pay someone you have to have a conversation about that payment or you have to you know someone has to ask you for money for you to actually send them the money um and so having a messaging app where you have a conversation where you know who you're talking to and enabled that thread with transactional capabilities actually fits really really well with the the objective that two people in a conversation or even a group of people in a in a group chat uh have uh have for for a payment so um so that's why it fits so well um and then the the the other part is actually you know how do you um how do you take this and and make it available to hundreds of millions if not billions of people um actually interestingly enough in early 2018 we went to see lightning Labs team in SF and we looked at lightning as one of the ways to actually do this um and uh and unfortunately the tech just wasn't ready for prime time and certainly not for scaling to uh the type of scale that uh that meta had with uh with its messaging apps and so we felt that at the time the only way that we could actually make this work from a scalability and and finality times and all these things uh standpoint we had to actually go build new tech and that's what we did so when three weeks later after releasing the white paper you end up in front of Congress was that expected did you see that coming or like what was the expected response to the uh the release of the DM project yeah so I mean I definitely expected uh both enthusiasm and a lot of pushback and certainly we had both um and I I honestly felt like um my expectation was actually that we would get a lot more pushback in Europe and other regions than in the US uh just because it was kind of a U.S centered like or started product a product or or project um and it turned out that you know the US was the most conservative um in that sense and uh and the most aggressive in uh in dragging me in front of Congress uh in the early days of uh of the project yeah why do you think that is what's the motivation for them to have been so conservative around this project I mean I think there was a lot of political uh influence there uh in the sense that you know um they just didn't want Facebook in the middle of uh of money uh just generally speaking um and uh the the reach of the company with its core products was just something that that scared a lot of uh lawmakers basically at the time my interpretation of that answer is that uh Facebook with the social network that it has come combined with a payments Network also combined with its own currency which is what this was really started to infiltrate into the business model of the government that's my interpretation of that maybe I'll leave that interpretation to to you but uh but I feel like look I mean and and by the way it wasn't even our own currency it was really uh a a stable coin that had by all of you know today's uh stablecoin standards a lot more distributed governance um and uh and and decision making than uh than any of of the other ones out there right now uh if you remember we had like 28 uh Libra members uh who were part of a Consortium that was behind this and uh and everyone had an equal vote in the direction of travel of the project including its stable coin so you know I think you know it served as a as a blueprint for a lot of projects that came after which is good uh and uh and you know I think that it was uh it was a fascinating and intellectually stimulating and challenging experience so I don't regret any minute of it but it was worth a shot and uh and now uh you know we're we're trying to do something uh on on the Bitcoin blockchain using lightning um for the purpose of trying to bring an open payment protocol for the internet so still very stubbornly focused and trying to fix that problem for the world so full circle and we'll certainly get to uh what you're up to yeah I'm just wondering on kind of never having been summoned in front of Congress like just on a human level like what's that like I mean are you is is it nerve-wracking to just be brought in those you know Congressional halls and you know to face various lawmakers and to be on the hot seat for uh whatever they want to ask and whatever ever a political point they want to score uh yeah what what's that like what was your experience of it overall well look I mean for me the the first part of it was actually um you know I'm I'm an immigrant and an American by choice and so for me there was a a part of it which was actually okay you know this is actually an honor that I guess to go and defend a project that I really deeply care about in front of uh uh you know our our highest uh Authority or chambers of of of legislature uh in our country so uh and you know that was particularly true in the Senate room which is a very impressive room with you know marble adorned walls and uh and a big seal of the Senate um and you know there there are different modes of uh of testimonies and you know when you're the single witness uh the entire attention of everyone is on you versus like a panel of experts testifying in front of Congress so I had the honor of having uh that single witness uh testimony mode and of course it's intimidating and you need to you're representing a project that's much bigger than you and a company that's much bigger than you and so a lot of a lot of pressure is on uh for you to do the best job you can do to defend the project that you're passionate about my feeling on the arguments is one of the strongest arguments you know I believe in in general proponents put forward but um also still crypto really puts forward today is um US Government aren't you interested in exporting the US Dollar on top of like crypto rails or open internet standards uh and if you don't do this then go look at what some of your nation state level competitors are doing namely China because they have a an export uh strategy for their digital currency and they are very aggressive both domestically they've got that whole system set up I mean we mentioned alipay and WeChat the system seems to work fairly well from a technology perspective and they're aggressively trying to export all of that to the world and so Congress if you don't wake up and let us do it or some American company do it uh then you're seeding this position over to your competitors that to me was the most Salient case now you can you can put aside for a second maybe we'll come back to this whether uh the US government was was comfortable with big Tech uh you know being being the the the carrier of of that burden but that case in and of itself it seems like the US is still not jumped uh and snapped up which is why aren't you interested in exporting the Dollar on Digital internet rails um why didn't that why did that land or did it land in in some small Pockets what's your take on that so I mean this is something I'm really super passionate and can get really worked up about um but um you know I I feel like I'm I'm a fairly patriotic guy and I feel like I want the us to win at technologies that are going to be changing the course of uh of the the equilibrium of power uh in uh in you know a hundred year timeline right and I I definitely feel that the entire crypto industry and new payment rails and all that is definitely one of those strategic things that we absolutely cannot afford to lose and and you know currently uh as far as you know the the regulatory uh world uh out there and the Arbitrage happening um the fact that we don't have the clarity we need to operate um and the fact that you know we're we're really not competitive I think today uh the first Bitcoin ETF was launched in Europe uh and you know we're still turning down all of the ETF applications out there that would actually enable a lot many more people to have access to digital assets and in this case Bitcoin um and so I feel like you know we're falling behind at a rapid rate that's actually uh basically compounding to us um losing or being a losing path uh against um other nations or regions that uh that are are making really solid progress on a core technology that is actually I feel that I mean the problem is also that you know we as an industry have done a fairly poor job at explaining the real world problems that the technology solves and how it it's actually becoming essential that you know people are are empowered with real-time digital sound transactions that are Global in nature that are interoperable I mean if there's an internet of money that happens tomorrow and we're not you know part of the discussion or we're not you know even part of being in the driving seat uh then you know we would come to regret it and I think that you know that's uh that's a perspective problem that we've had as a country um and uh and yeah we're falling behind I think that if you're looking at what's happening now even in Hong Kong where China has kind of changed their world view in terms of what's permissible in Hong Kong as a reaction to Singapore basically dragging in the best talent to come and build crypto companies and and new technologies um you can see the world changing in Europe the same deal or in the UK now uh the the those governments are trying to attract the world's best talents to come and go build there and we're basically turning everyone away yeah I mean so put aside any beef the US government might have with with Facebook or it's a business model but this basic idea and this this is why it's it's still very perplexing to me David I'm wondering if you could shed some light on you know whether there's any underlying power structures behind this but um the US you know in the in the 1990s was um very supportive very Innovative with respect to the early internet this open Communications standard and that's how we got Silicon Valley right the US dollar dollar is also the world's leading Reserve currency so the US already has two major wins under its belt it has Silicon Valley and the success of the internet what did we do during the 90s we basically just let the internet be the internet we put up some sensible regulation in place uh we we supported our our tech companies and then that's we got what we got today I mean American entrepreneurs just brought us to this place that that's a Playbook that's worked we also have the dollars we have the most to lose if the US doesn't stay ahead of the curve so why is it so different with like money over the Internet like why is there such a different posture and I'm wondering here if you think that's because there's a different Power structure so the internet really didn't have um a power structure in DC that it was competing with and I wonder if maybe money has a power structure that's competing with you're you're on a a podcast entitled bankless it was pretty clear kind of what our thesis is is that there are a lot of banks out there with um some uh you know interesting power structures and definitely some ties into government in DC do you think effectively it's kind of like the banking Lobby I mean if JP Morgan are a major Bank came with uh you know the similar strategy as as Libra would they have been let in the door what's your overall take on this well so first of all you're right that anything that touches money is different um I mean there's definitely that there's there's no technological reason uh for us globally being in the SAT State we're in of how money moves today the correspondent banking system the the fact that this is basically a messaging system uh that transits through many banking institutions with the batch settlements uh later uh in 2023 is ridiculous I mean you you could actually argue that you know structurally it's kind of shocking that everything that we could have converted into zeros and ones and that are moving on the internet the way that is moving uh is moving the way it is and that the only thing that is not actually digitalized at scale and moves on the internet the way that everything else is is money right so there there's no technical a reason for that it's a structural reason and so yes you're you're right that there's um there's definitely a need or perception of a need of a lot more control uh when it comes to money and there are ways to actually Grant governments control over these things but I feel like the the status quo is something that generally speaking has served uh you know the establishment at large really well uh and um and uh and yeah there's hasn't been any change I mean if you look at the underlying payment uh networks um of Swift ACH uh and uh and the and the likes um and even like you know the the very successful arguably the most successful fintechs of all times like the Visas uh of the world uh all of these things are innovations that happen in the late 60s to 70s right and um and you know those are are for the most part the the networks and the underlying technologies that we're all dependent on for for Global Payments so so yes there's definitely uh other power structures and incentives uh that are at play here than just uh just the technology that a bunch of companies could actually come up with and and and and basically unlock trillions of dollars of payments that are currently not happening today uh because of the limitations of our aging rails I'm share fed now we'll fix all of this and maybe uh fed now 2040 will actually add smart contracts or something like this um it's a I mean we can talk about that by the way I think fednow is actually a really good progress um but it's going to help banking institutions move money faster for for them or between them um and it's a U.S solution it's not a global solution and so in Europe you have seppa and like a bunch of other countries you have different and and those systems are not interconnected with one another they're not communicating with one another and so you know the internet would not have delivered the incredible amount of value that it has if it wasn't a global open network that enabled everyone to access it and build on top of it right right I mean fed now is basically like a um private American you know blockchain like it's not really a blockchain but Network for American Banks you know that's all it's very different than an open permission this is progress address I I'm wondering if you think it's as simple as this so we had somebody by the name of Richard Turin on the podcast uh it's been a while actually he wrote a book called cashless kind of um it was my first kind of uh learning episode in terms of what China is doing with um their you know digital currency and his take was basically this in the US we've decided uh that tech companies and banks have to be separate and they can't you know become one and so we have a tech industry and we have a banking industry and our government gets very uncomfortable when these things start merging together in China you know the banks didn't want to the tech companies to come eat their lunch the Chinese government just said Matt we don't care what you want um you know best solution wins and of course tech companies are much better at uh you know creating Technologies and apps and solutions that actually scale and work and so what we have is the result of we have alipay and we have WeChat and they've in the bank's uh lunch basically so it's back to your point of this being kind of structural in the US we've decided that our banks and tech companies should be separate at least up to this point in China they didn't as a result China has a more Advanced Digital uh money system and digital payment system is that an overly simplistic take uh I think I think there's more Nuance than that I think that you know in China the the there's no problem of government control uh of different sectors of the industry or separate companies right they virtually control all of them um I think that in the U.S uh the it's a little different right our top Banks uh have been regulated to the Wazoo uh after the 08 crisis right and so it's de facto um you know those big banks are de facto you know under the control and purview of the government um and so as such it's uh it's kind of an interesting world where that level of guarantee of control is making a lot of people very comfortable that this is basically a group of entities um that uh that should be allowed to do a bunch of different things under strict regulatory oversight and that you know if you have new entrants that are trying to do new things things and that are big new entrants with a lot of scale that you know they they should be under a lot of scrutiny uh because of the risks that uh you know this might might pause I think you know if you would talk to a lot of the lawmakers that are on this side that's you know basically their world view that they have a bunch of really regulated entities out there that they can really control um and that you know within the bounds of uh of that regulatory framework they should be able to do things and then other new entrants basically the same the same rights because they just don't have that same level of uh of oversight or regulatory authority over them so David I'm getting the sense that there's a lot of variables about how the United States Financial system and our regulatory system and our technology arm there's each one is presents its own variable and I think in in 2023 there's a void that has been created as a result of all of these things like the United States government is like hey Silicon Valley don't touch the banks these things don't touch you know can't cross this line and then the banks get regulated regulated by Dodd-Frank and all the post-08 crisis stuff and then and then we also have this the Petro dollar which is a variable here and I'm wondering if just like what void is left because of maybe because of Regulation but it seems to be that crypto in especially inside the United States is trying to fill this void and I'm wondering if you can help try and Define the actual shape of this void and why it's here and and why isn't it being filled by the rest of the non-crypto part of the United States so does the question make sense yeah totally cool um well look I think there's definitely a definite lack of competition right now that's hurting the most vulnerable people uh globally just not only in the US but also in the US I think you know when we started the Journey of Libra we went and talked to a lot of people who were actually unbanked and asked them you know whether they I mean why were they unbanked actually and whether the problem was actually that they just couldn't afford banking or was it something different and invariably uh and by the way we talked to these people when they were at a cash checkout points you know and those money transfers locations where they would pay 10 to cash a payroll check right and basically they would say that they would prefer paying a 10 fee to um those uh cash checkout points uh rather than have fees levied on their bank accounts at the time they could afford it the least and in unpredictable ways and so and and basically they decided to be unbanked into Cash economy because of the predictability uh and them being in in the driver's seat of when they're actually going to pay a fee for a service that they are accepting the full cost of right um and and basically so you have a lot of people that are left behind I think at the time it was nearly seven or eight million households uh in the US that were uh completely uh off of the banking rails which is you know pretty staggering rate if you think that all of them should be able to afford a simple basic account that would enable them to actually move money in a in a seamless way in a digital way right so um so yeah a lot of people are left behind I also think that a lot of transactions and a lot of money movements um that you know could happen globally and domestically are not happening because of the structural inherent costs of the rails or or the current pricing models that that are out there and uh and that basically traps a lot of value and GDP so to speak um inside of uh of the constraints of the current system um and and and that's just because there's just no competition or very little competition uh and the competition is really on the margin for the very few bips here and there uh targeted typically to merchants or to larger institutions and uh and actually there are lots of really good uh crypto answers to that I mean lero was definitely one proposal of how you would do that with a very very low cost Global uh payment protocol on the internet that would enable anyone to actually move money around I like this answer because it um I hear it subdivided into two different parts there is the just the fees that people are taking to the face just because that is what they will accept in order to participate in the finance system at all but then the other half the answer I think is actually I think is slightly more interesting just because it's a little bit more emergent as in just like the way that our current payment networks are built inside of America there is a constraint on the way that payments are expressed in the economy because they're confined by a regulation the banking sector and the lack of ability of being inside of Silicon Valley inside of fintech and so there's a lot of just like unknown ways in which economic activity could manifest if our payment networks were actually able to support and enable this kind of economic activity but what I think what you're saying is that they're not simply due to the constraints of a the form factor or B the regulation and so we actually don't know how much GDP is latent inside of the United States economy simply just because we don't actually have the payment form factors that can unlock them yeah that's correct yes that's well even better said than I did but yes that's what I meant part of the thing that that drives me crazy and I think many mean you know listening in crypto crazy is that it feels like the US government and I'm speaking broad Strokes as an apparatus like kind of the bureaucrats in Washington don't get it but honestly the bureaucrats in Washington don't seem to get this I mean that the current U.S financial system money system kind of sucks like it really does all right we pay three percent on our payment transactions okay why I mean God bless Visa but like and you mentioned uh you know China kind of skipping the credit card phase and going straight to you know digital they pay like just 20 bips per transaction yeah even less I still have a checkbook David okay I still have a checkbook why because some of the bills that I pay actually don't take digital payments which basically which by the way a checkbook is basically your your private key on a piece of paper that you give to everyone by the way it's absolutely insane meanwhile um you know I look at kind of the the wechats is it's all QR codes this is just like that's the way it should be completely digital completely QR codes just feels like um the US isn't acknowledging the neither the banking sector nor kind of you know the U.S bureaucrats are actually acknowledging how bad the banking system sucks and that frustrates me and I think that is why we're seeing adoption in crypto it's just because this is an open alternative that um people can use to bypass the existing crappy system that we seemingly have to live with uh you're nodding your head so I you know I'm guessing you agree with this no I mean I feel like look people um people want solutions to their problems and so you know when presented there's actually let's move out of the US for a good good measure in terms of giving more Salient examples um if you look at Argentina or if you look at Venezuela or if you look at countries where clearly the central bank and the government has devalued currency had um you know monetary policy that led to hyperinflation to the point where basically your money that's in your pocket is burning a hole in your pocket by the time you can actually spend it so you you get your payroll you get like a wad of cash and you run to spend it immediately because anything that you can buy is actually going to hold value more than the banknotes you have in your pocket right and if you look at what happens in these countries in these countries you have a lot more crypto adoption because people are are looking to actually have a fair store of value for the legal hard labor that they performed and that they deserve to keep the value of right and so they go and figure out Solutions into to your point crypto Bitcoin stable coins in this case and different wallets are a solution to a real world problem that in this case is actually you know super you know life life threatening for for all of these people because they just can't afford to make ends meet and and to put food on the table of their families if they don't do that then crypto is an answer for for these people uh and so that's kind of the more extreme uh world uh that uh that that exists outside of the US where they they don't have the benefit of having sound good money uh which arguably the US dollar really still is compared to all of these currencies out there well said and I completely agree I you know another potential solution for this though is that another tech company like a meta like a Facebook stands up and says no we'll fix this we will actually build the super app we'll combine kind of the messaging and we'll combine the money and we can do it um I think recently it's been interesting to me uh post Elon musk's acquisition you know and running of Twitter uh some of his um product direction of turning Twitter into a super app and I'm not sure exactly what super app entails but for me most basically it entails kind of Social and kind of like Finance money it's both of those things together at least if you're going to compete like the Chinese super apps do that that feels like a working definition of super app to me um let me ask you David do you think that something like Twitter X I guess we should call it now is going to be successful on this type of super app Endeavor or will they face the same roadblock blocks that that Facebook did I mean I think we'll see uh and I think it'll depend on what they decide to go uh tackle and how um it's back to um to my previous comment around you know the the fact that you know if you're it's a it's a question of control and oversight right so if you're building really you know new payment um experiences on top of the existing rails then it's probably fine if you're trying to bring in new more efficient more open rails uh then it's a lot more complicated especially if you're a tech company that has a lot of uh distribution um and so you know one of the reasons we decided to actually go build on top of Bitcoin is because it's already live it's open uh it's censorship resistant uh it's a neutral internet money um and uh and we believe that you know if there's anything that's actually going to uh withstands the the the various uh tensions and pressures uh it's going to be something that's open not controlled by any one entity one person not having one person that has an outside voice in the direction of the protocol or the community um and uh and that's why we decided to build on top of Bitcoin and build it on Lightning because we believe that you know that's basically the only thing that will withstand that kind of pressure so if you're looking at it from the the network side um that's uh that's the key thing it's like really can you make something that actually really looks and behaves like the internet right now uh be an efficient uh way for people to move value around and and and and again I think that if you're just like on the front end and you're just putting a nice app uh that enables people to do something on existing rails then you know that's uh that's a completely different thing are you a metamask user well you're

conclusion like an inevitability I'm not sure if that's a whole I'm not sure by the way I you know I maybe maybe we can we can poke into that but say let's say we let's take this on faith that just like the the Chinese uh Eastern model of just like put everything into one single app and grow its Network effects is like a logical conclusion of apps and say that you know inevitably in the West in America we will find a way to get there would you say that the window of opportunity is closed for a western um super app to exist that also uses fintech for its payments so like if we're going to get a super app in the west it's gonna it's gonna have to be built on top of a more disruptive non non-us native payment rails like Bitcoin like crypto for example like do something like DM rather than just like building on top of venmo or PayPal or VISA would you would you agree with that statement so first of all let me let me just um be the the the less enthusiastic uh person for super apps in the west sure um again I think that you know the what what we've seen in China is really specific to um China the problem China basically before uh WeChat became a giant super app that enabled them to do uh all the things that it enables them to do uh was mainly uh a cash economy yeah and you know there was very little to no credit card penetration uh there were no real efficient ways for people to move money around uh and uh and you know as we discussed earlier if you're in the middle of a conversation um that's a really good place to initiate payments uh and so it leapfrogged to becoming a super app and because it had like payment capabilities then you could build all kinds of Commerce applications that actually lived inside of the same app um I think structurally in the west and in the US we're in a very very different place and that's why I'm not sure um that super apps will ever become a thing in the US right I think that we go as consumers to different apps for different use cases and uh different apps have a job to be done for us um and I think that breaking that Paradigm when uh there's no significant better way of doing things within a super app is just not going to happen um so but but you know that that's still it doesn't answer the problem of okay how do you actually enable people to move value between those apps between consumers and those apps between these Services uh in a more seamless effective way at a subatomic unit of a currency that you can't move today uh and and in a global way which you know certainly cannot happen today so I think those are more exciting problems to work on um and yes for those problems you definitely need new capabilities new rails new open interoperable rails uh that are currently not uh adopted or or I mean there's no winning protocol for money on the internet at this point so we've talked a lot so far David about um you know big government the US Western governments we've talked a lot about kind of tech companies as well and we've just hinted at at crypto and what crypto can do in this whole Space now now I think we want to turn conversation to to crypto so what role does crypto really play and uh what specifically are you building at light spark like um what open standard are you building on top of and what are you hoping to achieve so yeah let me start with the the the latter part of of your question I feel like so what we're building at lightspark is basically tools and software to uh facilitate or accelerate the adoption of the lightning Network as an open protocol for payments on the internet that would enable all of the things that we discussed earlier uh very cheap low-cost interoperable open payments on the internet um in a very native way to the internet uh and um and we picked lightning because we believe um as I hinted at earlier that the underlying Network that can transport this money can only be a network that you know is basically behaving like the intranet and that's not really controlled by any one entity or group of companies or uh or where a single person has an outsized uh voice and when you look at it that way the only Network that actually fits the bill the only asset that also fits the bill is Bitcoin um and it's way harder to build on top of it than you know building uh on evm but uh it's uh it's worth it for that specific use case I think for other use cases evm is a lot better and building on ethereum is a lot better um but for the case of uh true neutral censorship resistant internet of money um or money of the internet like native digital money for the internet Bitcoin is really the only uh the only show in town um so that's that's why we're building it on top of it uh and um and so lightning is a channel based payment system which is very unintuitive um because typically we're not used to locking liquidity and channels rebalancing those channels finding routes through channels of third parties to actually find a destination in a really efficient way and uh and that's what we've been working on trying to make basically lightning behave uh exactly like you would come to expect from an Enterprise standpoint where not a consumer-facing company we're just building tools that will enable large-scale and smaller scale companies to send and receive value natively on the internet uh in a predictable reliable easy way I'm wondering was there a um cost benefit analysis between choosing to use lightning Network versus something like stable coins I know you put a ton of emphasis on like you know shared open standard no company behind the the currency et cetera um but there's been a pretty clear uh division between payments in crypto between Bitcoin and stable coins where stable coins are just predominantly the unit of account for actual payments inside of the crypto industry and so there's like I'll call it the purest side of things which is like okay we'll do the the lightning Network on top of Bitcoin because it is the the you know the immaculate currency Satoshi stepped away no one no parties all that all that stuff but then there's like okay stable coins you're kind of beholden to usdc or you're you'll be holding the paxos or someone but it also is the thing that is being used as payment so was there like a kind of a cost benefit analysis and maybe you can walk us through that yeah so I mean for for the record I'm actually all for or stable coins on top of lightning when when that becomes a thing and there there are a number of work streams that are out there to make that happen uh I think my problem is actually if you're dependent on one stable coin uh or one asset to be the the native core settlement asset of uh payment Network then you have a problem because uh the the algorithmic stable coins don't work in my opinion I really believe that it'll never work um and so uh stable coins need to have a reserve and someone controls that reserve and if someone controls that preserve then it's the single point of failure of your entire payment network if you're solely dependent on it and so the way we we look at the the world and the way we're building is basically that a fraction of a Bitcoin on top of lightning is a little bit like a TCP packet for Value this is basically the transport Network for the value that you're trying to transport from point A for two point B and so you can definitely do that with Bitcoin natively and move Bitcoin around but most people to your point don't want to transact in Bitcoin they want to buy Bitcoin and sit on it for the longest possible amount of time um and so what we need to make happen is basically um enable those transfers in Bitcoin enable transfers that are basically converted out of the edges into whatever Fiat currencies you want so that basically you're sending you know dollars to another place in the world that wants uh pesos or whatever it is and they get it and Bitcoin is completely abstracted from the transaction or you want to add Bitcoin but my point is you want to add stablecoin sorry um and my but my point is actually that you you shouldn't depend on any of these things to actually make the network work at the basic layer your your TCP packet needs to be this neutral thing that no one entity or person controls so that that's how we see this thing actually working over time and so so you have neutral settlement asset neutral settlement network not controlled by anyone open subject to regulations in various regions that are relevant to the region and you know the endpoints that are basically regulated endpoints that are using the network can actually fulfill those regulatory obligations at the edges but then you have a truly open interoperable network and you choose to use whatever asset actually solves your problem um best right Fiat great stable coins great that's basically the way but you but not dependent on one thing but I think bankless listeners will know you know David and I and bankless um we we are big fans of of Bitcoin and the lightning Network and anything that helps us go more beckless uh obviously and we're also um huge proponents of ethereum and have done a ton of episodes and you know a ton of work inside of kind of that ecosystem and I you know I hear bankless listeners asking this question so I I want to relay that question on their behalf and also on Maya and David's behalf um why not ethereum as a potential and some context for that question is I actually do think that ethereum can support kind of the you know the the money type use cases that you're talking about um we've been proponents of you know ether as an asset similar to bitcoin like money um you know Bitcoin has some other attributes like Immaculate Conception and I think you could get into sort of a debate about that but at the end of the day most free market folks will will tell you that if the world will select the best money right it's kind of not up to you know you or I or like podcast debates we're not going to select the money time will tell and the you know the most effective money will be selected for it but anyway um ethereum went through kind of a state Channel type of phase and it never really took off so I remember State Channel technologies that are comparable in some ways to uh lightning on ethereum when it's called Raiden um there's lots of just different attempts at State channels uh the reasons it failed uh are you know kind of partially lost to me now but but some of them are capital efficiency was very difficult and it just proved that there were easier ways to kind of scale uh cheap payments you know ethereum's been going into kind of a layer two type of uh direction as light which is a bit more robust than just a state Channel style uh payment Network so anyway the overarching question is um why lightning why Bitcoin why not ethereum okay so first of all I want to make an opening comment um I think in our industry we're all totally insane for being so dogmatic about one thing versus the other I think we're so self-imbued in you know evm is better Bitcoin is better it's a new layer one is better and if we just take a little bit of elevation altitude and realize how meaningless we all collectively are compared to the real world out there it would do us a lot of good because we could then Elevate and be like okay like this is not a religion we're not swearing allegiance to like one chain or another or a protocol Or Another We're all here to solve problems and there are very many problems that we need to solve collectively and if we just focused on working and picking the best solution for the problem at hand instead of fighting each other all the time then I think we would all be better off as an industry so that's my plug for we're all working towards the same goal let's stop being dogmatic about how we actually solve the problems um now uh so and by the way I'm um I'm not you know a laser eye Bitcoin person and at all I believe that you know the there's good stuff that Bitcoin actually provides uh and is unique for and you know and we we're going to talk about it in a sec and I think there's a gazillion things that ethereum is actually much better at uh and will solve different kinds of problems um the reason I actually believe that uh Bitcoin is the way to go for all things related to money and payments uh is is is is a multiple uh multiple step thing so the first one is what we've discussed like there's no leader or visible leader of the movement that's not through that's not true of ethereum right we have italic and I'm a big fan of his I think he's done amazing work but he has a very very uh powerful voice in the ecosystem uh and I think if he thinks that a change in the protocol is actually going to bring something uh better for all kinds of different reasons uh people will listen to him more than any other random person working on it uh so that's one two uh the the proof of stake approach to governance um is solving many problems and is actually good in terms of incentives for all kinds of different things but I think that the reality is um human nature gets in the way and the vast majority of people actually don't care about the direction of travel of the protocol and they're going to do delegated Stakes with large exchanges that will have also a predominant voice uh in how the world is going to look like and their Core Business is actually not money movement it's trading and they're regulated entities and so as such I feel like that's a weakness of the overall Network and into governance that works great for tokenized assets for trading for decentralized compute for nfts and for all these things which is what it should really be but if it touches at the core payment systems that we talked about um it's a it's a weaker uh it's a weaker um set up from a governance standpoint and presents more of a surface of attack um and then lastly there's Bitcoin the asset itself so Bitcoin the asset itself um has no equivalent out there in terms of liquidity against other assets whether it's Fiat or other assets at exchanges or other trading companies and that in itself if you're trying to have a neutral global settlement asset out there is a huge deal right because then the spreads between the actual settlement asset and the currencies that people want to touch or trade in is actually quite tight compared to other assets including eat and and that's a good thing so so all for all of these reasons uh it's actually worth um you know really powering through the pain of building over a channel based payment system which to your point hasn't worked before yes for Capital efficiency reasons but that actually can be solved but mainly I think because it's way too complex to actually manage and operate which is exactly what light spark does is actually remove all of that complexity for people in the same way that you know you would think of you know back in the early internet days like you know bgp routing and all these things were really very complicated things like so much so that even now if you would ask people to explain it to you it would be hard to to happen like to find someone who's actually able to have a coach and answer through that question um and so you know it's hidden now low in the low layers of a Cisco router or whatever router it is but it just works I think we can do the same thing with the lightning Network make it really work and remove all that complexity and that's what we're focused on and and so that's a long-winded answer to your a question of why Bitcoin and and the fact that I think that actually it would do a lot of good if we figured out ways to unlock all of that Bitcoin liquidity for all kinds of evm apps um in a way that's not wrapped Bitcoin in a way that's actually you know can we actually build an effective ways to bring all of the Innovation all of the energy all of the technological advances that are happening on on ethereum uh and uh Bitcoin liquidity together I think if we were able to figure something uh there uh we would all benefit from it I know we don't want to enter in the world of dogmatic tribal fighting but there's a few things that I have to have to say just or else all of my ethereum friends will get mad at me for not bringing it up the the proof of stake is uh governance the centralized governance angle uh the ethereum the what I would and what I agree with is that that's actually just a technical inaccuracy in fact the ethereum specific flavor proof of stake and proof of work have the same level of governance over the chain um people conflate proof of stake with on-chain governance uh but really it's just a Randomness mechanism and a decentralization mechanism uh and so because you own shares of ethereum you get to process a certain amount of transactions but that doesn't give you any sort of control over the direction of the chain it's meant to be as governance minimized as proof of work it just gets conflated very very frequently uh with other delegated proof-of-sake systems like Solana that do have on chain uh on chain governance um so I just kind of want to want to throw that one out there yeah I mean I I I feel like that's that's where it is now I feel like you know the where where it's going in terms of concentration of power I think is a different question and I think it I mean to me and we would say the same things about proof of work minors no no of course yeah I just think that the difference is actually that you know the the the proof of work Miners and a hash rate distribution is actually I think more fungible as in it'll move around and uh and the difficulty will adjust uh versus like regulated exchanges that are delegated uh for uh the sake of proof of stake that you know are very tangible and you know unmovable objects so I think I mean we can go on for a long time again we I think you know I mean my perspective like that's my own personal point of view yeah is that like there's this Immaculate Conception thing called Bitcoin uh that is going to be just great for money related things uh specifically targeted to moving value globally in a seamless really you know cost-effective interoperable open way um and then there's going to be all kinds of other innovations that are actually required to happen that will happen on ethereum uh and we need both to succeed for us to achieve this goal of you know more efficiency more decentralization more power back in the hands of people and uh and we need both of these things to succeed I mean there's a kind of an interesting angle there where um for instance like you know in most parts of the world collateralization of assets for access to Capital is completely messed up right it's like you know bureaucracy corruption all kinds of different things get in a way of you collateralizing your house or your car or any asset that you own for you to unlock access to Capital and basically get to Prosperity um and so for instance like that should be the focus of nfts like nfts can be that collateralization asset that that collateralized asset that exists on chain that you can provably say is yours and then you should be able to unlock access to Capital by doing that I would love for more people to work on that rather than attaching jpegs to nfts um but but that's one one use case when you think about like Financial Freedom and opening uh opening more capabilities uh through these Technologies that's one thing that actually ethereum will be much better at than Bitcoin fine but then the the mechanism by which the capital is dispersed and you have access to money and you move it around then you make the economy more efficient and you unlock all of that GDP that's stuck in archaic rails that thing is more a Bitcoin thing right so but those two things you can see in this example how these two things could work much better uh together than uh separate I think I think part of the reason uh David you're saying that um you know that or part of the reason I see that this isn't a religious bet even though I would I would totally argue that many crypto tribes are you know making religious predictions and making religious bets but the good thing about all of this is we get to see who's right in the end don't we we get to see like we can make our bets basically on the assets that we choose that we think have uh store value type properties and monetary properties and as entrepreneurs as well we can make bets and I think it is notable that um you're making a bet on Lightning the state channel uh technology one thing I will say is back to kind of like the shared values that we all have I think that bankless has the shared values of a decentralized open permissionless money system right and to the extent that lightning embodies those values and makes that happen we are incredibly supportive of that and so um what we're all making our bets and trying to work towards that future and on that I think we can we can certainly stack hands absolutely so David as we kind of close this out um last question for you so as you zoom out and think about the long term for all of this if if you're successful if crypto is successful in general if we start to separate money from State payment from State uh and even from tech companies and the way that we're all hoping and planning to what does the world look like in five to ten years well first of all I don't think that I'm in the camp of people who want to fully separate money from State I feel like actually uh you know my my own personal objective is actually make the underlying rails really efficient really open really interoperable and enable more people to have access to them uh I think that uh the the world where uh actually good governments cannot control their own monetary policy Etc this this uh this you know World um where it doesn't exist would be uh chaos so you are definitely not a laser-eyed maximalist then no no I'm not I'm I'm definitely not I feel I mean I feel like so here's my view on this I feel like those Technologies and the fact that there are alternatives that people can actually go to will be a very helpful check and balance to keep everyone honest on the other side the fact that there's no alternative is bad for everyone and I think that you know if you're a good government you have good monetary policy you look after the interest of your constituents um then you know everyone will choose to continue using your thing and that's great uh if you're uh Venezuela uh then you know I'm all for Bitcoin being an escape valve for people who are basically getting screwed over uh again and again you want to force the competition yeah I mean you want to have alternatives for people and those Alternatives can actually be regulated because like no one wants like you know actually bad money laundering terrorists moving money around and all these things for which by the way those new networks are a lot a lot harder for them to operate because like they get caught a lot more than on the traditional system but you so you don't want like total World chaos like you want like a check and balance and Alternatives that are really solid alternatives for people um and I feel like there's a measured path here of those things being well regulated to protect consumers and to enable governments and good governments to conduct monetary policy and to control uh you know their country to some extent um I think that's important and so so you know there's kind of a technological angle of like unlocking all of these capabilities for people while uh enabling good governments to do their work and I think that's um that's that's where I stand personally yeah I I agree with that and I think that's where you know so if we get out of this whole crypto uh experiment that uh the world has another option other than Fiat in which to digitally store their value like we win that not not to say that everything is 100 crypta of course and then we also achieve a banking system based on open credibly neutral permissionless internet style decentralized architecture I think those are the wins that we're all searching for um the exact same camp here this is exactly the way I think about things well David we wish you uh much success then and much luck you are one of the rare breeds of Bitcoin Builders who are who are pioneering lightning and um you know uh best of luck with that very excited to see the progress in the weeks and years to come thank you so much and thanks for having me risks and disclaimers of course bankless Nation gotta let you know again none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky ether is risky so is Bitcoin but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot thank you
