bankless nation welcome to this edition of alpha league alpha league is the episode where we go and find a project in crypto that people are excited about and today we are talking to the team members behind velodrome uh we're gonna get into velodrome what it is in just a hot second but here we have gabagool otherwise known as gaba he does bd stuff business development we also have alex cutler who's doing comms and operations we got tau who's coming in on the tokenomics and strategy side of things and we also got drac jack also doing strategy and also business development uh these are some of the the members of the velodrome dao of sorts we're going to figure out how velodrome is organized behind the scenes guys welcome to the show thanks for having us it's great to be here yeah thank you thank you cheers all right let's go ahead and get right into it and just start with the obvious question what is velodrome yeah so i'm having to take that to the towel so veldrone in essence is an automatic marking maker which offers low slippage swaps on the optimism network and to offer low slippage your drone incentivizes liquidity in a very similar way as curve does on each maintenance which means uh vioju basically emits tokens uh the velo token on a weekly basis where um the holders of the evil which is the locked version of the token can vote on on which pairs to direct emissions to so kind of like to take a little bit of a step back when you think of curve you can grab the curved token crv the same way that you can grab or acquire the velo token then lock it for a number for a period of time up to four years maximum the longer that you lock it which means you kind of give away liquidity of the token the longer that you lock it the more vote power you have also of course depending on the balance of how many frequency lock and with that volt power then you can decide as a ve vlog holder where emissions should go in terms of the total pairs that are being offered on the on the marketplace and it is a permissionless marketplace where people can propose new tokens to be whitelisted um and once in one token is what listed on the marketplace anybody can create a pool with those tokens or any combinations on the of the tokens and also create a gauge on which emissions can be voted and distributed uh to incentivize the treatment the liquidity joins the marketplace and you offer the very good signage on stops especially we have stable players and volatile pairs with different formulas that also add some efficiency to the swaps and if anybody was familiar with solidly and phantom theorem is actually designed based on saline's model which was um kind of launched by ander conyer a famous developer uh most most people should probably know about him but suddenly had some troubles in once it was launched uh we as a team were part of b-down which uh basically was uh farming as a service protocol um sort of like a protocol that allowed anybody any retail holder to play the salary wars but we were sort of like a team strategizing and how to do how to follow the best strategy to use the mechanics on solidly to acquire vote power direct emissions increase report power and basically maximize the value driven back to holders of the of vdo token which surely we can you can speak about a little bit more of that history but i mean this is the essence of polygon it's it's a automated market maker that is very efficient offers very low slippage and has been driving a lot of tvl we're acquiring a lot of tvl and an optimism last i checked i think we're at uh 15.5 million uh dollars of tvl which is pretty decent for these markings yeah yeah you know uh andre when he launched solidly which as tao mentioned uh is is what uh velodrome is is based off of he described it as a next generation amm because in many ways it draws from sort of the best elements of curve um the best elements of sort of convex the best elements of of v3 and take sort of all the lessons that have been sort of learned over the years about what works really well in those models and what doesn't sort of tries to bring them together in a single protocol and i think the one other thing i would add is a protocol designed to be an ecosystem public good right um very much a protocols protocol uh that incentivizes active liquidity versus passive where you know 100 of bribes 100 of fees go back to the voters versus sort of going to uh those lps and so yeah velodrome is our take on that next generation amm um and bring it into an ecosystem that is actively growing uh in in the form of optimism yeah so let me uh repeat back to you guys uh what i heard just uh to check my understanding uh it's uh the the idea is that the curve wars are a success as in the curve wars do the job that they are intended to do which is maintain decentralization of curve while also inducing liquidity curve as an amm is also an uh a success uh and and so like it does a good job of actually providing liquidity uh where it's not a success is it is kind of confined to just like kind assets and it doesn't have to be that way there is like you can take the curve model and apply it to volatile pairs where unit swap v3 has really had that success with the concentrated uh security the concentrated liquidity model and so from what i'm gathering velodrome is taking the curve wars token issuance model is taking the curve amm structure by adding in unit swap v3 concentrated liquidity to also create and also enable volatile non-like kind pair liquidity and it's also built on top of the optimism v2 is all these parts these are all the components the relevant components that make up velodrome yeah the the only node is that uh we don't have univ3 functionality we don't have the concentrated liquidity so the the volatile model that we're using is is uni v2 but you're correct in that it's a uni v2 model slotted into the like ve token um sort of structure um and emissions and bribes and all those sorts of things that are familiar from the the curve model can we talk about let's unpack that a little bit because i've always kind of thought like unit swap v2 the basic amm curve uh it got iterated on in unispot v3 because it was capitally inefficient like capital efficiency and v3 is kind of the whole thing um what are the benefits of using the curve structure and maybe we could also further just the beginner list and listeners out there if somebody could explain the difference between curve curves like a pricing algorithm versus unit swaps like unit swap v2 it's x times y equals k it's this very smooth curve curve's algorithm is a little bit different can you talk about just like just some basic amm design structures how curve is different from unit swap and then how you guys iterate on curve well one thing i'll say is that i think the uniswap v3 model really is like the gold standard in terms of uh efficient concentrated liquidity but uh it's not very accessible for retail liquidity providers um we've seen a lot of data that shows that your average lp on univ3 is is losing money and that has certainly not been the case for the univ2 model everybody's been losing money in this market brother that is certainly true um yeah you know with univ3 it's really a uh i think it's more for your more sophisticated market makers for your larger lps and our model is a bit more retail friendly and jack or tao might be able to comment further on the price curves yeah i would add uh if you think about um kind of like if you're a purple and you want to have a creativity token on unib3 you sort of depend on all the players to go ahead and kind of be strategic about it and and provide that concentrated liquidity that unib3 does provide which kind of does help some of the players but if you actually want to incentivize your token liquidity before it actually captures the attention of liquidity providers you can actually come on velodrome and acquire reload lock it and then start voting on your pool and you'll get that tvl automatically because people will fire me to get the velo token or you can ride that pool so it's it's a way for any protocol to very quickly acquire liquidity or or accumulate liquidity uh on an amm um by actually having a very capital efficient like a couple of tools that can be very capital efficient for them to do so so if you again if you acquire velo and lock it you continue to hold your position as you incentivize the pool and also you receive the fees back for your own pool so you're sort of you can actually increase the value of your position over time while providing you know while getting into before you're talking so on on the mechanics it actually helps protocols build that liquidity very quickly on the swaps themselves the the stable swaps as you say you know we use a very different formula the uh the actual formula i think it's uh x squared y plus y squared x equals the environment constants that are attached to each of the tools but the the simple way of thinking about it is when you have stable swaps you basically have the balances of two tokens and what the pool does is that it allows one of the tokens to be majorly imbalanced and in a stable pool without changing the price too much and this of course works with stables because they will should have other mechanisms other than pools to hold the peg if they don't date they don't work for us as they were or as a stable clear um so the pool itself doesn't worry too much about the imbalance basically allows a bit more imbalance in essence in uh you know if the stable coin is really collapsing eventually it does come to a point where it falls very quickly right once it gets to a point where the balance is so high that it's very clear that the peg is being lost then you see very uh radical price movements but while that doesn't happen this the price stays very very stable because it just the pool allows that whereas the typical or the the uni v2 price curve actually is very reactive to movements imbalances on the pool so having that flexibility and that difference between the the types of swaps that does allow for greater efficiency on both sides would i be correct in saying that uh the the the velodrome strategy is to optimize for ease of liquidity providing and that like liquidity providing in unison v3 is super complicated because you actually have to take an opinion as to the direction of the market and most retail investors just wanted like lazy lp so it's a strategy of like velodrome to kind of have the best of both worlds of like concentrated ish concentrated concentrated ish liquidity using a curve model a manipulated curve model but also the lazy lping that was so awesome to have in uniform v2 is is that like the things we're trying to combine here yeah and i add one additional layer on top of that which is uh because uh velodrome is very much designed for protocols it's also about where the the value sort of accrues so certainly there needs to be enough rewards and incentives to attract um lps and so the only rewards that lps get on velodrome is emissions of the vivo token and those emissions are of course chosen by uh ve velo uh voters but um just as an example uh the op token right now the two primary on-chain sort of sources of liquidity are velodrome in the form of a velo usdc pair and on univ3 in the in the form of op the token pair on velodrome is producing hundreds of thousands dollars in fees that go back to the e v low voters and who is the primary voter the optimism foundation right so their liquidity that they have attracted through velodrome is producing them revenue um and on unit swap who's earning that revenue the lps it's not a profitable activity for for um optimism in fact you know they have a deal with you know a market maker to sort of ensure that liquidity is there and in some ways they're paying for it so like i think what you're describing david is exactly right in that the dynamics for lps is are a little bit different but i think in the end it's about protocols having the ability to attract liquidity in a way that is actually revenue positive for them without them having to sort of use their own token uh to to do so or to to pay somebody else to do so all that value sort of flows back to that all all flows back to the voters yeah alex let's go into that a little bit more because i'm starting to see some alignment with like the whole optimism ethos of like public goods funding uh and can you continue that conversation there how is the velodrome model just more conducive to integrations and other protocols around optimism and also optimism itself yeah jack maybe do you want to jump in there a little bit yeah i think the the main focus that we have is as we've mentioned to be a public good what does that mean it means that the work that we do helps the ecosystem thrive in our case uh we've mentioned that optimism is a is a fairly large uh stakeholder in in velodrome which means that they have a lot of power over where emissions are directed um so let's let's take this from the perspective of a new protocol that wants to launch on optimism uh i don't have a lot of money because nobody has a lot of money in this type of climate but what i do have are some some good partnerships with eco with the foundation i'm getting a grant from um from governance and i'm getting some probably some optimism tokens um sent over to me directly from them right so what i can do is through through us and really not anywhere else on the um yeah on optimism currently uh we can start to do one of two things either a um start to buy up uh some of our tokens um sorry start to buy up some velo tokens um to unlock them so that we can vote for our you know our new protocols native pool paired against you know ether or usdc um thereby providing liquidity for for my token or i can bribe um some you know some v lockers to to direct ambitions to that pool um what's happened here is that without soliciting vc without trying to raise substantial sums of money i'm able to do the one thing that every protocol has to do when they're getting started that's to get liquidity for whatever operations they have or for their own basic token if they have um that's the basic premise there's there's a lot that's going to i think flow from that premise but foundationally um the idea is that we are we say that we're an amm but we're also a liquidity marketplace and in the context of an ecosystem that means that we are the clearinghouse of the kind of the foundational uh activity that that occurs in d5 on optimism yeah andre described it as he designed the incentives of solidly to align everyone's incentives such that voting for the uh pools that are most important to the ecosystem is the most incentivized behavior right and that by virtue of that if a new protocol wants to be sort of onboarded to the optimism ecosystem as jack said they have to bootstrap their own uh liquidity it is very much in the interest of folks like us as a team the velodrome team right to vote for emissions to those uh pools when they join likewise is optimism being able to control a ton of sort of the voting power and emissions allows them to say hey new protocol looking to get started we don't have to spend any money in order to uh sort of get you on boarded you might not even need to spend any money like you just need uh emissions you know white-listed pool admissions directed to them we will vote for it that doesn't have to be purely altruistic we also get all the fees by virtue of having you know voted for your initial liquidity and then that sort of protocol you know like jack said through bribes through farming through their protocol and liquidity through locking is able to sort of build that initial foundation and that's how you get this like virtuous cycle in the ecosystem and the kind of growth that of course every l2 and optimism in particular is so focused on right now right and this just fits in right into optimism's retroactive public goods mechanism where generalized activity on optimism kind of flows into block space demand which flows into funding for further projects right and so now there's this other part of optimism which is this velodrome mechanism this gadget that can kind of has a brain and can put liquidity into places that it needs to put liquidity at that specific moment in time and then optimism to layer two and the governance over optimism has this ability to think about like all right like what's the best where should we point this liquidity in this particular moment in time to help this thing get bootstrapped and maybe this thing that we're bootstrapping is also this thing that we are also funding with retroactive public goods to help that thing get started and that's just like you know elementary school and then once it graduates through elementary school then it can go on and do its way and then like and then and then it becomes part of the self-sustaining part of optimism yeah is that kind of the vision that you guys share here yeah 100 i think a good example of this so first of all you know uh velodrome is an entirely bootstrapped project um we'll get into like the exact story but uh one of our you know optimism gave us a hundred and fifty thousand dollar grant which we used to def to fund front end and back end development of velodrome it's you know quite a small amount of money compared to you know how much you know a new d5 protocol will often raise and so what did we provide in return for that capital we said we will work with any project that you want to come over to optimism and we will if they're open to it partner with them provide them a initial airdrop of vote locked velo and help you know kind of usher this project on to optimism um a good example of of kind of how we executed these partnerships is synthetics has all of these um kind of baby synthetic projects projects built on top of synthetic so lyra thales cuenta uh aylin and we went to all these projects and said um you know what do you need what what are your liquidity needs and really the the large the big answer was there's not sufficient susd liquidity on optimism it's getting there but it's not there yet so we've ended up working with lyra very closely fails synthetics to help bolster s usd liquidity and to bring more liquidity for their native tokens and uh you know we've seen these protocols bribing in our in our ecosystem and also uh you know directing emissions and managing their own uh vnft positions yeah and you know that's such an interesting example yeah because you know they all want to take on tradfy right they want uh big big dollars uh feeding things like options trading perpetuals all these sort of different financial mechanisms and yeah as gaba said they said number one barrier to uh sort of achieving that vision is deep deep liquidity on uh synthetic pairs susv usdc being one of the most important so how they've been getting that traditionally uh they've accumulated you know some amount of curve um they've been bribing uh via convex uh directing some emissions to those pools and you know on curve they've got you know a few million uh dollars in there but what is that generating for the the ecosystem not much i mean it's they are basically paying to attract that liquidity um as a voter they might earn a portion of those fees but on curve 50 of the fees go to lps 50 uh go to the voters on velodrome um we are massively boosting sort of the liquidity on on susd and rather than each of those ecosystem partners needing to pay for that that liquidity is actually paying them so if you imagine you know millions and millions of dollars of volume flowing through those uh susd pools is no longer just like an investment those protocols need to make in order to like basically fund their growth that growth is going to become a revenue stream for them because 100 of the fees of those pools gather um goes right back to them so it is like it is the ultimate kind of like win-win model and you know i think this is why you know andre had this idea he distributed a hundred percent of ownership initially solidly to the protocols on on phantom we tempered that a little bit because we think we have that had some unintended consequences but the idea is the same right the protocols should own it and the protocol should earn all the fees all the bribes because ultimately this is this is base layer infrastructure for the ecosystem it's not to make us money you know it's it's not to sort of serve our investors or vcs it's for the ecosystem and and to put a better point on it for the optimism collective as well um it really shouldn't be overlooked that they are collecting massive fees from this which gives them more capacity to fund public goods and uh potentially you know more more of a i think a justification for um or an answer to um questions about how how this ecosystem uh intends to to generate value so just to clarify that as an lp i don't collect any fees you do not like trading fees um you collect you are uh rewarded by uh velo admissions which are directed to you from um from the voters right okay and so the velo token collects the fees and as an lp i collect a velo token correct you vote if you if you lock it okay so so they're they're the velodrome as the amm it does collect fees it puts it into the velo token but only if you lock the token as an lp i receive the velo token but i only get more velo tokens if i lock the token and so the the idea here is that it forces alignment uh between the velodrome project the velodrome protocol and like all the applications on velodrome this also starts to feel a little bit like tokamak where like you get to have the token you get to like direct liquidity around the space um it's an interesting model just to uh to not give any fees to the lps um and maybe this is a question like uh i would imagine maybe the biggest stable coin providers in curve lp providers and curve perhaps might also be crv owners as well uh i'm guessing that is true i don't know if that's any any truth in fact i think you guys are just like skipping forward in this in this like logical conclusion of just like well no if like we can just force more alignment with the protocol itself by putting all of the fees into the protocol and also force you to lock up your your your velo tokens uh can you guys just check my thinking on this and just like elaborate on the decision here yeah i mean i think that's exactly right we we're basically centralized you know vocalizing all the value of dropping the drives where that flows through the protocol on the vehicle um so the fact that these go to ve low uh token holders or uh vote locked token holders makes or creates value for the low liquid token and truck because now you have an extra incentive to acquire it and lock it especially if you're a pilot so by vocalizing the the value on v-low you also deliver greater value throughout peace because lps will receive this this token that in essence can also have these flowing back to it once it's locked another thing that we haven't touched on is that it has an element of the 3-3 model that olympus dal initially introduced in that ve or vote locked velo tokens get a uh epoch rebate so every week they get a slightly based that controls for dilution so lps are receiving tokens but uh the deal is also increasing its balance so that allows for admissions to be or basically to do it to be admitted into purpose really and in fact the emissions schedule will basically run forever until you know as long as the blockchain exists uh the emissions will continue to run and build them so that allows the incentives for lps to always be there without diluting uh voters uh too much or at least controlling foreign and that dilution also or that rebase also uh is based on the percentage of total supply that is brought yeah i was going to say that the one other uh consideration that that's important i want to be sure to hit is it's uh the fees aren't equally distributed amongst voters uh the the fees 100 of the fees go to the the voters who actually voted for that specific pool um and bribes uh as well go to the the folks who who voted for those pools so ideally that should to your point david align the incentives fully uh to direct it to basically the highest fee the most efficient um sort of pools on the network okay so you as a ve token holder you are most incentivized to direct emissions towards the pools that that collect the highest fees correct yeah how do you square that with like okay there's this brand new uh protocol that needs to be bootstrapped and by proxy of that it's therefore not getting very many fees because it's brand new why would somebody vote for that brand new protocol then uh if there's not much if there's not much feed volume there i think that's where bribing really comes in and we're just starting to see the beginning of a bribing economy emerge on velodrome we never really saw it properly with solidly because there were fundamental uh you know errors uh flaws in the bribing architecture but um you know for a emergent protocol it probably would be cheaper to bribe a pool to bootstrap liquidity at the start than it would be to uh purchase uh an amount of you know vote locked velo to bootstrap a certain amount of liquidity of course those numbers are variable depends on the price of velo depends on the price of the native token but fundamentally that is how the protocol is intended to work that there's a balance between basically the cost of liquidity for from bribing and the cost of liquidity from directing admissions yeah yeah and and likewise why you know somebody like optimism having a large portion of the voting control having interests outside of just uh collecting fees likewise with us you know we plan to to maintain some degree of an ecosystem position right that we can sort of direct votes um to help new protocols bootstrap so there will always be an element of that but uh between bribes between those sort of like ecosystem actors it should basically make it very easy to incentivize uh liquidity for new projects entering knowing that more projects more velocity these are all net net positive uh things for velodrome and for for optimism broadly so you guys mentioned that you got a 150 000 grant from optimism to get started is that all of your funding or how how is this thing like self-sustainable how are you guys putting food on the table here yeah well so i think it's important to go back to the beginning of the project with vidao on solidly um so i'm the founder of a dow called information token information token is a uh investing research and incubation dao we do early stage venture we incubate projects and we do some consulting work and so jack tau and myself are all members of information token and information token incubated vidao vidao is this farming as a service project that launched with a high emissions yield farm to capture enough tvl to receive uh a solidly nft i think at our peak we had 2.5 billion dollars worth of tvl on phantom in vidao farms and so throughout that process we learned a lot about vote escrow to economics we studied solidly very closely and when we kind of saw the writing on the wall with with how the flaws and solidly were you know having implications on the market we started talking to optimism and they were quite interested in having a uh another source of liquidity aside from uniswap on optimism and so they agreed to bootstrap uh you know the funding of of velodrome with that hundred and fifty thousand dollar grant we also um have given ourselves a a small percentage of emissions uh alex might be able to talk more specifically about that but really this is a team it's a you know we're we're decentralized we are funded entirely from that grant and then um from some leftover funds that were in the vdow treasury that just today actually will end up receiving um it i think all the people involved in building this project are i don't want to say it's like entirely altruistic we have upside if phelodrome succeeds we stand to make more money but um we're really kind of in d5 to experiment on the bleeding edges of uh you know a new technology and that's really the ethos that at least uh we came into this project with from kind of this dow that we're all a part of so how is the the dao structured uh can we take a peek inside i'm assuming it's a discord uh how many people are in there like and like how many actual like value contributors and like i know like there's a loose loose lines between who's unofficially on the team and who's it's a dow member but overall can you guys just characterize like the workforce behind velodrome yeah yeah i can speak to that a little bit so um as gaba mentioned right we started as vedau right and and vidao's initial purpose right was totally around maximizing sort of control of solidly but as soon as we realized that experiment wasn't going to work and we sort of shifted our focus to incubating velodrome we basically had a ton of different people who who sort of came into the vdow community that we use sort of the the weave token which was our dow token at the time to sort of help uh incentivize uh participation and i would say that the group that contributed to the incubation of elodra was probably you know maybe around like 30 35 folks um some of course you know very much sort of full time i think everybody on this call was was pretty solely devoted to it um other folks you know were more folks who just sort of dropped in or dropped out had a certain set of skill sets making videos making content contributing to strategy but when we were sort of deciding how we would structure filodrome having gone through a really uh tumultuous sort of dow experience i think we decided that initially we did not want velodrome to be a dow so um governance is obviously very uh important to the product itself in the sense that uh you know in the end it's it's velo lockers that control emissions but we as a team are sort of in the process of figuring out what our new structure will be so most of those 35 folks are of course still engaged right and you know our discord is very live and rich and right now we're just sort of figuring out especially on a shoestring basically how do we bootstrap you know about six months of pretty focused effort we've got a lot that we still want to do for the product we have a lot of folks who want to of course ensure our are taken care of so they can put that time of energy into it but it remains i think the sort of spirit of a doubt very egalitarian very little structure very just transparent very much like raise your hand uh if you want to chip in and if if you're you know going on a trip going to nyc new york and gotta bounce for a little bit it's okay somebody else will pop in and you know we we're just doing our best to sort of reward the those ongoing contributions with that little bit of uh sort of money that we've got left over from the initial bootstrap as well as of course uh some of that velo that was allocated to a team and a share of those ongoing emissions but the cool thing as well you know we talked about the whole idea of this protocol is that by virtue of voting for pairs you you generate sort of um revenue we have this large ecosystem fund and by virtue of sort of using that ecosystem to vote for sort of key pairs and boost key pairs we now have revenue streams as well i think voting for die usdc over this last week uh equaled basically enough revenue in both dye and usdc from the trading fees to represent about a 150 apr right um so by virtue of us voting and helping to like grow the tvl and optimism we are also of course starting to generate just a little bit of that fee revenue which will eventually i think support a very autonomous protocol that doesn't require a team probably just requires a few people keeping the lights on that kind of thing so i think that's where we want to be in six months is that there really isn't much of a team anymore probably still a few folks in the community doing support all that sort of stuff but you know i think we're big decentralization people uh so the hope is eventually you know velodrome's a machine that's running yeah that is the uh the uh the dow model right like that's actually pretty unique to see in the space where you guys plan on or at least intend to taking off the hands as much as possible within six months that's that's pretty crazy most dolls mostly i was kind of like well you guys are going to get bigger not smaller aren't you uh it's unique to hear about a dow that actually is getting smaller let's go into the road map for this like what's it going to take to get to that point like what are you guys working on right now what are you guys going to be working on tomorrow and like what's just like the long-term vision for this whole thing yeah yeah so i'll speak a little bit to that um you know i think we have a several key focus right now areas of focus we have um making sure that the the product that we shipped is functioning at its highest level so fixing any remaining front end bugs making sure that all of our contracts are functioning properly so that people can vote bribe and uh provide liquidity seamlessly and that will probably be an ongoing effort but also uh we we that's what we have our devs on right now um we have pretty significant like biz dev uh efforts that are ongoing so talking with protocols who are either planning on deploying to optimism or in the process of deploying um for instance like alchemix is a partner of ours alchemix is not fully deployed to optimism but they are you know they are coming and as optimism acquires more of these kind of what i would call as mainnet primitives that allow people to you know really use that full suite of defy 1.0 tools i think that optimism will be a more lively and sustainable environment for for defy and then you know we're also continually trying to improve the analytics tools that we're providing to retail investors in velodrome so i had a call yesterday with apyvision about using some of their suite of of analytics tools to help investors understand the various kind of apy that are available weekly on our pools and alex can probably expand on all that yeah well actually jack do you want to sort of set up relay so we have the sort of vision for for what you might even call like 2.0 that we're calling relay yeah so uh at the start of this we talked about how uh how velodrome was combining some of the best elements of curve of uniswap and so on in convex we're now going to integrate what's best of the rest of that curve stack so now we're talking about the vodium llama union elements what we're going to be doing is focusing on improving the quality of life for uh for vote lockers uh specifically what we'll be doing is allowing i think two major things one is to uh is to provide automatic delegation of votes so if i'm a vote locker currently i have to vote every week in order to be able to claim bribes or uh you know or or potentially change my votes based on you know based on fees and that can be a pretty time consuming thing especially if i'm a protocol or if i'm uh somebody who's trying to profit maximize currently vodium offers this option uh for uh for lockers who um who want to profit maximize that's going to be an option that we offer they're also like a yearn strategy for for voting basically exactly built in built-in farming right um and uh and however there are there are some um i think potential um there's there's some interesting design space here um where where you can deal you could theoretically delegate your votes not necessarily to what's profit maximizing but what might be best for the ecosystem right i mean you could be a boat locker and say okay i'll give all my votes to uh to another uh to another participant maybe like uh like uh optimism you know so now now i'm delegating my votes to whoever optimism wants to do i collect the fees from that collect the bribes for that um and it becomes a really nice uh type of flight flywheel so that's that's one thing we're integrating that part the other part will be auto compounding um which would uh which now becomes a really interesting flywheel um because it it it's a way to keep basically uh any of the the value generated by the protocol inside the protocol one thing that we observed with curb and the convex uh and all the curb wars was that there are a couple of um really uh i think there are a couple of uh key weaknesses of that model um three specifically i mean one is that you have uh you have competing interests you have people trying to get uh trying to jockey for for control over this um over this protocol um and uh and you have a two token model uh you know or multiple token models as a result of this type of like stratified jockeying um what we're doing is we're using only one token that does all of the things uh that way you know when you're when you're trying to compound control there isn't um uh you know kind of a major question of where you ought to go uh finally what the the biggest quality of life is now we have a completely integrated ecosystem for liquidity inside a single ui i am not going from one website to another trying to figure out you know should i be you know on on curve should i be trying to acquire on convex you know am i am i going to be buying into fracs or you know whatever else right in order to be able to participate in this there is one place to do all of it um and so i think this to me seems like the the fullest realization of what liquidity um ought to look like in a you know in a strictly permissionless context yeah ui and ux isn't the uh the maybe most valued uh attribute in the in the in the d5 space but there are people who just want to say like i believe in d5 i believe in optimism i want to participate and i want that to you know show up in the form of some additional uh cash or income right and uh i'm a big fan of of curve and convex and vodium and llama air force but my gosh did it take a long time to figure all that out and and david y'all's podcast on curve i remember just being one of the best ones because it really broke it down for me i mean just imagine if that was all uh sort of one or two clicks within a single uh sort of product and that all the layers of additional people taking a cut along the way are not there anymore um you know convex it's something like 17 llama air force i think it's a deal of course but they're they're taking percentages um on it uh it's sort of spread out among so many folks whereas you can keep probably those fees much lower keep the value accrual within vela within the single token and make for a great uh user experience and so i think that's where we we want to go right we have the benefit of building all these pieces kind of as one whereas all of this sort of innovation happened uh independently and you know we can learn from the best of it and and build it right in hopefully plus plus low fees on the layer two of course so you get that and get that as well uh guys is there any stone that we haven't left unturned is there any aspect i haven't asked about yet boy well i i want to give a shout out to optimism it's really been a pleasure working with the team i think that it's rare to find people who uh you know from like the foundation level are so uh involved in supporting the ethos of decentralization and really pushing this space to uh you know fund public goods et cetera with the capital that they have and with their token so there really wouldn't be a velodrome without that grant from optimism and i just feel a lot of gratitude for the team what they've done for us and and what we've been able to accomplish working with them awesome guys well where can people go join velodrome dow go help contribute or just go find out more yeah uh check out our website
