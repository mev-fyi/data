hello hello welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i am carly riley and today on the show we have zenica 33 the nft influencer best known i should say as zenica 33 seneca is fantastic he was one of the first people that i reached out to for an interview i've followed him for a while he's just a wealth of information and wisdom when it comes to nfts and this space in general i think he's a really good person for beginners in particular to turn to but i also think if you've been in this space for a while he's just a great person for those reminders that we all need to hear sometimes uh those like truisms that we can forget when we get too deep down the nft rabbit hole so he's delivering a bunch of those in today's episodes he's going to talk about what he looks for in an nft project he's also going to tell us what he doesn't care about when it comes to an nft project and some of those might surprise you because he doesn't care about things that i think sometimes we're told we're supposed to care about and uh we're also gonna break down some specific projects like art blocks if you've been wanting to understand art blocks better zenika breaks it down for us he also recently launched his own nft project so at the time that he and i recorded this the project hadn't launched yet subsequently now it has launched so you can go check that out i will put a link to it here anyways enjoy the show enjoy zenika i so enjoyed this conversation but before we get right into it here's a word from our sponsors everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axiomfinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse xerion is the perfect place to view the

bankless welcome roy who people probably know much better as zenica33 i am so incredibly excited to have you on the show i'm really excited to have you early on on this show because i think what you do so well on social media on your sub stack in your podcast is really just share kind of broad wisdom about the nft space and how people should think about it you're really honest about what it can be like being deep in the nft space so i think you're a great way to to kick off this show in general and for anybody who's coming at it a little bit new or is a few months old in the space i just think you're you're a vessel of wisdom so thank you so much for joining me thank you for having me i'm excited to um to be part of this for sure love it so i want to start off easy here with your background tell us a little bit about yourself how did you get into nfts sure so before entities i'll start there i was a professional poker player for 15 odd years so i basically went from high school and into poker i so obviously that's an unconventional career and it has its whole stories and ups and downs but uh it sort of made the transition from my life as a professional poker player into crypto and nft a little more seamless than most because i didn't have like a traditional job i had to quit i just started becoming more interested in the space and it was like you started gambling with jpegs instead of yeah exactly yeah yeah uh so i sort of got into crypto a bit in 2016 2017 at like a lot of people and then when that big bear market hit it just you know you lose interest number isn't going up anymore and i didn't really have that conviction and attachment to the tech and like the underlying you know revolutionary stuff going on so i went back to poker and then start of this year 2021 again prices were going up again and people started getting more interested in crypto and so yeah so did i and i had a couple of friends who were they'd sort of been in the space you know for the last five five years and they were telling me about you know hash masks and nfts and you know thousands of dollars these jpegs crypto punks and obviously i'm sitting here thinking you know they're scat they're getting scammed they're in some ponzi scheme this is all ludicrous what are they doing uh and you know i sort of dismissed it as i think a lot of people do immediately when you hear about you know millions of dollars for a crypto punk or you know even thousands of dollars for anything uh 67 million dollar people or whatever yeah exactly that was the sticker shock i think that hit a lot of people that broke into the mainstream it was like yeah uh yeah but but eventually like they kept talking about it and i was like hang on these are really smart people i know that they've had very they have a lot of success in life i shouldn't just dismiss it and at first i was genuinely concerned that they were getting scammed like it was like are they actually you know because you have friends or people that get into like uh cults or like muslim marketing schemes and all sorts of stuff and smart people can get um into that but yeah i was like hang on these are really smart you know critical thinkers and let me just do some research and that sort of was the turning point where i think i read an article by packing mccormack on his sub stack not boring called power to the person and it was all about the creator economy and what nfts can unlock for artists for um coders for game designers for everyone really and and that really was the turning point for me and ever since then it's sort of been yeah just last eight months of all nfts uh i went from you know being an outside looker and then getting into the trading aspect buying and selling flipping and then i started creating content with my newsletter and my podcast and just all of it and um yeah now i know i have my own energy coming out in a couple of weeks and i'm sort of transitioning more towards the building side than the flipping per se but yeah i mean i just i love nfts and i'm really invested in the space not just financially but like in terms of the conviction i have in the longevity of it and the revolution it's gonna it is creating in the world and it's gonna keep creating for many many people and yeah i'm all about mgs i guess with the creator economy piece that's where the click moment happened for you with nfts was once you realized how creators could own their work in new ways is that is that a fair way to say it yeah so it was that was a huge part of it and it was also just the idea of a true digital ownership and how i mean that sort of the creative economy is born from the fact that we can now own assets in the digital space in a way that we never could before and it sort of made me understand hey okay so maybe these crypto punks that have been around for years were the first real like generative big project um i can understand now why they may be valuable because you know in 10 20 50 years from now if millions of people or billions of people or other are like investing in digital assets these very first ones that it's all sort of like stemmed from or grew from um they could really be worth a ton in a way that many may not be able to see right now one thing you've written about that i think is interesting is you've shared for lack of a better term a certain distaste for road maps i would say which is really common in nft projects pretty much every project that drops has a roadmap usually says something like at twenty percent five percent of the project we'll do a giveaway and at fifty percent we'll do a charity giveaway etc etc uh talk to me about why you're you're sometimes skeptical about road maps or how would you phrase that yeah so i i definitely don't like most road maps i think most projects like we have dozens of nfc projects launching a day maybe hundreds a week now which is already ludicrous but the thing is that most of them they're just sort of jumping on the back bandwagon and trying to copy the success of previous projects and they're effectively copying their roadmaps and and not really innovating and i think that's one issue i have like if a project says the roadmap is just sort of what you're saying 20 of the giveaway 50 you know community wallet will be funded 75 um we'll turn into charity that's great i love that aspect but it's just like it's nothing new it's nothing revolutionary and um yeah i just it doesn't excite me if i see a roadmap like that but to take a step back sort of from a bigger picture perspective even if the road map is exciting and innovative and and um appealing it's sort of my issue is that the energy space moves at hyper speed crypto space moves at high speed but things are changing and evolving so much that i would rather have the creators of a project the developers the whoever are behind it a bit more leeway to shape and adjust to what is happening in the market what new tech is being created whatever new thing is is being discovered and shape the roadmap so as make it up as they go along and the fact that a lot of people in the community want a roadmap and want to know what the project is going to do and then it's sort of written there like people buying projects saying hey this is their roadmap the creators are then obligated rightfully so i think to deliver on these things and it may be that some of them take several months to do and by the time it's ready to be launched no one really cares about that anymore it's like that was the hot thing three months ago and it's like i think we saw that with companions like um the board apes have their the kennel club companions and the punks had me bits and that was like a really cool thing to do and now every project has copied that and it's just it's not really that exciting or amazing or innovative anymore but because they had in their roadmap they feel obligated to do it they spend so much time and energy fulfilling these things that they said they're going to do because everyone seemed to want them um but they weren't really innovating they weren't really pushing the the boundaries and that yeah i would rather just have like a description of what what they want to do like their vision like you know how they never approach yeah exactly high level and i think yeah road maps can work especially if they're you know they are innovative and there is a good team behind it but 99 of them i think uh i'm not a fan of so you've written about how you pick projects and i thought it was a really awesome piece on substack we'll link to it what do you look for when you're evaluating a project or when you're getting into a project so the number one thing i always look for is the people i look at the people behind the project so that that's the team the developers the artists the managers and anyone involved in the creation of the project i want to know who they are i don't know what they've worked on before i want to know what they're like are they good people are they smart are they thoughtful um you know do they have the ability to take the amount of money that they're raising which is usually quite significant and use it for good for the good of the community for the good of not just their specific community but the wider nft community and just be smart and do make your decisions and so that's the most important thing like first and foremost it's always about the community i don't really look at the art that much first off i obviously don't really look or care about the roadmap um any of that stuff and then the second thing is again the people but i want to look at the community rather than the team behind the project so you know uh so many of these entity projects their success is um like lives and dies based on the the people that are invested and buying into these nfcs and so i want to like join their discord and see who else is interested in this project why are they interested in this what are they talking about and you can sort of tell um projects that are sort of built on a house of sand uh when the community and even the team sometimes they're all focused on price they just want number to go up they want people to sweep the floor and d-list and it's just sort of this it's it's not really creating any value of substance it's just there's nothing there and those are the sort of like ponzi nft projects that mlm style yeah where it's just about the existing users going getting news yes buyers you get new buyers and you're like yeah yeah no fundamentals that's where like these are the projects that when the real bear market hits they're just going to go crashing down and you know it's a concern i worry for people that get into the space that are new and maybe just get excited and caught up in all that and you know invest good money into these projects not necessarily um having the long-term conviction in it or not having a team behind it that's it for the long term so yeah i mean that's sort of a red flag i don't want to invest in those projects but if you join the discord and you chat to people who are interested and they're like hey i really like what this team is doing the team's there answering questions they're building something for the future they have really cool ideas that they want to execute on and you know they're listening to community feedback and people are really excited for where the project is going to be in two months three months a year and they're not really you know like bothered by the price too much then that's just a really good sign so it really just comes down to the people um and then after that like yes the art is important like i prefer if i if i like it but you know art is so subjective that if i don't like it other people might and if i love it maybe no one else it's like that is something that isn't a huge factor um i guess specifically in these products like 10 000 generated products we're talking about if i'm buying like one of one art or art blocks then obviously the art is is a much more determining factor but um yeah they're two separate kind of collections are there any projects you want to shout out that you think like hey that's a that's a great example if you go into their discord you go into their community their team is super strong they don't care about floor price what are you eyeing these days that you think are doing that well the one that just immediately comes to mind because they made an announcement like an hour ago is um blitmap and so their founder is uh his name is dom he was a co-founder of divine app if you remember that whatever yeah um he has been in the crypto space for a long time he's like a true builder innovator he really does create awesome products and um yeah so that's just one project but no one really cares about the price in there even though it's one gangbusters um it's difficult to shout it out because i think the full price is really high right now to get in but it wasn't for a long time um i'll shout out top dog beach club because that's a project that's been around for a few months um their price hasn't really done anything crazy i mean i think a time recording it's probably like 0.15 eth um and they minted at 0.08 i mean so obviously you know almost doubling in a few months that's by many metrics a smashing success but in the nfv space when people are used to like 10x 100x and they look at that and like uh it's kind of struggling but this space has ruined investing for anybody who's a part of it for all time i was like looking at something outside of sort of outside of crypto that was like a 20 return like nearly guaranteed you know and i was like that is such a great return yeah by any normal standard like hedge funds that have like a 20 return or like on top of the world and i'm like oh god like you know my 2 000 investment is 100k right now why would i ever waste my time 20 it's yeah yeah i would love to get your thoughts on the market broadly you talked about pfp projects versus art projects and how you approach that differently from an investment perspective do you have like mental models in your head this is something i've been trying to build up of like different categories of projects and therefore you kind of think about them differently or price them differently or hey there's pfp and then there's art and then there's utility like what are those categories to you if you have them yeah i've never really consciously sat down and thought about them but there's definitely a different approach to the profiling projects to the art especially the one-on-one art uh gaming projects it would be another big category and then sort of like the utility or membership aspect and i would say by and large like the gaming the utility projects are sort of much more designed to provide value over a longer term a lot of the gaming projects they're like obviously takes time and money and work to create a successful game a lot of play testing and back and forth so if they're they're launching now but the game may not be released till next year obviously you need to have a long-term vision but i i do think gaming nfcs are going to pop off and be huge and so the approach for investing into gaming entities is uh again for a much longer term vision whereas with these profile picture projects a lot of them are running on hype and fomo and short-term basis and it's it's much riskier to invest in them because a there's just an oversaturation of them in the market there's just tons of them popping up every single day and there's just not enough like despite the space growing at uh warp speeds there's still just not enough people enough money coming in just to support most of them being successful so most of them will fail and yeah i guess with the profile prophetic projects just understanding that it's it's higher risk yes you can because of that you can probably find 10x100x gains occasionally but many projects are just going to crash 99 yeah so i would approach them with a higher risk and the other things with a bit more lower risk would you describe yourself as more of a long-term investor or more of a flipper or a combination of the two definitely a combination so maybe like six eight months ago when i was first getting in it was more on the flipping side just because i didn't have much of a bankroll if i put one or 0.18 really into a project and then it went up to 0.2 0.3 um it just it made sense to take that out and then try and find other projects to invest in and uh it got like over time i became more of a long term holder just as i was being successful at flipping i was able to say mint two or three in a project and maybe sell two of them and hold one for the longer term if i believed in it and then as time has gone on um i was like minting more flipping more and then trying to find projects that i thought were really good for long term and putting and holding on to them more and now i'm at a point where i basically do very little flipping acne flipping like very rarely am i um buying things with the intention of selling it soon um if yeah anytime soon but um occasionally i'll be buying things and then selling them a few weeks later if they go up like 10x i'm like oh i should take some profits just because you should always take profits but um yeah now i'm focused more on the really long term and building in my own projects and advising other projects and it it's really sort of it's almost like a weight off my shoulders i don't feel like i need to be flipping anymore like even though there's good money in flipping i think um and it is fun and it was exciting it's just it's also stressful it's also a lot of time involved and you like you feel like you're missing something if you're not at your computer 24 7 and yeah i'm sort of happy to be to have moved on from that yeah yeah i have to say i so i i love you've called out warren buffett in a couple or maybe just the one but uh newsletters in the past and i got my start my first job out of college was at a hedge fund that was very much uh built around warren buffet's investment philosophy which is a very long-term orientation kind of a project so the flipping thing is very anathema to me and kind of hard to get into um and i think the the thing that makes me fearful about it for people is moments like this where you're having a bear market and i have i have a friend who's sort of started to get into nfts and i think she's been a little bit more in a flipping mentality and this this bear market is like hazard kind of freaked like i was getting texts this morning like you know why is it going down kind of yeah you know so i i wanted to shout out this this quote of buffett's that you mentioned in one of your your um your pieces which is be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful um why why did you shout that out and can you speak about that a little bit and maybe who knows when this airs it might be a bull run again but yeah but what what people should take away from that here in this bear market yeah so i mean it's just the the general uh thesis of that i think is that if you're investing with the mindset of invest evaluating projects for the long term and if a project has a good team they're building something and they have like quote unquote the fundamentals whatever the fundamentals are in the entity space we're still figuring that out but i think a good team is a big part of that um then obviously a lot of the space runs on sort of hype fomo um people seeing numbs go up and just wanting in on on the action but the sort of the secondary market prices doesn't really significantly impact the ability of the team and the project to execute on its vision and what it wants to do yes they get the more full price goes up the more volume there is they get a little more in secondary market royalties and stuff to keep them going but by and large they're running off the the funds they raise from the initial sale and they have a vision they're trying to execute on it so if the project is is going along nicely and then you know there's a bull market and a lot of people and you might get into the space they find these projects they're really hyped about them price goes up because people are really excited um i mean nothing is really fundamentally changed in the project itself like the team is still doing what it's going to do and it's sort of speculated saying hey i want to be in this project because i like what it's doing and then people are just competing with one another to pay more effectively say i'll pay 180 to get into this product you know how they won't provide you to get into this project and then again the fundamentals haven't changed but people just willing to pay more and i think in those cases it's just smart to take some profits take some money because inevitably there will be a market term there will be a sentiment shift um whatever reason or maybe if price is pumped like we've seen in the last few weeks if gas is really high people get a little spooked for whatever reason market sentiment will change and then people will be less excited to be in the project and that's when you know floor prices will will start to drop people will say hey i don't want i'm not as excited anymore i will sell this nft and i want the east because i think is going to go to 10k or whatever it may be and then and that's when you see sort of the market tanking people are undercutting the floor prices crash and then if they go really far down that's sort of when people are fearful and i think it's a really good buy opportunity because again nothing has changed in the project it's still essentially the same um and so you can get what i think are really good buys when the market is fearful when everyone's panicking when everyone's selling largely because the people that are selling either bought in just for the speculative aspect um and or because they didn't have sort of a long-term conviction in the project so i mean they're a project that i've brought in and they've gone up you know hundreds of percent and down 80 from their peak and i'm just sort of not bothered because i'm i can see that the team and the creators are building things that they're working on their project and they have a multi-year vision and i think that as the energy space explodes which i think it will over the next few years um the value will just naturally grow up go up and they'll find ways to you know build value and people will find the project and be willing to pay more to get involved so from that perspective i'm like not fast when prices go down a lot in these projects that i have conviction in but if someone is new to the space they didn't do their research they don't have conviction in the project when prices do go down then they panic then they want to sell then they worry that it's going to zero then they worry that you know no one will ever pay more for it and that's when people are fearful and that's i guess when when goodbyes can be made yeah yeah and short buy if the market's funding yes no gas is a little high right now no no that's great i think i think that's saying in a thousand no not at all it's all valuable i think it's funny to me because again i'm sort of i was i was raised professionally with that sort of long-term orientation you don't worry about the whims of the market on a particular day but these texts from my friends this morning or this text from my friend this morning kind of reminded me that not everybody else has that perspective and i think it's a really awesome thing to just keep reminding people like don't let your sense of of self or or well-being or you know be dictated by where the nft market is on any given day it's down today it'll be back up tomorrow if you believe in your projects don't dump because you're panicking um yeah hold on there is um i mean there is sort of money to be made and like an approach to take which is much more short-term minded and sort of like you can trade with the emotions of the market and swing trade so as it may be but if you are doing that i think it's important to understand that you are doing that and that you're playing an insanely risky game like crypto is risky investing and nfp's even more risky and yeah so most people don't have the stomach for it most people don't have the the knowledge or the um you know what whatever the wisdom to to be able to profitably know what's happening with the market and make these quick flips or some swing trades so for most people i recommend not trying that approach and not hoping to quick quickly flip things and yeah again go back to the more long-term minded i guess value invested investing approach do you have recommendations for people on where to start if they are even interested in flipping like you know where to source new projects what are the good spots to what are the good people to follow on on twitter other than yourself do you have uh do you ever recommend that to folks i get disaster a lot and i still don't have a good answer yeah i was headed to asics i'm like i don't think anyone does yeah that's the issue because well so much of it is sort of self-learning you just need to put in the time start following people on twitter see who you think makes sense and you jive with and um yeah jump into discords network talk to other people in the space like everyone is by and large very friendly and welcome welcoming and willing to share information and help one another out and sort of like yeah lift each other up but it takes time to just just wrap your head around the whole space and see what's going on and i think the number one piece of advice i give to anyone is just to be patient because it's so it's so enticing and just people want to just jump in and like want to buy an nft and if they buy one it's fun and exciting what about another one and they see people around them making you know massive gains but what they don't see because a lot of people don't publicize it is that the big losses and the mistakes um which are around a lot as well um yeah so i recommend to be patient and just take time it just takes time to just research yourself it gets called a rabbit hole for a reason right like it's a rabbit you just keep going down and down and down and down and you know hopefully eventually you hit that point where you start to get a feel for it but it takes you a while i mean i'm many months into this and i don't i don't feel like i'm there yeah the learning curve is steep and that's uh something that we need to improve upon and i think we are getting better at it and um yeah over time we'll have better resources and like a go-to place for people to go to to find and learn and educate themselves um yeah i know about some projects in the pipeline that are working on these things which is exciting so ooh anything you can share sure any secret alpha yeah uh i mean they're launching next next week so i don't know when this is going to come out but a project i'm advising on is called curious addies trading club and it's they're effectively their goal is to build sort of like the duro lingo for crypto and nfts so an app that you know beginners can learn understand what gas is what ethereum is how to transact what an nft is everything basically in an easy to you know just a gamified way because that's fun and stuff um and it's back like the two co-founders of husband and wife team who have had tremendous success working on other startups um the the husband ben is a a feel feel fellow from um so he dropped out of harvard you got that yeah peter thiel yeah yeah and um yes so they've had a lot of success they know what they're doing they've built apps and they're they want to basically create this basic go-to place for new people to crypto and nfts and you know it'll take them a while to build the app and be out on the market but it's yeah that's exciting for me because i would love to say like we all have friends saying hey you're into nfts how do you get in and you're like where do i start oh okay maybe um go to youtube watch it watch these videos here's an article that i found and ask me questions and it's like it's not scalable but just say hey go to this website look at this app download this out great so that's really exciting to me yeah there's the like the macro and then the micro it's like well let me first explain to you we're trying to convince you that this is a legitimate thing then step two is trying to start directing you places and it's it's really a challenge so speaking of learning uh something you've written a lot about that i'm i'm eager to learn more about and i imagine a lot of other people are as well is art blocks i'm familiar with art blocks i know it's basic breakdown but i think there are a lot of people who are newer to the space who maybe aren't and you've written about it i think really eloquently so first can you give the the brief overview if somebody doesn't know of like what art blocks is and sort of how it's broken down between playground and curated and factory and etc sure so art blocks is a a platform where generative artists can release their work and so generative art is basically art that is created by code so the artist will they won't just you know use it they won't use photoshop they won't use pen and paper they'll they'll write some code and the code itself will generate the arts they can you know code in the color they can code in circles and you know all that kind of stuff and uh they're able to make extremely sophisticated things and pieces of work that look visually appealing and aesthetic and just nice pieces of art but rather than them creating themselves they're generated by the code this is a generative art has been a thing for 50 years you know even before computers people were finding ways to generate art without you know physically creating each piece but um obviously as technology has improved and gotten better and code coding has gotten better people have created more sophisticated versions of generative art but there had never really been a good way to sell it to capture it and create value out of it because essentially the artist could just run what they would do before art blocks and for nfts where they they run their algorithm a thousand times or ten thousand times look through all the outputs and pick out like ten that they like the best and then they would just sell them as as prints or like digital images but there was no again no true digital ownership over it with nfts and blockchain technology what can happen is that and what does happen with our blocks is that the artist will upload their code to the blockchain so it'll be permanently and forever stored on chain and the user will go to the artboard website and when they want to buy a piece they they click the mint button and it uses the sort of the the hash code so like each the the the seed free oh not speak phrase but like the seed from the transaction so each person who you know they have a unique ethereum wallet at a certain time it inputs it and the the code runs and the output is you know a generative piece of art based on this code but the output is unique so no one else will have the same output and the artist themselves don't know what the outputs are going to be until people click that button until it is generated in real time and in real time it is saved to the blockchain it is this piece of art this nft that's created um it is all stored effectively all on chain so it's not like a lot of other projects um you buy an nft and it's sort of the actual image file isn't stored on the ethereum blockchain just because it's prohibitively expensive to store that much data but without blocks the code is on chain and effectively everything to recreate it is on chain so art blocks can disappear the website can go down they could pack up and leave tomorrow and as long as the ethereum blockchain is around um more or less people will be able to recreate their art i mean okay there's usually a couple of other dependencies like a javascript package called p5.js i think which is a generative art package but for all intents and purposes that package itself is as decentralized as the ethereum network like it's it's the code is like locked in a cold storage locker under a mountain in norway or something like that and it's like in you know thousands of people's computers and it's like yeah it you will be able to recreate your art whenever you want so it's like true ownership in the truest sense and yeah so artblocks is this platform where artists launch their their projects on their users and collectors can go and buy them and create and find out what they get like again no one really knows exactly what they're going to get by clicking the mint button so it's a bit of a fun experience and yeah they've launched a couple hundred projects now and they sort of split their their platform up into three different areas so it's a curated collection the playground and the factory curated is basically what it sounds like so the artblocks team themselves will go through all their applications and curate and select the ones they think are the best or the most interesting or unique or whatever it may be and release them under this flagship collection and you know they're restricted to one one a week at most you like lately it's been a few weeks since we had the last one to sort of like restrict the supply and keep quality high and you know they go through a curation board and so it's very prestigious to release under that and then any artist that has released a curated piece can sort of release a project in the playground which as it sounds like it's just a place for them to try new things experiment play and create new art and you know they can launch one project a month there effectively and then the factory is just sort of everything else so if if you're a generative artist you can apply and maybe you don't want to go through the curation process which can take months maybe even years now to actually have your work on our blogs in the curator's section or maybe you're just newer to the space or you don't have the you know your work isn't as uh unique or advanced or whatever to to necessarily pass curation but it's still generative art it's still cool interesting and it passes like a lower bar of curation and that's where the factory comes in and they release multiple projects a week there and it's a lot more affordable as well like for curating the prices now you know several each usually um maybe less now because of the bear market but one to two weeks at least whereas in the factory you can get like 0.18 for example so now's the time to buy art blocks so you're very bullish on it and you've written about art blocks specifically a couple of times why are you so bullish on art blocks generative art can be created anywhere what it is about an art blocks stamped piece that that you find so exciting yeah so i'm i would say i'm very bullish on generative art as a whole so there's going to be very successful generative art there has been not on our blocks as well created elsewhere um other platforms other individual artists releasing it but i just think that generative art as a medium is this is just going to explode over the next several years decades even because it's just the perfect uh vessel or like this you know this point where art and coding and technology and culture all meet and it it's a thing that wasn't really possible again before blockchain technology and it was sort of still in the early days i think of real what they call long-form generative art where you know you can create 500 or a thousand uh iterations or something and sell them and so yeah very bullish on generative art in the long term and uh i was actually sidetracked i was talking to someone a couple of days ago who is who has created a platform for kids to learn generally about and so um you know it's sort of like a learning course you can you know i think it's ages 5-17 or something they go on they click what their interests are and then it really takes them to the basic steps it's like copy and paste like tells you the basic code it's like write this in and it'll create like a square that's colored and then you can add a ball to it and you can move it as like you know really teaching the next generation of generative artists and and like i think that's going to be bigger is that like an online thing or that that's in germany somewhere it feels like that's the kind of thing that europe is going to catch on to before the united states like no no no this is an american thing oh wow yeah yeah yeah it's um this should definitely probably be start being like the school curriculums themselves we nee you know a much heavier focus on generative art and on computer science and nfts and crypto in general and yeah we'll get there in 100 years once it's past the time yeah we're getting there and i guess to get back to it generative art very bullish art blocks it's just already a massive well-established brand in the generative art space they have tons of artists that are you know many of them very well respected probably all of them i mean i don't know them all specifically but um and and yeah there's tons of people that have really fallen in love with the art and found personal connections with the art and the artists and the platform and i know that the team the creator of snowflower eric is he has a really long term vision like he wants to build out our blocks and just essentially encourage this whole generative art movement for from not just a collector's or financial or investment point of view um he's more focused on the arts and you know making that explode and i think that's really important and you know again they're building for decades not just the next month or a year so i'm bullish on the whole ecosystem on juno is your new crypto enabled financial

special thanks to overpriced jpeg partner blockblock not only because they are a sponsor of this show but also because they are my employer blockblock is an innovative blockchain lab we work across nfts and the metaverse and our goal is really to push the industry forward with every new project we take on we founded and currently run the kneebits down which just partnered with larval labs to create more metaverse friendly renderings of meet its which is awesome we are also partnered with a sundance award-winning filmmaker to build the first dow that will own a feature-length documentary film we have a ton of cool projects down the pipeline and are really looking for cool people to partner with on this so go to blockblock.io to subscribe to our newsletter and be kept up to date about what we have going on and also to check out open roles we have available we'd love to have you apply come work with me coming out blockblock.io you taught me the term in your writing via your writing uh i'm not going to pronounce it probably correctly but vablin or vablin goods okay and and this gets to the piece you're talking about with branding which is the art block's name has really started to establish itself as a well-known brand in this space which of course comes with power and this therefore it's able to create this dynamic of a of a veblen good why don't you explain to folks what that means and what that is sure so traditionally with uh markets like we all know that supply and demand if something is in low supply and in high demand it's very valuable and then if supply goes up um the the existing supply and total supply generally goes down in value just because you know there's more of it to go around and the demand might not be matching it with a veteran good it again i'm not an expert i i found out about it not too far before i wrote that piece but um effectively it's uh it goes against that and it suggests that as in some cases as supply goes up price can also go up because it's sort of the brand power and like a good example of that is say a rolex watch like there are or whatever you know a louis vuitton bag or whatever luxury good that there might be they're it's not like they're restricted in supply anyone can whenever they want go out go to a shop and buy one you know they're pumping out thousands tens of thousands i don't know how many exactly hundreds of thousands maybe a year um but because they are considered a luxury brand already um it's sort of as a new person buys in and and gets one they they feel like they have this luxury good they have whatever social status that they may be looking for by getting it um and then now all of a sudden this person is an advocate for the brand they're part of the network they they themselves will probably be talking it up and saying hey you know rolex's i have one they're really cool hey and you know other people will see that and it's sort of yeah it goes against the traditional supply and demand but i think that in a way our blocks may at least outbox curated maybe all of our blocks will be that way where in the future um the case i mean it even is still now but like if someone owns a piece of art blocks curated it's sort of like considered a luxury item obviously it's thousands and thousands of dollars in multiple ether to own one and they keep releasing more but it's not really hurting the value i don't think of art blocks created it's just you know more of the same luxury good being released and i think you made this point sort of as a uh a response to people who were like oh because there continue to be new art block exhibitions and new artists is there going to be an over supply problem with art blocks that's going to hurt them in the long run and i think we in the nfc community maybe are so wired for like there's only ten thousand right there's this ten thousand drop the idea that something is going to continue to be produced over many years like freaks us out and i think that's the that's the wrong perspective first of all ten thousand is so tiny like there are going to be so many more people that flood into this space so like supply i don't think is is is at all an issue right now we need to be worried about um but i think that point of like if you're if you establish a strong enough brand and establish yourself as a luxury good you are less subject to the to those kinds of wins so the supply and demand wins yeah so i want to make sure we talk about your project i think it's really exciting you have announced you are launching your first nft project you mentioned this earlier said you're excited to kind of get out of the flipping game and start building something talk to me about the project sure so it is uh effectively the nft or the token is going to be a membership token so you'll get access to largely my my discord server and so i i created this discord server two or three months ago now and it was free and anyone could join and i sort of always intended it for it to be free like i even had in the back of my mind yes i may launch an ft in the future maybe you'll get access to a couple of private channels within the discord but the whole discord will be free and over the last maybe two three weeks ago i sort of changed my mind and decided to make the entire discord sort of gated and you need the nfc to get in although anyone who was in at the time which was like 11 000 people i said you know you're here you support me early you have lifetime access basically so i didn't want to you know make anyone who had found it have to pay but the biggest reason for wanting to make the whole discord gated as it is is that um like the entity space is so wild west ian to create a term um it's full of scammers and bad actors and like especially on discord people are joining servers and like dming people with malicious links and posting links in the discord and we had a case a few weeks ago where three accounts joined three or four and then one one of them posted a link to a project saying hey this is minting now it's really cool and the other ones were jumping in and saying hey i admitted something that looks really cool and so you know one of our members thought this was just genuine conversation they went to the site minted and lost a little bit of each on this scam project and you know obviously i hate to see that and by getting it and having this sort of higher barrier entry which is not that i mean the the base token is going to cost 0.033 each so it's like it's reasonable i think for lifetime access to a discord um yeah so i think that will eliminate a ton of scammers and that kind of thing and the other thing is it will just sort of um make the whole discord more cohesive rather than having two different sections gated and stuff like that for the majority everyone will get in and so yeah this is a membership token um 99 of people so i have two different price tiers but this is the one that i think 99 of people will be interested in 0.033 eth and the drop mechanic will be the um it'll be an open edition so there's no restriction on the amount that i'm going to sell but it'll be open for two weeks so you know anyone can wait for gas to be low if they want in they can wait take their time mint um if they want to make multiple maybe they can give it to friends in the future or if they think it'll go up in value in the future they can do that but um yes this avoids any sort of gas war any sort of white listing necessary and it's not like i'm selling a rare commodity it's not like uh every nft is going to be exactly the same so it's just going to be a digital letter written by me with some text a fundable non-fundable token yeah uh erc 1155 for the the technical ones out there yeah that is basically what it's going to be and so yeah everyone will be effectively the same but it's just like a membership card to to the discord i want to get into the second tier as well but before so what's going on in your discord like sell your like you know what what's what's the haps happening in the in the zenica discord uh is there yes awesome people good insight what are we getting there it's all of that it's just a really good community it's tons of people that are i mean friendly and and willing to help and share information and learn about the space um i we have like an alpha channel which a lot of sports have now where people post about mints going on in real time and try and share information but i'm trying to make the focus not so much on like what's happening right now in short some alpha but sort of create this greater environment of education and sharing knowledge and researching longer term projects and so i post like occasionally uh i'll do deep research into the project and post the breakdown hey i think this is good this is coming up or this project that had launched a while back is is maybe a little on the radar it's worth looking into obviously i i don't recommend anyone buy anything i don't give financial advice i just do some research and share some of it and i mean that's part of it but a lot of it is just like it's just another community to hang out and be around like-minded people who are there to learn and like are really here for the long run not not like there's so many communities out there which um i mean hey i mean people like them as well but they're all focused on the short term flipping they're talking about like this is minting right now let's get in let's get on the way let's flip it and then you know move on to the next project whereas mine is hopefully more like a chill calm environment and that is the community that i provide that i'm fostering um and yes i i with the size of the community and with money raised i i hope to bring value in other avenues whether it's you know discounts to analytics tools or whatever it may be um but again like i hate road maps i'm not plan promising anything i'm just saying hey if you buy in you get access to the discord and we'll try and do cool things together um yeah and that that segways me to the second tier i'll tee off the second tier by saying i loved something you wrote about it which is you realize this is expensive and i'm not offering that much correct or some variation on that which is a a wonderful wonderful way to sell your own project i actually think it is really effective but it's hilarious so i want to talk about why you wanted to emphasize that and but let's start with with what is the second tier that you're you're launching yeah so i mean first tier unlimited 0.033 available to most the second tier is basically much more exclusive it is 3.33 eth and restricted to 333. you can tell i have a thing with the threes it's everyone asks when i created my twitter account i was 33 years old so i had 33 my name and then i just ran with it and uh i think i'm still 33. um i forget my age anyway you created your first twitter account this year or within this this i created this twitter account i had one from back when i was an online poker player for a while it had like two thousand followers and it didn't really yeah i didn't really use twitter that much um now you have like a hundred thousand followers right no big deal it's stupid but yeah it's growing fast it is growing fast which i think is a testament to whole space growing so so much because it's a testament to youtube though i think you you give you do long threads so for anybody who doesn't follow zenica 33 that's his handle i really like you you give thoughtful threads which i enjoy on twitter more than like snarky one-liners so i think you're providing real value for people that way yeah okay so 3.33 oh sorry 3.338 and restricted to 333 and basically what i'm saying is that the access to a more private discord so within the private school there'll be one channel that's just the 333 of us or maybe a few channels um and it'll basically be more access to me i'll spend more time in there and i will yeah it's just my time and so i was sort of going back and forth on whether i wanted to include this or not and then what really sort of i guess pushed me over the edge was that a couple of weeks ago i decided i wanted to start advising and consulting for projects and i created this google form for people to fill out if they wanted to you know bring me on to their team and i had 80 responses in 36 hours and uh on the forum i'm saying my fee is six percent of initial sale revenue which for most projects is going to be like between 30 and 68 which is obviously a ludicrous amount of money and this many people were still willing to pay it and then after the 36 hours had ended i got another like 50 messages for people saying i missed it you know can we still work on that etc um so effectively people are willing to pay for my time and find some value in it and i mean i want to help people i want to work with projects i want like when people message me you know if we go back a month ago or six weeks ago i would answer everyone and try and help them out your feedback but it's gotten to the point now where i just literally don't have the time to do that i can't look at every project that people message me about so this nft is sort of one way that you know if you're launching a project if you want a little bit more of my time you want some opinion that you can you know buy this get access to discord chat with me and i will be much more able to level and willing to um you know look at your your whatever you're launching but um i mean that's one reason to get in or that people might want in the other is just if they want this to be it's like the community will be small and it'll be hopefully with like-minded people i'm sort of curating the the community myself because i put out a google form for anyone that wants to jump on the white list to to buy it and like i i wasn't sure if it would sell out if there'd be that much interest and then i got like a thousand responses in 24 hours so yeah just before this call i was going through and i had a field on the forum saying why do you want to be in uh in the community or why why do you want to pay this much money basically and what's wrong with you yeah it is so much money it really blows my mind like to think of how much money it's going to raise and i need to figure out what um what i'm going to do with the door because i mean there's no denying if it sells out which is seeming like it will it'll be like a thousand eth just from this tier you know four million dollars and that's a ton of money and i i don't know what i'm gonna do with it but i need to be thoughtful about it and think about it and like what what i can say is i'm not like i'm not gonna just create a token and pump it back into the like it's not a project where i'm saying hey i'm gonna build this thing i'm not gonna i don't have i'm not an artist i'm not a game developer i'm not trying to create a dow or anything like that it's like the in essence people are paying me for the access and the time and it's that kind of thing but it does give me the ability to do cool and interesting things that again i'm not putting it in any road map but i i don't know i commission artists to create cool art and air drop to people create buy like metaverse land and have clubhouses and i mean it's just collabs with whatever there are a lot of possibilities and i just i don't know what i'm gonna do with it but i i um it's something i need to think about of course but yeah so i get to go through this this list of people that have applied to be whitelisted and i curate the list a bit and hopefully put together a group of people that are right there for the right reasons and then part of the value will be this network effect where you know you have these uh this group of people that are either they're new and learning and want to learn and have you know maybe they have expertise from outside the entity space that they can impart or you have someone that's launching a project and wants some insight and you know can help other people in the future anyway there's so many possibilities but yeah it's a bit of an experiment and that that's that's what it is and i'm excited for it because you know it does it will give me the financial freedom to not feel like i need to flip not feel like i need to be buying and selling nfts and i can focus on again helping others and spreading um i guess information and education and that kind of stuff yeah i think the reality is not to show for your project for you but but you know thirteen thousand dollars right whatever this sort of lands at who knows if heath is 10k by the time this launch is a little bit more but is is um is not unreasonable at all for like lifelong consulting services you know like consultants charge a lot of money and there's no as long as you hold this token you have that access right so i think i mean heck twelve thousand dollars is not a lot for a month of consulting services um so you know if if you're somebody who's looking for a really strong consultant i mean i could see this being a huge win for like not that you necessarily want to pick these folks but like for institutions right like who are trying to get into this space and and that's um that's practically cheap if you're them right i'm sure you're targeting sort of individuals that you wanna you wanna bring in but yeah um i think that that 3.33 can be initially like oh my gosh whoa because we're so used to drops where it is more like 0.05 or 0.03 or whatever but when you when you frame it for what you are offering as much as you joke that it's not much it really is something and then the other piece that i'm interested in is this network effects uh part so i get a lot of questions and i'm sure you get even more questions than i do about hey i'm an artist i want to get started in the space i see the opportunity but i don't really know how to to take a break through and it strikes me that one of the biggest advantages an artist can have is other networked connections within the nft artist space um i'm curious if you would agree with that and you know you feel like maybe it's worth spending a bunch of time getting to know other artists in the space who can kind of be your network effects when you launch um and b how much you're thinking about that with this community that you're building yeah i 100 agree that it's incredibly important the network effects i think just for anyone in this space like whatever your goal is if you want to succeed in the nft space networking is probably the number one thing to do and you know networking sort of has this businessy ishfi where it's like you go these events and suits and conferences and you chat to people network but in the nft space it's a lot more fun it's like you just chat with people on twitter you join discords and you vibe and you know you have fun and you talk about cool jpegs and crazy madness is going on in the space like someone refusing nine million dollars for their punk or you know whatever coinbase is launching their marketplace and there's just you can talk about tons of stuff and you just make friends and like everyone is so friendly you network and then you know if you are launching your project if you are an artist and you have friends and communities then that's these are the people that will be there to support you and yeah i really don't think any i can understand how important the network effect is and just how important it is to network um obviously you can be successful and you can't find success by just being like a passive person in space just lurking if you don't want to talk to people you can use you know research and be on on the outskirts and still find success by investing in stuff but it's definitely harder and especially if you're an artist trying to sell your work trying to spread the word then again networking is is key um and i forgot part two you know i think you you addressed it it sounds like that part two was is do you have that in mind as you're curating this list of uh of the 333 who you'll let it in yeah because it strikes me too as i'm once again explaining why this is not an overpriced jpeg that you were selling here uh roy slash senica i think you know 12 000 is also not a wildly aggressive marketing budget if you're launching a brand and yeah i do think artists should think of i think a lot of artists do think of their nfts as a brand or should oftentimes depending on the kind of art your project you're dropping and it shilling for your project in like a random discord where there's 12 000 people is is not always necessarily going to be the most effective way to go about it i think there's a way people could think about this as a marketing expense for their project of hey i'm going to be in this intimate group of 333 people who this person i trust has sort of handpicked so that i think are going to be good people to have meaningful relationships with who are maybe meaningful people to talk about my project out publicly if my project is good right i know you've been clear i'm not just going to market your your thing because you buy this yeah um but you know 12 000 is not a crazy marketing expense for a brand um yeah and a way to build build a a meaningful network um yeah i i do yeah i mean it's it's hard to say that i think it will be worth it or the value is there but uh and i really don't think anyone should be buying it if it's a significant amount of their their net worth like if if they only have 10 eth if they not only it's a lot of money but if that's what they have then spending three or 3.38 on this may not make sense like it may be a longer term thing and the value that they may get from the group will you know be smaller non-tangible i mean certainly non-tangible um but yeah if you're a project launching you if you have you know you're an individual with hundreds thousands of eth at your disposal then it makes i think some sense so what is the biggest piece of advice uh you would give to a new artist wanting to launch a project i'm sure this is the question you get all the time do you have like one piece of advice either to an artist or to to an investor one of the two or both yeah uh i mean the advice is probably the same and one part is what we just said network and just you know make these connections but the the biggest piece of advice i think i give everyone is just be patient and realize that it takes time to find success in this space usually yes people do get overnight success and there are these edge cases but they are edge cases and outliers and the exceptions and for everyone that has overnight success there's dozens hundreds that do not um thousands maybe and um realize that it's very exciting the nft space there there's a lot of money to be made there's a lot of other success to be found but uh it's not going anywhere the tech and the space is going to be here for forever for a very very long time and we're very very very early just because it's exciting and fun and looks great you don't need to jump in and buy an nft today or tomorrow you don't have to launch your nfc if you're an artist today or tomorrow take some time build up a community um you know have a network talk to friends or just you know soak in information and research and so that when you do go to say invest or buy into a project you know why you're doing it so you have the conviction in the long term so that you can hold and you know survive these bear markets which i think is important and not necessarily panic and freak out and text your friends in the morning about it um that that's one thing or if you want to play the aggressive flipping high-risk game understand that you are doing that and again that you may be losing a ton of money you could you could go to zero and only you know risk money that you afford to lose but the issue comes in when people are impatient and then they just jump head first in not really sure what they're doing you know they just want to get involved right away which i can understand that is cool and exciting and fun and you know it's all happening but yeah people feel like they're going to miss out that they're they're late already and they want to jump in yeah there's so much firmware but um you're not late you're early even if you listen to this in two years you're probably still early like we have a long journey ahead of us like decades um think internet in 1995. it's not like you were late if you go to the internet game in 2002 no you're not so i think we have plenty of time ahead of us just think about learning and invest in yourself educate yourself yeah yeah you threw you embedded within that uh the one i was going to say which was don't don't play with more than you can afford to lose which which you were getting at with if you have 10 eth don't spend three of it on on this project um it's i don't know if it was you or somebody else i saw on twitter who was like if you have a stomachache after you bought something like you spent too much was that you no it wasn't that it sounds like something i would like sounds like something you would say yeah it was like hey if you have a stomach if you can't sleep at night because you're stressed about the move you just made i've said this the sleep thing before but yeah okay so maybe i'm completing two different ones yeah yeah yeah yeah but that doesn't make sense did you have any moments of that when you were early in this space where you overextended and it was like that learning moment of like oh yep okay that's i went across the line for myself yeah yeah yeah i definitely had a few moments like that where [Music] yeah i guess i did overextend because i i couldn't really sleep or i was just too like i invested in a couple of projects and then i sold them for profit but then they went up and like five or 10x and i was like agonizing over it which i mean that's it's to happen in this space you just can't time the top or the bottom whatever um yeah i learned from those and over time have i guess started to yeah invest less or like less as a percentage of my overall uh bankroll or portfolio and more towards projects against that have conviction in the all of those moments where i was had like a sinking feeling in my stomach or i couldn't sleep or whatever it was always because i didn't have conviction in the projects i was investing in and yeah i will say i i've had a moment and i i feel confident saying i've learned from it i'm somebody who again comes from a bit of a finance background i know you should never play with money you can't afford to lose but that means different things to different people what you can afford to lose means different things different people and i i went a little too far like totally swept up in fomo i was in a discord the whole discord was like going like you know it was sort of the the price was rising everybody was like getting each other so hyped up and so i i went in a little harder than i should have been like right at the peak right right starts coming back down it's it's since gone back i actually did have long-term conviction in the project so i was able to handle it but like i had the stomachache like i i went to bed i woke up the next morning just feeling so embarrassed that i'd like fallen prey to the hype cycle on a discord channel so this is to say like it happens you know again god do we know what the project was oh i'm almost yeah okay i'll say it because i love it i actually i love this project it's creatures so it was like great i love creatures i'm such a longer but i bought in the first time it went up i bought it at like 1.5 and then like 1.85 which is it's over that now and i think it'll go higher like i really believe but like i bought a few like at the time it was just like like 10 000 or whatever it was and i was like that's more than i feel comfortable and then it was like right before it went back down like point seven i was like okay yeah yeah it was also learning from me it was like kevin rose had just made his profile picture i think gary vaynerchuk had just said something about it so it was it was a moment for me to learn like right after a bunch of celebs start talking about a project is when you're probably going to have a little like short term peak so like just like take a breath yeah yeah yeah we saw the same when uh i think it was shaq made a crazy square focus and luckily i was already holding it yeah yeah yeah that's when i bought it as soon as that happened because i was like okay this is i already thought the project was cool i was planning to buy in a day or two before but then i saw this i was like all right i'm i should get it now yeah yeah and again i i think i only buy into projects that i i have a long-term conviction because i haven't learned how to flip yet i may never um but that was a case where it was like you took it a little too far i probably shouldn't spent that much um awesome all right we're running low on time here the last thing i wanted to address because i think it's really interesting is um you you so richard who's an influencer in the space kind of famously recently did not sell his crypto punk for like nine million dollars or eight million dollars or something right 9.5 i think 9.5 okay yeah and you retweeted his his tweet about it saying i'll get it exactly like when we say nfts are different because institutions can't just come and buy them this is what we mean some things are just not for sale can you explain that a little bit more or maybe explain to people who are new to this space like what what that says about the culture and the sort of ethos in nfts and why it's interesting yeah so nfts are at least up until now everything that's been sold it's sort of like the ownership is distributed amongst the community amongst real people people especially in the case of crypto punks that were here like ogs in the space early and um compare it to sort of most other basically every other crypto investment like coins or even financial stocks and stuff like that um if a big institution wants to get involved and into the space they can just come along and they can just buy a ton of bitcoin or ethereum or selana or whatever and then they just have a significant portion of the market and even at the beginning stages they often funded by you know vc investors angel investors and seed rounds and private sales and publix and then eventually you know the rest of us the the the what's the word uh you know lay people lay people yeah yeah yeah regular casual investors or uh there's a world retail retail investors retail there we go yeah yeah we are usually stuck having to buy later on and then price may tank because the institutions you know decide hey we're just going to sell off a ton today and then you know it's just like that isn't really a case with nfts at least at the moment if if an institution comes in and they want to buy a ton like they want to invest a billion dollars into crypto punks or apes or whatever it's like they just they can't they have to pay what we who hold the entities are willing to sell for and in the case of richard he's just said my punk is not for sale so that means that it's not a case of hey we're gonna offer you a billion dollars but it's just not for sale and if enough of us say it is not for sale then we get to keep the integrity of our community we get to have it decentralized in our hands um and for the ones that who that do decide to sell they get to dictate the price they say okay it's not for sale unless you give me you know a 100 million dollars or whatever it might be um and then it's yeah so if the institutions want to get in a make them pay and b if you don't want to sell don't sell like my profile picture eight is just not for sale i've i've created an identity with it it's it's a brand now i have a podcast called two board apes of you know it's just it's for better or worse is now my avatar for for the metaverse for the nft space and it probably will be forever i mean maybe i'll find something a lot more in the future but if someone comes along and offers me double floor price for it i'm not going to sell because hey someone comes off to be 9.5 million dollars i will say logan okay you hear that who what who was it with like visa or mastercard or whoever was trying to buy it um oh yeah okay yeah but um yeah right xyz if you're listening um but yeah by and large it's like nfts are hours you can say it's not for sale you can say it's not for sale unless you pay me this much and they just can't come in and invest how much they want to into buying it up in a way that they can in many other industries and get control of them yeah i think that that is a one of the big reasons i was drawn to this space is this underdog contrarian in me and i think this this dynamic is sort of a microcosm of what's happening sort of broadly right now which is there's this increasing tension between like individuals and institutions and institutions are are crumbling in some ways and i think you saw that play out with like the melvin capital like wall street bets dynamic where there was a whole bunch of us kind of being like go ready so read it and i think this is um yeah and this is the this is an economic sort of extension of that which is very cool the the last anecdote i'll share to this point is um i i don't want to get myself in trouble but recently my uh my company was sort of not i'm not a founder but was approached by this kind of institution who's trying to get into the space and who wanted whales to help them like they know whales are important they wanted them to like help you know push and market this nft they were dropping and it was like that's not how this works right like you can't just come and like swing around a bunch of money and think that the whales have money right like that's either whales like they what they value more than your money is their kind of independence and in many ways i think reputational integrity around that they've built up around this space and so i think that's a really kind of beautiful thing it was kind of fun to like tell this boardroom of like corporate white guys like your money's no good here it's it's not you can't you can't buy the marketing in the same way in this space you have to network your way to it so awesome roy zenika i keep calling you both this was so fun i i really really appreciate you taking this time and really excited for your project to launch i think it is not
