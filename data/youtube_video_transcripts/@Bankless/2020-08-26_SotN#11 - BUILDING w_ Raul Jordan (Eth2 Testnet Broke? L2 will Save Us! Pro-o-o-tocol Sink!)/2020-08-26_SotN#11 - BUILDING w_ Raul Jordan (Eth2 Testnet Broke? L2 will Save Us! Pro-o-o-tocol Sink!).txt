hey everyone welcome to state of the nation this is episode 11 our 11th episode of state of the nation david how are you doing today i'm doing just fantastic i stepped away for a whole four days and it uh it cost me in my ability to understand what the hell is going on but you know for four days is like probably four weeks at least like in the real world yeah yeah it's an insane amount of time um but i've spent most of yesterday trying to get back on track and i think i think i'm there i don't think i'm there awesome man well i'm excited we've got some great topics we've got a very special guest raul jordan he is from the prismatic labs team and we're going to introduce him in just a minute but if you're not familiar with state of the nation what we do every single episode is we broadcast this live on tuesdays now so tuesday is at 10 a.m eastern time we're pushing this live you can ask questions in the comments but we have some some prepared content that we we talked about and what we really try to do is talk about what's happening relate to all of the big picture stuff that is going on encrypted going on in the bankless nation we try to drop some insights and action items every single episode so you are constantly leveling up like using the events that have gone on the previous week to level up so every tuesday we drop this on youtube we also release it on our podcast stream on wednesdays so if audio is more your gm you want to catch this while you're going for a jog whatever catch it on wednesdays that way as well david before we dive in we should talk about our fantastic sponsors you want to start with gods and jane yeah god's unchanged i love having gods unchained as a sponsor so for for those of you guys that have played magic the gathering or yu-gi-oh or pokemon or hearthstone gaz and chain is it is a game just like that it's a trading card game where you kind of duel with another person and some hopefully your cards are better than theirs but they're interesting about god's thing about gauze and chain is that the cards are digital tokens on ethereum and and so there's there's the the magic the gathering game is great because you can play in real life with physical cards that you own yourself kind of in the same way that you own cash and then you can play right across from another person hearthstone from blizzard is also great because you can play on your computer and you can play anywhere in the world and because it's on your computer there are some extra cool mechanics that you just can't have in in real life except you don't own your cards and so like blizzard has complete control over your cards if you lose your account you lose all your cards gaz and chained is like the best of both worlds where your cards are tokens on ethereum and so you actually own your assets right like no one can take your gauze and train cards away from you but you can also play on a computer with these cool like awesome graphics and these cool awesome game mechanics because of how it's a digital game so you can check them out at god's unchained and you can also play against me every weekend or so i usually play on the weekends play against you yeah mistake are you like really good at this uh i could be better all right well then i might take advantage of that i also want to tell you about sponsor number two so ave is a long-term supporter uh of bankless just a fantastic protocol ave is a lending and borrowing protocol deployed on ethereum some weeks i feel like i can't even keep up with everything these guys are putting out and everything these guys are doing they might be competing competing for it like the team that ships the most the d5 protocol team that the most because they're just crushing it um last yesterday actually i saw ave um not only last week or the week before they passed the one billion locked mark but they actually became the number one defy protocol uh in terms of total locked values so i'm looking at the d5 pulse charts right now and they are number one number 1.44 billion locked in ave right now i think the bankless nation might have a a portion of that and they're just ahead of maker at uh who's at 1.43 billion dollars so if you're new to ave what can you fit you can deposit die in the protocol or other ethereum based assets that you have like eth or other 20s and it returns interest on top of that deposit you can also borrow against it and ave has fixed rate loans they're also rolling out avonomics you can take a look at go to ave.com and see what avonomics is all about um they also have un uh uncollateralized len that they are deploying and developing we wrote an article about this in bankless um and recently actually yesterday they just rolled out a um a way to start onboarding fiat at least in the in the in the uk directly into the abbe protocol so this team's doing a lot it's a it's a protocol if you're if you're new to d5 it's very easy to use you should definitely check it out go to ave.com to do that all right those are sponsors david we should get to our main topic today oh actually before that just some quick announcements um antonio from dydx he's doing ama with us on thursday at 2 p.m eastern so catch that here live on the bankless youtube channel we'll also be releasing a test net guide for the we'll talk about how to say this in a minute but the medasha test testnet which is the newest eth2 uh test net um so that's something else you can check out on the podcast we had uh an episode with haseeb yesterday which was just absolutely um incredible and we've got an episode from framework ventures tomorrow that we're recording will come live on monday so always lots going on in the bankless nation bankless community the way to keep up with that is subscribe to the newsletter at banklist.substance.com all right let's get to topic one and this is all about the madosha test net and uh we're gonna beam raul jordan in here who is from the prismatic labs team so prismatic if you're not familiar with them they've developed an eth2 client that is live on the test net called prism and raoul is going to help us understand like what the testnet is and everything that's been going on because last week as i understand it was a pretty active week in eth 2.0 test net territory raul uh if you can hear me how are you doing today sir hey ryan uh and david doing great thank you invite and uh yeah excited to dive into this episode awesome okay well let's let's do first things first so um how do you pronounce it is it is it the medalla testnet is it the medasha testnet is it something else how do we pronounce this thing raul you're the expert yeah so this is going to be controversial but you know in argentina they say but in the rest of the rest of the spanish speaking world uh two l's uh amount to a y sound so you call it melaya so that's a stick you know to stick to the origin story i'm going to call it madaga and i will just go from there i've always learned that 2l's is a y and when i saw mariano conti pronounce it medasha i was like is this not spanish like i thought i thought i knew what spanish was and turns out turns out my inclination was right yeah turns out all right so um can we start here raul so uh what is this test the midasha testnet like why why do we have it um why you know how far are we is this it's like the last test net can you give us some context for what it is people have been waiting you know obviously a super long time to proof of stake um everything that we've had up to this point uh has mostly been either like glorified devnets or like smaller experiments that people have we have yet to created succeed a large-scale test net in which the the public can participate um at the same scale as mainnet so you know we want we want to have everything the same as it would look with real money but using money is basically a combination of years of work and creating a public uh you know kind of large-scale multi-client test net that means that there are multiple implementations of ethereum 2.0 not just our teams but also there are five teams that are currently on the test net so that's a really remarkable milestone uh most other blockchain projects typically have either one you know just one canonical implementation and you know we'll chat more about why having five is important here but that's that's kind of what the testnet is and it's had tremendous participation from the community um it's pretty much entirely by the community so not the theorem foundation nor the client teams own a large stake in the in the test net gotcha all right so um some events went down last week right so this test net has been live for a couple of weeks maybe a few weeks maybe but last week was a particularly active week can you tell us what happened yeah so you know as as it is a test uh you know the goal of it is to find bugs before we go live with real money so we want to make sure that you know if something breaks it breaks right now and not when a real ether is at stake so what happened was we had probably one of the worst case scenarios that could have happened um and what occurred was most of our nodes went down which were running a significant portion of the network at all at the same time so what that means is that most validators that were running those those nodes stopped validating and the testnet basically didn't have enough participation to basically what we call finalize which means that um you know a super majority of validators voted their eth and the chain is moving affected so what this means is people start losing and start basically bleeding money uh really quickly um there's a lot of a lot of stuff is happening in the network like nodes can't sync um all of this you know was distilled to a single a single uh catalyst that discovered a series of other bugs that led us to the state in which in which in which it was um so you know to give a high level overview what occurred was that you know people typically have uh you know this like essentially we we want nodes to be synchronized with uh with respect to their clock so um you know we want nodes across the world to have some sense of time that is somewhat consistent so as long as your clock is within around you know a few seconds um then you should be able to participate just fine as a validator what we were doing however was we were using we were basically adjusting the user's clock if it was off nice thing to do so for example like hey you know if your clock is off we're going to check with some cloud servers such as cloudflare and others and if your clock is off by a little bit we're gonna adjust it so it's just a nice thing to do for people you know it's it's totally not necessary uh however this proved to be the downfall because um you know one when when the time servers went crazy one of the time servers was saying that uh people's clocks were off by four hours so this means that people were creating blocks from the future and everyone else's reject was rejecting those um so you know and it's totally unnecessary like people always ask like oh that means e2 relies on a single point of failure which you know it's not that was our flawed assumption that we were making um so that wasn't it you know that wasn't the end of the problem so what happened after that was uh you know the problem stopped so the time servers uh fix themselves and everyone everything was fine but in the process we were we were desperate to push out a fix that basically uh didn't force users to change their clock and in doing this we actually pushed out a critical bug so we made things worse um so what happened with that with that with that fix that we did uh basically we told everyone hey restart your nodes and upgrade to the latest version the latest version was broken so nobody could sync and then all of our nodes were crazy um so what happens in this case is you know a big portion of the network is down um you know nobody can really sink to the chain head and when we when we actually fix the problem we told everyone hey the problem is ready it's the the issue is fixed um hey restart so what happens then if you tell everyone hey restart your node everyone is syncing with the chain at the same time so it's really hard to find somebody that is already synced so what this means is that you know you're like you're basically like finding a needle in a haystack of really bad nodes and like hey i want to sync the blockchain but nobody everyone else is trying to do the same thing wow um so it's a really hard situation to get out of uh because you know you you need somebody's synced and those were really rare so it you know the whole incident lasted probably around three or four days and throughout this entire time it became you know people were losing a lot of money uh people were upset and that's not all i think the biggest thing that happened from the incident was remember how i told you guys that people's clocks were off by four hours yeah so they were creating they were creating blocks from the future so here's what happened so it was 4 p.m central and your note was saying it was 8 p.m right so when you do if you do a double if you do a double block proposal that is conflicting or you do a double vote so basically that's something you're not supposed to do it's it's counted as that's it that's a really bad thing yeah it's called the slashing so essentially you know you at 4pm you created a block at 8pm which was invalid and then by the time 8pm was reached uh you already you know people saw that you already created a block at 8 pm so it was last like literally everyone was attempting to be slashed like every single node that was participating during that bug was gonna get slashed uh fortunately um you know our client ships with slashing protection so if you're running a node normally you know we keep track of the things that you've done before so you won't get slashed so a lot of people got saved by this but a lot of others didn't such as those that you know were running on like ephemeral cloud instances or stuff like that so yeah it was like a mass lashing event so all these things wow it's a lot right and like in in in one way it's good that all of these things went wrong that were in testnet and you said i just a couple of clarifications you said um people were getting upset they were losing lots of money we're talking about losing monopoly money yeah monopoly this is not real money but still it's um disconcerting um one other i guess point of clarification um you said uh you you said raul that like we went down and things went down um it was only the prism validator that had the original bug in the original issue right which was you know again we have a multi you know client test net but prism was about how many in in terms of total percentage of validators it was a pretty large percentage right yeah i would say that it's probably around 60 or 70 percent at the time and in terms of validators in terms of nodes it was around 65 percent of network which is very it's extremely imbalanced right and i mean to your credit i think that's because you guys have made onboarding super easy you know maybe relative to to some other approaches and you guys put your put your name out there but that is why we have multiple clients here right so that if we have a fatal flaw in one we have the others to to fall back on another maybe misconception people have been hearing is that the the medasha testnet died did it actually die like did consensus stop did the chain stop going no totally not the only reason the chain will die are a few scenarios right it's like if every single node invalidator goes down for a very long time and literally nobody is synced to the chain head and you cannot find a single good pier everyone thinks different things and maybe yeah the chain can die if there's like a total takeover of the chain so it takes over a huge amount of the eath and basically turns into a glorified database then you lose all reliance on the blockchain so no the chain didn't die the chain worked exactly as it's supposed to work which is great so that's what we call liveness so liveness is the property that you know even if there's a lot of issues going on the chain should still be able to go on and recover eventually the problem with this is that sorry the problem with this is that you know we need around 66 percent leaders to be online and doing things correctly and after all these issues happen people grew frustrated you know people maybe turn down their notes like we didn't reach that number for a long time so the chain was still in a bad state and we had to rally the troops and get everyone who was running validators to make sure they're online and doing their job and that was a really great experiment yeah so it didn't die but to be clear it wasn't finalizing is that correct it wasn't uh moving forward at all like if it was live it wouldn't die but that it would mean you couldn't you know get transitions done you couldn't deposit into ave or something like that yeah the chain was blocks were still being produced the chain was moving um yeah definitely what it what it means though is that basically not enough validators were voting on the chain head correctly so people were losing money um and were consistently losing money but blocks are still being produced gotcha so let's talk about like these in what if this had happened in like in a live environment because you know test nets or test nets and and live maintenance or live maintenance and these are different things right and so you know in in this test net world there's less incentive for people to like fix the problem right because it's a test net there's less at stake and so like in if this were a real uh scenario where with actually phase zero was up and running like i think we would have seen some different dynamics right because p you could have seen people like moving from one client to another you could have seen people like maybe react sooner so how did the fact that this was a test net play into how people responded to this incident yeah i think speaking of that there's a few key action items that came out of this that i think are really important and critical for the client team so like you said the main thing is being able to switch software implementations if there's a problem that that is not easy at the moment and it's not well documented whereas in mainnet that'll be one of the main things that is uh marketed and and documented to people so and by that you mean in an emergency situation if i had to move from prison to lighthouse i i should have a very easy way to migrate and move quickly right that's right that's right it should be super easy it should be easy to find how to do so um and that doesn't require downloading a whole entire new chain right you can use your old chain data to port over into a new client is that correct yeah good question so i think that might be a little bit hard to do for us right now because uh the the different client teams chain data in different ways but at the very least you know it shouldn't take too long to sync um what's more important is that you can do it safely so that you can switch your validators and you know you won't get slashed or do anything nothing crazy will happen so that's one action item that came out of this um the other action item that came out is basically you know having better responses and better external communications that's something we can learn a lot from the e1 core developers so a big mistake that we made was tell everyone hey your node when everyone is in the crisis mode and what happens is nobody can sink to the chain head because everyone is thinking with each other so that's another thing to do overall really a ton of things that happened moreover we discovered a lot more issues and a lot of client teams discovered other issues and how they how they assume like their assumptions that their code makes in times of the chain being crazy so for example when there's a lot of forks going on uh like cpu and ram goes up like crazy right you're using like eight gigabytes some teams were using like 12 gigabytes of ram and that's not reasonable you know it's like because a lot of the software was written with the assumption that everything is great but when the chain is in a really crazy state um you know we need you need to fix those things and overall we pushed out more improvements that week than i think we've done in the last six months uh which is excellent every team has done so as well and i think they're a lot more robust um from that situation um yeah it's it's been it was a really great learning experience so i think one question that everyone has myself included is how does this impact the rollout of phase zero and there seems to be some ambiguity here because like the chain didn't chain didn't die chain's still up and running but there was a also like a quote unquote critical bug so has there been any sort of consensus among the client teams as to how this actually impacts the launch of phase zero sure so there hasn't been like a particular discussion about the timeline we we particularly recommend that the timeline should still be on track uh the chain is actually better than before it is it is it is now we have like 78 patients so it's stronger than ever and we managed to recover from this and do it in a really uh in a really great way and fix a lot of problems we recommend the timeline still remains the same i believe there's basically like the thicker since the launch of the test net for three months so that's like you know three months in which we should we should release yeah there are likely discussions about like you know we we should do a lot more like genesis tests or do a lot more maybe private testings on the side staging environments and such um but overall no official statement what's currently being worked on is having a timeline for a checklist for you to launch so basically we have a list of big things that need to be done by everyone before we can say okay let's launch and that will help the community a lot to figure out how that's going to happen instead of speculating on dates right so if you see that you know we're filling out maybe two check boxes every week and there's like there's like 20 check boxes and that can give you a good idea of what's going on so that's that's going to happen and that's being worked on i think people will receive it well [Music] i tend to think that the probably the the thought in most people's mind is there's there's a hope maybe that we finish this in uh q4 right that's kind of the hope um and we get phase zero launched in q4 but there's the expectation that it could bleed into into next year as well into the first quarter at least next year but i don't think many people are thinking that you know this this would ship as as late as q2 is that about right in your mind like without giving specific dates does that feel right absolutely absolutely we're in a very different place than we were like a long time ago when a lot where shipping discussions were happening like yeah they're like pretty much no they're pretty much no outstanding features like from anyone at this point a lot of things that are just like make sure that standards are met make sure that we can switch between clients like improving improvements and such user experience so yeah definitely i think that unless something goes perfectly wrong and like the test that dies and every test afterward dies until q2 that that would suck but no honestly like you know there are a lot of last minute things that need to be need to need to be finished for the users and the stakers to be safe so that's kind of where we are right now all right well raul it's been a pleasure i um you know one question from me david might have another but one question for me is how can tankless nation help we are incented to get the madosha test net fully vetted and fully tested so that we can have phase zero and start um you know moving to proof of stake how can how can the nation help here yeah totally um we'd love for you guys to to just join the test net i mean it's it's it's open it's it's public anyone can try it out and basically by a node or validator you're contributing to helping us ship this thing faster and safer so you know if you run into any crazy issues or unexpected bugs you can tell us and and you know you might you might have found something very important uh before we go live with real money so um you can use you can use you can go to our docs portal so you can go to docs.prylabs.network you can go to the e2 launchpad maybe you guys can link that in in the in the chat or um you know for for your listeners you know you so you know what we're doing raul so no one's seen this yet but we're actually um pushing out a bankless guide for getting on the madosa test net that we think could be super comprehensive and that's actually happening to so i've got a document in front of me that is a guide to get started on the medasha test net written by some folks that you probably know raul at consensus who developed the uh launch pad so it walks you through it i think in a pretty easy to way uh easy to understand manner at least like i would say this is probably intermediate to advanced technical proficiency it's not going to be like as easy as getting a meta mask while it working but it's still doable for someone like myself for instance and it takes you through getting hardware set up to let's see choosing a client like you were saying uh prism is one there are some others um and uh installing the eth1 node which i guess is a requirement um to getting some gourley is gourley the actual what is that is that the monopoly money yeah that's like the eth1 tesla that's supposed to be similar to the eth1 main net okay and then and then heading to the launch pad and actually getting started so hopefully this will be another one of the ways you can quickly get going on the midasha testnet um raul is there anything else you'd leave us with um yeah yeah definitely um yeah i sent you guys a link to our docs portal so we recommend people to to run on that and your listeners can check that out and maybe you can cross-check your instructions with that um so yeah that'll be good very good well thanks so much for joining us and best of luck to you and your team you guys have been putting i'm sure last week was probably a week without much sleep but um yeah thanks so much for putting all the time in we're yeah we're definitely supportive of everything that's going on and very excited cool thank you guys so much really appreciate it awesome take care cheers great take care guys yeah david i think i mean it it all sounds really promising at what point in time are you gonna spin up something unless you have i don't know if you have but um at what point in time are you going to spin up a node on the madosha test net yeah uh i'm going i'm thinking about getting an actual like desktop computer and when that happens that's when i i will start running running nodes and i think like right you know running a node has never really interested me because it seems like a big pain in the butt and i always had like a laptop but also running uh for some reason running multiple clients sounds uh interesting to me for some reason running two rather than running zero and i think that's coming out of like an incentive to make sure to be like a gatekeeper of the network right to be to be a guard of the network because you know if you're running you're running what run node you're doing a job but if you're running if everyone is running two nodes then ethereum will literally never ever die because you have such strong redundancy and so i'm interested in that yeah it's so for me it's not something necessarily that i would natively like geek out with like i geek out other things you know but um you know it's not something natively that i would be super excited about but i do feel like it's almost there's there's somewhat of like it's it's a patriotic duty there's some patriotism yep absolutely right it's just like like oh you know uh if you are if you're a citizen of the ethereum nation like you run a node right yeah like it's kind of like the the bitcoiner challenge like pierre richard's challenge of like shut up and like show me the node you run and like run the numbers and get it right um yeah it's not going to be for everyone but i think that this is an opportunity to um to start from scratch right and do that so at some point i will certainly um start running a node as well in the testnet yeah and i actually came into ethereum uh via mining right and so that's right i i had like mining computers like scattered around my house and it felt very cool to because it was a literal manifestation of the ethereum blockchain like in my house like putting out yeah right and like that felt cool like i felt like like i am part of this thing like i there's this there's this like surreal metaphysical like network nation community like blockchain existing just in the ether somewhere in the in the internet and like a piece of it is in my house and that felt right that felt cool and what you're doing which is super cool like it's not so much true on the test net but what you're doing with running your mining gears you're actually like minting money for this new nation right right like how crazy is that like yeah so i i will also certainly get um much more excited when this is live eve at stake and like seeing a validator seeing the node that you're running actually uh minting some of the the eth that you've deposited um i anticipate that's going to be like a crazy cool feeling so i'm very excited so bankless nation maybe it's within your patriotic duty to help with the midasha testnet run your node get in early figure out how to do it we'll publish the bankless guide we'll also publish raul's link to the prism docs you can just see how complex or easy it is uh see if it's for you david we should talk about our second round of sponsors as well do you want to start with amp ample fourth king of the rebasing mechanism uh we've heard a lot about rebasing uh from a bunch of different tokens that are now integrating it and ample forth was the original rebasing token right and so ample forth is a rebasing monetary experiment so it's very similar to bitcoin in the sense that it's non-dilutive but instead when there's when there's demand for bitcoin the price goes up because there's there's an extreme inflexibility of supply ample forth is the opposite where there is extreme flexibility in supply but in flexibility in the price right and so if you buy one percent of all ample tokens you are assured to have one percent of all ample forth tokens in the future but what you don't know is how many tokens that will be because the token supply goes up and down and so every 24 hours there is a rebasing mechanism that will add or remove amples from your wallet in order to track 2019 right so super interesting mechanism we've seen a lot of new alternative projects also start to experiment with this rebasing mechanism they have a liquidity mining incentive program where you can add ample and ether to the uniswap pool and then stake that token that you get when you do that to the geyser and you'll receive extra amples for adding liquidity to the network so you can check them out at ampleforth.org you know what else they've added david i don't know if you've looked at this but they've actually um added to their geyser muna swap which is new automated market maker from one inch so there's some additional eligible pools that i saw them add recently i also want to tell you about our second sponsor of this set which is uh poly market so poly market is a way to bet on your beliefs it is a prediction market so it's an information markets platform and what poly market is doing is making it really easy to use your crypto assets to bet on things if you've ever used prediction markets um like auger for instance or like omen um gas fees are high it's difficult to use the user interface isn't uh isn't amazing because it's all kind of on chain what poly market does is it makes the user interface really easy but still allows you to use your crypto to bet on events so you can bet on current events like who will win the 2020 u.s presidential election you can also bet on crypto comes as well so we talked about phase zero launching will it launch before the end before the end of 2020 or will it bleed into 2021 well you can make a bet and see if that's true as well um bet on your beliefs with polymarket at poly.market and you'll find out all about that also use the code bankless if you email them at hellopoly.mark with the code bank they will cover all of your early gas fees and give you um their their newest features so early access to their unreleased poly market features so make sure you do that as well david i don't think there could be a better year to launch a prediction market right right 2020 there's so much uncertainty we need we need prediction markets so perhaps it's also your patriotic duty to go and help and make prediction markets uh more accurate because the more people that use these things the more accurate they become at least they become oracles they become articles very cool yeah um all right david let's talk about our second topic today which is layer two so eth gas fees man it's been a running topic on bank list since really we started because gas fees are not really going down they've gone down a little bit recently um but like everyone's asking the question of like when scale when scale have you read the article that nay carter put out um this week he just published it yesterday so i'm not sure if you had a chance to read that yet i have not no that's one of the one of the things i've not yet caught up on okay so um put that in your cube because it's uh it's really good really interesting so we had nick on the podcast a few weeks back i'm not sure what episode that was but um you know we'll try to include it in the show notes um and one of the topics among many that we talked about was the topic of economic density particularly transaction density you remember this david when we talked about this so i feel like nick kind of wrote an article um with some of the id he presented in that bank list podcast that have been kind of germinating and it's basically the idea that even on something like ethereum right because block uh space is scarce what's going to happen inevitably is that those that are willing to pay the highest price for the gas for the block space on ethereum are going to be the highest economically dense transactions so i'm willing to spend twenty dollars on gas if i'm making a thousand dollars right but i'm not willing to spend twenty dollars on gas if i'm making ten dollars right like i would be losing money in that transaction so the idea is that this all because blocked block space is scarce this all consolidates so that even something like ethereum um you know the main chain consolidates to only the most economically dense transactions and those tend by the way to be money types of transactions or in a specula of fervor it's something like farming yams right right and this is this talks about this with haseeb on our last podcast right where he gave us the model of like d5 there might there likely will be the defy shard which will be like the manhattan of crypto which it's expensive to live in manhattan it's costly rent is high food is high uh and and that's because that there's just a lot of reward for living there and it pushes a lot of people out and that's why like not everyone lives in manhattan and so he makes this statement david i want to see if you agree with this or i've got it highlighted so um he says all of this everything we just talked about is sobering for some ethereans because it's punctured some of the more expansive visions of what ethereum could be like the world computer other things at least in its present form with high fees the most economically dense transactions come to occupy block space to the exclusion of all else so do you agree with that statement david what like what's your take yeah i i agree with this because like the ethereum is the values that have kind of been baked into ethereum is trying to be like as equitable and inclusive at as possible right but at the end of the day there are things that get included in the blockchain and things that don't get that things get excluded and unfortunately if you don't have the capital to pay your way into the blockchain you get excluded and so at some point like we can all like love our kitties and rainbows and unicorns but some people aren't going to be able to play and that's just a fact of life right people with more capital tend to be able to play longer than others uh and and so i i think like it's we we're starting to now realize that like you know the the main l1 chain of ethereum might be closer to a whale chain that we than we originally thought which is sad but we also have solutions for this so it's okay well that's what i want to talk about because so i agree with i've probably the central threat thrust of um nick's article that hey ethereans have to come to accept and maybe this is sobering for them that higher economically dense transactions are going to reign supreme on the main chain but he also said this which i probably agree with a little bit less um vitalik peter in one state reference to bitcoin that the internet of money should not cost five cents a transaction it's safe to say his attitude to fees and that of ethereum's more broadly has moderated with time i'm not so sure that that is true because and here's the reason why that might be true of bitcoin i think it kind of is true but um ethereum has a slew of you know apart from each 2.0 scalability a slew of layer two solutions that are coming right now and that are fixing this kind of problem right so it's basically the internet of money more broadly it's not just ethereum main chain it's also something that you can do in a layer 2 like a loop ring for instance or an omg network or something like that so i'm not sure that he yeah so i'm not sure i agree with that statement because i don't think vitalik um the reason the reason ethereum is embarking on this entire scalability thing is because the internet of money shouldn't cost five cents a transaction bitcoin might be more limited right in that it's got lightning and kind of nothing else it scales with crypto banks really right now um but ethereum has never been okay with that and that's why that's why scalability exists yeah i think nick carter's bitcoin or a hat came out when he wrote that sentence because i i think he was he's missing the nuance of the optionality that ethereum has with how to scale that bitcoin does not have like bitcoin has the ability to scale with lightning and that has not worked out at all and that and that's about it that's about as as many options as bitcoin has and and then the other option is to scale with crypto banks uh what what nick may be missing here is the fact that you know ethereum if you if you are a person who has you know thirty dollars on ethereum you're a very low capital uh individual that doesn't have you don't have much capital on ethereum and you are at point a and you're trying to get to point b if that if getting from a to b costs you five cents and it didn't actually end up touching the l1 blockchain like that's cool we're cool with this like you got your goals achieved and like it didn't happen on the l1 but you still got your goals achieved like that's that's where like i think vitalik and nick carter are differing here where nick carter thinks or is baking into that sentence a commitment to use the l1 and things like ck roll-ups or like side chains like omisego or starkware like you don't touch the l1 but you still achieve your goal and importantly you still get all the insurance the assurances of the l1 present like the the l1 is security is still present in these types of transactions absolutely yeah and we made there that lightning network is um is not working right it's not to say technically it doesn't work it's just it hasn't hit product market fit at all yet and um like there's evidence of that i feel like i you know god bless bitcoiners but they've been trying to mean the year of lightning since like 2016 yeah right it's like next year is the year of lightning next year's the so this year was going to be the year of lightning it is number 22 in terms of like if you look compared to some of the d5 protocols another layer twos on ethereum we've got um loop ring that's ahead of it now right which is just one isolated ethereum layer two solution right in terms of usage which you can really like usage capital amount capital deposited that's that's the true usage of an application so it it hasn't hit product market fit it hasn't worked and to be fair a slew of ethereum layer two experiments haven't worked either right um they've been hyped and then dormant raiden comes to mind for instance but the beauty of ethereum is it's like um optionality it's like a science lab we've got you can run hundreds of different experiments concurrently whereas um bitcoin has kind of put all of its eggs in the lightning bask like there's really not much else well no it put all of its eggs in the l1 basket and it locked down l1 expressivity to reduce reduce reduce and then all of a sudden like that reduces any all of your optionality and so like they basically have now two options one's lightning network and the other one is crypto banks um which i mean if that's what you want okay that's fine um yes i think it has been interesting to note like if we were having this conversation with like a bitcoiner they would they would like a year ago they would say like you know no one can actually know the supply of lightning network because it's private and and that was like their denial abilities like you don't know how much like d5 pulse like that works like deep doesn't know how much bitcoin is in the lightning network because the channels are private i don't hear i don't hear those arguments anymore because everyone knows like like that it doesn't matter like no one's still no one's using it and so by proxy we know there's not that much there absolutely yeah so so let's talk about i guess the positive of this because um to be fair ethereum has been saying layer two is coming forever right i remember do you remember the omg hype you're a child of 2017. you remember the omg hype of 2017. i was part of the omg hype yeah were you yeah you had the skateboard yeah i didn't have the skateboard but i definitely had the tokens that's for sure okay all right so you have the tokens right and i'll assume that you bought some too they weren't just uh gift airdrop to you i was not there that actually i came around right after that air drop okay so it's but but layer two is actually starting to happen right it's not like this utopia of everything works in layer two yet but it's starting to happen so loopering like we mentioned um is a an exchange here it is it's fully built on um zk roll ups in layer two so it's secured essentially by the ethereum blockchain you can use it today so this is a fully fledged exchange in fact uh d5 dad just published a fantastic three reasons you should be loopering dex video to bankless youtube yesterday so you know check that out and go through it that's a flavor of you yeah what layer two is basically one transaction to kind of deposit your ass to set up your account it's about 12 in gas right now right but once you get past that you can do trades basically secured by ethereum for like a couple of cents a transaction you can even send things from one loopering wallet to another against ethereum for a couple of cents not five cents the internet of money it's like less than a cent for many of these transactions on loopering so that's one example of it already being here there are some others too we should talk about david yeah actually before before we talk about the others i do want to talk about like why this is so cool in a way that i don't hear many people talking about right and so one of the bearish things about all these different l2 solutions is that they break composability right and so like now if you're on loopering it's harder for you to interact with something that's on starkware or even the main chain for that matter and maybe you like want to trade on loop ring um but your value is on the main chain and like you're you when you buy on your ether on coinbase you have to go through the main chain to get to loop ring now l2 is like loopering or like dydx we're about to talk about in their l2 with starkware they all have incentives to build on-ramps right into their l2 right and so instead of everyone going and getting an on-ramp right onto the main chain you can on-ramp right into the l2 and again you don't actually ever touch the l1 you but you still get the settlement assurances of the l1 and now instead of just like all these capital on-ramps going into the main chain we have all these additional capital on-ramps going into their respective l2s which can then also go right into the l1 if necessary but i think we're about to see not only an explosion of l2s but an explosion of on-ramps directly onto these l2s because each individual because of the lack of composability there's more incentive for all of these l2s to actually build out their own on-ramps now that's super cool i didn't quite put that a fiat on-ramp together with that but that is a missing part of the puzzle so to to i guess maybe connect some dots to what david is talking about so this is dydx they are a um an exchange uh specializing in um you know uh you know synthetics and options and that sort of thing just sort of the bitmex of d5 if you will deployed on the main net now what they're going to be moving to is their entire kind of trading engine including perpetuals and options are going to be moving to a stark x layer two by the end of this year so again like we're just talking a few months away and what you're saying david is so dydx they started on main chain now they are migrating to a layer two that's secured by main chain and all they essentially have to do to become as powerful as a bitmex or like a coin base or something like that is connect in fiat on ramp and essentially somehow somewhere whether that's through wire or i mean wire would be a great choice like every now every l2 has their own incentive to make it easier for you to just go straight into the l2 and then people can be fi find out that they're using ethereum without even knowing what ethereum is like that's where that line comes from right and so they can own their own assets essentially that they don't have to give up custody to a bitmex they own their own assets and they can see the trading activity on a public chain so it's not like a black box right so it's a much more bank alternative and i also read this dc investor put this out which is super cool is the idea of so diversify they've been a sponsor as well but diversify is another exchange that has built on layer two um dydx are both running on separate they're gonna be running on separate rollups but they're going to create interoperability between them so another incentive in addition to adding fiat gateways directly to these layer twos is actually to start having the layer two talk to one another themselves where it makes sense right absolutely and and i'm just so excited to get on to antonio into the bankless ama on thursday because i have so many questions uh like of this nature to talk to him about that's going to be really really enlightening as to some of the details going on here yeah you know another thing that came out so i i do feel like um you know maybe it's not the year of lightning maybe it's the year of ethereum layer two so right it's all starting right this stuff you know that that uh we're talking about omg didn't ship anything in 2017. to be honest i thought it was like i thought it was dead i thought it was dead so i thought it was dead and it just came out this week with um a a really fascinating kind of use case that's live in production um this is their their pr about i think the tweet sums it up a little bit better but basically omg is a layer two it's built on plasma so not optimistic roll-ups you don't know what that means don't worry about it but it is still secured by the ethereum network in the same way that that loop ring was um now bitfinex so they are the originators of the popular the most popular staplecoin by far um usdt tether staplecoin they are now connecting directly not to not to directly to omg networks layer two right where they can get you know transactions and settlement for like fractions of a penny whereas on ethereum right now wow i should pull up the gas station here it's bad all right yeah they're this is what they've always been up there the fact that actually uniswap has trumped them is relatively new but tether has always been guzzling the most gas on ethereum for for years for years now and yeah like a large and that's just now starting to be like d5 transactions which means that like they're some of some of that tether is going to have to remain on l1 but a lot of this is just simple erc20 token transfers which are costing traders between 5 and 20 depending on gas fees to send you know their tether just to exchange arbitrage just exchange arbitrage and no only reason why that needs to be on the l1 it's costing that it's costing uh bitfenix the company that basically and like this is a 30-day period of time so tether bitfenix tether traders anyone who does settlement with tether on ethereum they're paying close to six million a month for that right so i mean yo what is that almost 70 million annualized per year right that's a pretty steep line item right right yeah and it's only gonna go higher as d5 expands and expands right so what i love about this is it's an example of um like the market doesn't always fix things but sometimes the market does fix things if you're spending six million a month on tether gas fees it doesn't make sense to spend that when you've got something like the omg network and it's the market working to remove lower economic density transactions nick carter's right from the ethereum main chain to the layer twos and it's starting to happen and as that activity happens the layer two has become more incentive to actually build not to build just to pump a coin like omg coin but to build because there's real value and real um cash flows associated with becoming like the king of the layer twos right right and this is the perhaps the end of this conversation goes back to like the bankless vision right because this is how we retain banklessness right like if we can't scale on layer twos then you therefore scale on centralized exchanges and if so every time we see a layer tilt a layer two crop up to solve an l1 problem that retains the truss minimization and settlement assurances of the ethereum l1 that is the bankless nation like spreading into new fields right like that is the bankless thesis like growing and so anytime we have this like l2 growth and adoption story i what i hear is a removal of the need of centralized intermediaries that's what i see yeah absolutely and you know the other thing i see is it's sort of an interesting i guess you were talking uh to haseeb you asked him a really pointed question on the podcast earlier this week um you asked him hey if we have layer twos why do we need um eat killer chains right right other other mainnets essentially and he had an answer for it um i'm not necessarily persuaded by it because what i see is something like omg could be hugely bullish for the eath killers uh bearish excuse me and and bullish for ethereum because what it means is the eath killers aren't really competing with ethereum main net they're competing with all of these layer twos that are evolving super fast number one they're already integrated natively with ethereum and they already have security figured out like they don't even pay for it ethereum pays for it essentially right so it's like outsourced security that's pretty hard to compete with what we're seeing is even change as he mentioned like uh near what what's near doing it's building a bridge like last week it's building a bridge to ethereum because it has to because it has to compete with the other layer two is to get some of that economic activity on on its own chain or it fails so we'll see how that evolves but um i think it's pretty it's probably pretty bullish ethereum so like i think there's going to be a very strong blurring of the lines between what is an ethereum l2 and what is uh a east killer that that then builds a bridge because they're they're starting to become like closer and closer the same thing and i can i can like rattle off like five or six different eat killers right and i think there's going to be this game theory between them is like who's going to defect first and start to rebrand and reorganize themselves as like an ethereum bridge side chain like l2 like right like if near near build a bridge to ethereum well then it's like basically ethereum's l2 right in a sense and like perhaps you in in if you use the the near perspective you could call near the l1 and ethereum the l2 on like just by reorienting how you perceive things because like if you want to take the near perspective well then near is the l1 and ethereum's the l2 but right and we really here like which one's bigger like which one's the real l1 here but what but you're right there the game theory is what near is trying to do right um is they're trying to pull all of that economic activity from ethereum back to near and essentially um i guess leave sort of uh ethereum a skeleton chain essential and become the main chain right so like the side chain wants to betray its master and like do a sith lord thing where it's just like it becomes the pasture ultimately like the value of near i don't think will ever be able to be larger than like exactly how much value it produces for users and again like then you have we have to compare near to all the other l2s out there and so like it's really just like it's ethereum's game dude and it's all we have it always has been like we've always done this yeah well yeah maybe i mean i've just i come away from that getting more bullish about ethereum but um you know who knows i you know could be wrong on that we'll see but let's talk about another thesis of the bankless nation this is our third topic and then we'll turn it over quickly for if anyone has any questions um who's watching this live and that is david the protocol sync thesis it feels like every week we see more evidence that the critical sync thesis is directionally correct and i feel like last week like i couldn't even keep up with right we used to almost catalog like a back and forth of twitter you'd be like hey is this protocol sync thesis ryan um like last week i couldn't even keep up with it because there's so many things that were happening maybe do you want to talk about the protocol sync thesis just a quick recap and like talk about what's going on yeah quick recap the protocol sync thesis when we when i say a sync i want you to think of like a basin right where things tend to fall down to the bottom and in this basin are different protocols and there are according to the protocol sync thesis there are different characteristics or qualities that make things fall down to the bottom of the protocol sync and those characteristics are the things that we are in crypto to begin with right like trust minimization censorship resistance you know decentralization um you know sovereignty would be one and so these protocols that have more of these characteristics fall down to the bottom of the protocol sink and that's because they act as really good infrastructure things that are dense that are dense because of their trust minimization because of their credible neutrality because of their decentralization they become dense and they become very stable foundations to build on top of like bitcoin is a great example of something that's really really dense in the protocol sync because you have assurances that bitcoin is never going to change you have assurances that it's always going to keep on producing blocks and therefore as a perhaps an entrepreneur you feel stable in building your business on top of bitcoin and ethereum is the same thing and not only is ethereum the same thing but there are ethereum protocols that are the same thing like everyone is basically built on top of unit swap at this point right like uniswap is one of the perhaps the densest protocol on top of ethereum and now everyone's building on top of it right and we can also layer in like make or dow compound ave they have different like respective amounts of density in the protocol sync thesis and then as people build on top of them they become more dense they literally become heavier and they fall down lower into the protocol sink and so the concept of the protocol sync thesis the main predictive quality of this thesis is that centralized companies will never ever be able to have as much density as a protocol on ethereum and they will ultimately come to build their own products on top of protocols that are dense in the same way that like we are all like google apple facebook like whatever like they are all are all building on top of the internet the internet is also really dense the internet is at the bottom of the protocol sync and so like companies can build on top of this like stable dependable infrastructure because of how like no one owns it no one's rent seeking it's like it's going to exist in the into the future and so therefore becomes infrastructure for everybody else it's the most credibly neutral it says the most credibly neutral protocols will win basically right mm-hmm it's cool because it's kind of the thesis for why crypto can be successful like bitcoin and ethereum the yd5 criticals are successful and what i love about critical sync is as you said david it does have these predictive qualities basically like you can use the framework to round about make predictions so this is a um a podcast that we put out in may 18th and it was based on a post that i wrote in february and based on some talks that you gave at ethereal in like april right which just talked about the protocol sync and it made this prediction it made the prediction that crypto exchanges will start adding d5 criticals to them again because d5 protocols have more density so they sink to the bottom of the critical sink right they're more credibly neutral and what we're seeing is every single week this happens more and more and more so what we saw uh this week for instance is this was big binance right so like the the actual i think we made in the podcast david was this a major exchange like a coin base or a binance would incorporate the die savings rate by the end of 2020. that's what binance just did here so um what what they're doing is they're launching defy staking with dyes so you can deposit your die you have to give custody to them of course because it's binance it's a crypto bank and what they're doing if you read the if you read the fine print um let's see here what they're doing is they're actually depositing that die or they have the ability to deposit that die into compound staking okay compound staking is backed by the die savings rate right so again dye and maker is more has more density so it sinks to the bottom and then compound is built on top and then exchanges are built on top of both of those and all of it's built on top of ethereum right the the most dense protocol of them all essentially right so that's what they're doing here um which is essentially our prediction right and and what's really important here is like uh it's actually pretty cool that they just explicitly say where where that die is going which is which is important but also like they could have just said you know you get 12 and like you just give it to us and then you get 12 percent and in the background they could submit it to compound in the background they don't have to tell anyone you don't have to tell anyone and i i hope that they take a cut because they're a business they are they totally are they totally are and like that's why they're able to give twelve percent right right savings rate is only like it's zero right now or something close to that right well so i don't think the die savings rate's actually integrated here i think it's only compound like the dice compound is compound is built and incorporates the diets right though does it yes okay interesting yep okay anyways so binance takes a cut as a profit seeking like venture which is why they're doing this and this is good for the users because then you get centralized exchange ui ux if that's what you're into and then you also get a shirt like some amount of insurance right because like if compound blows up like buying binance is on the hook right and like binance has paid debts before for things that they've lost and so like you it maybe you enjoy like 12 in compound but you don't like that that contract risk which is real and so then you can go to binance and give them a percentage cut of what the interest rate is because you know that if compound blows up binance will pay back the diet that it owes you i'm exactly like this like take it what's cool so so some people um some people were upset at finance doing this they basically said look it's another crypto bank like taking a um basically centralizing a you know something like like die the die savings rate right i don't think that's true and the reason is because of the protocol sync essentially die and compound are below finance anyone can tap into it right finance is trying as hard as it can to add its value add that additional like whatever 10 or so that it can give by doing other things within finance but comp but coinbase can add the same to its platform and essentially what finance becomes is kind of like a an onboarding layer to the world to d5 right it is the thing that becomes commodities not defy it is putting more total locked value into compound and into maker and into ethereum essentially not the other way around so that layer becomes the commodity and essentially the the fat dephy critical thesis or protocol sync as we kind of call it like that becomes the thing that accrues value at least that's the idea that's the thesis so yeah i love this i don't hate it i love it because they're building on top of it and they're not able to use serpent and everyone has access to it any bank in the world has access to these protocols and so do you as a self-sovereign individual on the bankless journey this is pretty exciting that was the only thing david so like um kobe is a major knocking them down exchange knocking them down right what are they doing they this week are launching a defy alliance to merge the east and west who's part of this alliance compound maker dydx that looks like a finger you're playing cat's cradle it's a metaphor i guess for a dip for the east and west like in playing with you or whatever is that it okay so i can get that i skip that all right so that's what they're doing i don't i don't understand the image but they're also incorporating ave directly into the huawei wallet so again ave is kind of a d5 protocol more credibly neutral than these others and they're just incorporating it so right now and this is just the beginning man look we're starting with like the crypto native companies right we're starting with binance coinbase who will be like but you know paypal is going to integrate bitcoin and ethereum like in the next like 12 months probably like we know we know this is coming and right then they're going to come do it and then and then it's just your actual crypto banks are actually going to be doing this right like yeah we're starting we're starting with a low hanging fruit but then it's just going to become like you know your wells fargo like deposit your cash into like d5 with wells fargo get seven percent like that's that's coming yeah and pretty much not in this year not next year but like it's coming it's coming right it's i mean uh bitcoin is the original like sort of you know fat protocol that that's sunk to the bottom and now entire banks are built on top of it right gem like all of these banks are built on top of it so it is coming and what's going to happen it seems like is there's going to be a gradual swapping out of the base layer the base settlement layer for fiat based traditional systems with crypto based systems and why is that good why do we care well we're just replacing one with another well this base system is internet native it's programmable it's digital and it belongs to the people the rules can't be changed right but like there's no you know you know like people are so sick of politicians these days david because and and those in power because they act like the rules don't apply to them right like they do something against the law and they'll just get some attorney that gets them off the hit hook or they'll bribe someone or know someone in power right this is epstein this is everything that's going on today the laws always apply to everyone equally in crypto systems right if you're using ethereum if you're using bitcoin the laws apply to you equally no there's no subject subjectivity in cryptography exactly there's no subjectivity there's no you know special person who gets to bend the rules or like skirt around them and that's why it's a more credibly neutral money system for the world that belongs to the people it's still like i mean it's not fair right not everyone gets you know if you have more capital there's advantages to that but it is credibly neutral the rules apply to everyone equally there's no cantillian insiders as um you know nick carter might use the phrase so yep that's why this is important that's why that's important and like yeah and this is how cryptography sneaks in and pulls the rug on like the whole world right yeah like all of a sudden like every everyone answers to cryptography equally and turns out like oh all the value has flowed away from like this this pen and paper accounting system of the nation state into this like uh crypto cryptographically secured like internet protocol that like is one single protocol um and it starts with a protocol sync thesis absolutely very cool man we covered a lot we went through test nets madasha layer two into protocol sync anything else david we should cover yeah you guys in the youtube comments if you have any further last questions any last topics you want to hear from like now is the time i don't i currently see some chatter that's that's pretty cool glad to see some chit chat but i do not yet see any any questions and so there's some in bankless discord david i just flipped to it um one is about obvi's new license did you see this yesterday that's another thing yeah i did see this announcement apparently it's a really big deal but i didn't understand it too much yeah it it seems to me it's basically like you were saying right um earlier about the layer two and the fiat on-ramp so this gives ave a way ave the nc not the protocol of course the protocols not owned by any individuals but the the entity ave company has the ability now to um onboard users directly to ave using their own fiat on-ramp in the uk they have the same sort of licenses that coinbase or other exchanges have in the uk so it's a big step i think for on for for continuing to onboard folks into into d5 and it's interesting that d5 protocols themselves or at least the teams behind them are becoming big enough to actually that they're all incentivized to get more people into into d5 this is like the d5 flywheel effect so it's exciting i mean some people are worried that this could introduce some sort of uh aml kyc right into kind of the mix is is is ave going to like cozy up with um regulators and banks um so that's an outstanding question in general it's an outstanding question to me if which of these d5 protocols become a bit more like banks over time and which preserve maximal credible neutrality like a uniswap for instance but um overall i think it's good for this it's a good step in that direction so absolutely leon on youtube says uh asking about ave moving over to l2 or excuse me to ethereum 2.0 is there an eth one point if there is an eth 1.0 ave loan does that translate over to eth 2.0 seamlessly or does it have to be paid on off on eth one first i'm pretty sure you're going to have to pay it off on eth1 first because the ave protocol on ethereum 2.0 will be different than the ave protocol on on ethereum 2.0 or or vice versa i do think that's the case right if you want to transfer early however at some point in time like after e like 1.5 right there's a couple phases to this um on the roadmap there's the plan to just forklift everything eth1 and just move it over to e2 i think as far as i understand as an execution environment but not account balances account balances have to move over like manually like through the bridge right um i don't think we're going to be able to carbon copy account balances we can carbon copy like the execution environment which means like people can use the ave protocol with the assets that they have migrated over that's that's how i understand it that would be a good follow-up the good news here is i guess well you're not the good news but um don't worry about that now yeah don't even worry about it so much like every there are much smarter people who are solving these problems don't worry about it and it's just a long time away you know what i mean it's like when eth2 comes out it's going to come out in phase zero right and there's going to be a long way from using off youth too so just you know stay tuned with things to bank lists and other channels and you'll figure it out before that those are all the questions all right man it's been state of the nation episode 11. david it's been great thanks a lot man all right let's wrap this up thanks everybody for tuning in make sure you subscribe to the youtube channel so that you guys get notifications as to when we go live uh we do this every tuesday morning at 7 00 a.m pacific time 10 a.m eastern time whatever that time is for you if you're in europe and asia so make sure you stay tuned for this and then again it gets dropped as a podcast on the next day on wednesday but if you're watching the video you get to look at the screenshots look at the data look at the graphs look at our faces so it's much more rewarding if you come to come to the youtube yeah much more rewarding absolutely all right so uh wrist and disclaimers guys everything we talk about all the d5 protocols we talk about are risky eth is risky bitcoin risky you could lose what you put into these d5 protocols but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks so much for hanging in there sticking with the bankless youtube channel state of the nation episode
