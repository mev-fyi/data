something truly Magic is happening here and yes we're in this bear Market phase of it all but there is total magic going on and that just gave me another shot in the arm thing you know what what comes out of this is going to be massive welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys this is part two of our conversation with Rao Paul and the tables have turned this time Raul is interviewing David myself so we wanted to publish this on the bank list podcast as well I hope there are some good takes in here for you this is really an opportunity to talk a little bit about the founding of bankless our early Theses where we got our start how we met uh we're not usually interviewed and I don't think neither David or myself are in a place to kind of ask each other questions as well as a third party would ask us so that's what you're in for today David do you have any Reflections on this episode yeah yeah like you said like we don't I always enjoy being on the other side of the microphone the times that you and I both have been on the other side of the micro microphone are very few and far between and nothing of this caliber of like Rao Paul all I I'm pretty sure the bankless nation will thoroughly enjoy us being interviewed rather than doing the interviewer in the interviewing uh so yeah like Ryan said like the early days of bankless or each and Genesis of Bank list like maybe you came into bank list during 2021 or later and missed mine and Ryan's trajectory up to the Genesis of bankless and then also the early years of Bank list like this will probably provide you a lot of context and probably illustrate how we got to be the way that we are and why we say the things that we say uh so I think this episode is going to be pretty fun for a lot of people it was also an episode very very rare episode where we were reporting in person like totally sitting beside each other so um there's that dining never would have thought possible I know can you believe it uh so guys that's the episode today with Raul Paul talking to I guess David you and I are guests today yeah we're the guests enjoy this one but first a moment to tell you about the

a bit of fun not only are we infrequently on the other side of the microphone but we are even more infrequently actually together in person so this is unique yeah this is uh just just happenstance and uh David you just you just put on your wells Bank list uh t-shirt I I noticed I see there yeah we've got the uh bankless America as well fantastic so as ever I always like to start with people's journey into the space because everybody comes in different ways there's a different hook that brings you on and then your understanding grows from there so I know David you want to start with you yeah yeah yeah yeah um I got hooked I'm a class of 2017 crypto graduate uh so came in bought the top of 2017 as one does net worth went to zero in 2018 and again in 2019. um but I was immediately compelled uh by just doing beforehand how did you get into this uh my first job out of school was in social work um after that I was going trying to figure out my way into the world of Health Sciences um the the through line between that and crypto was that I was in search of trying to find the way to improve people's lives uh for the biggest in the biggest bang for your buck so like how do you do these smallest things that produce the largest net outcomes in people's just well-being my major was psychology with a focus on positive psychology and the tldr of that is just like hey psychology as a as an academic study is all about improving sick people to be normal but what if you apply psychological principles to to normal people to just make them feel strong longer more self-actualized just better and so in pursuit of that I was like okay that's great but in order to make people feel more psychologically sound you need to also improve their Fitness right like you can't be psychologically sound without like exercise and then once you do those two things you might as well round it all out with nutrition and so these there's just a bunch of low-hanging fruit to make the average individual feel a lot better um so on my search for how to find a private practice role in that I discover ethereum because of 2017 and my mind gets opened up to the world of money and finance as an economic substrate for all humans and so like understanding like how do I how do we improve everyone's lives very simply and very easily well money and finance goes down to the root of all things so like very far from psychology but the the through line of just like how do we improve the most people's lives in the easiest most systemic way possible as soon as I kind of you know had the aha moment of like money and finances at the root of all things and ethereum is a new platform for producing that I was just immediately compelled and there was no going back I think David is one of the the only people I've ever heard who came through to crypto through route of psychology and nutrition actually my wife said a behavioral psychologist really she just thinks my nfts are just ridiculous but does she understand them no and I've tried she's just like this is ridiculous there's no psychological uh thesis behind why humans collect these sorts of digital objects he just doesn't want to accept it and she's like no this is stupid yeah I mean and and uh full credit to David too I think one of the things that I've observed because I I've got to see him since 2017 we probably started working together more in 2019 and and then beyond uh to start bankless but this guy has taught himself everything and he's gotten up to speed you know just so quickly and uh to not like know I don't know how much did you know about Finance like how much did you know about my bosses a lot of my friends in college took business so like went through business school yeah what you were doing right it's like money was root of all evil when you go through kind of sociology psychology it's like yeah I wore a cccp shirt in Middle School oh come on so so but this I don't know if you've observed this Raul but but sometimes the most um tradify deepest uh economists people who have gone to graduate school and pursue their PHD they missed this crypto thing for some reason it's because I think they learn bad habits right and so you almost have to enter crypto as a child a blank slate right and like and like kind of go back to the basics of let's let's build out from um base principles what this money thing actually is and then work from there and that's what I've observed David doing in this space I I've uh I was going to mention when we were speaking to um yesterday but I've now on my screen got the bell curve of the mid twit and I was speaking to Melton about this that we've both realized that it's the single most important thing is never be in the middle that's why most of these guys like you saw Talib yesterday on CNBC right he's squarely being the mid twit and it's the Sim Simplicity of the idea is what can drive much better results I think yeah and here's all of my business school friends that that uh you know I was the one psych friend and much to see a business school people but I was the one that discovered crypto well ahead of the curve and did well for myself well well uh at an accelerated Pace in comparison how do they respond to that teasing David you guys you had to unlearn all of this stuff in order to understand crypto it's about like the unlearning that I never had to do I never had to unlearn anything because I never talked about because you could come in as a total [ __ ] yeah yes right and then moved to Jedi Master over time are you on the left side of the mid twit then David are you on the right side I don't know what I am but I'm definitely not in the middle that's all right as long as you're not in the middle so Ryan what's your story how did you get into all of this um not by way of nutrition not by way of psychology I actually did the uh the business school kind of thing right and uh so somehow I unlearned the lessons of Keynesian economics and everything they kind of teach you in business school but I I would say I kind of came at this through the um you know technophile uh startup entrepreneurship kind of thing I I remember um sold a healthcare tech company in 2014 and um the co-founder of the guy I was working with said something to me in passing he's like have you heard about Bitcoin because I have set up a bunch of Bitcoin mining machines in my in my uh garage and this was 2014 right uh of course that was never profitable uh for him unfortunately but I was like what like what the idea of mining using machines using using computers the idea was so foreign that I uh I had a holiday like a kind of a Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S where I had some time and I just went deep down the crypto Bitcoin at the time Rabbit Hole in 2014 spent the entire weekend you know didn't spend as much time with my family as I probably should have but I was just uh everything Andreas Antonopoulos had written or said on the subject I absorbed that I you know read everything I could on the subject and by Monday at the end of that weekend I was ready literally to kind of quit my job as a crypto person I I opened up five Exchange accounts had no idea what I was doing and these were some shady exchanges at the time let me tell you and I was just you know starting to invest start I wanted to go all in um after that I almost think of that as a sort of a manic type of weekend for me because after that I kind of woke up and you know on Monday and I was like okay back to back to work back to what I am doing and um the idea you know crypto kind of left me until ethereum really entered 2016 and now there's the idea if Bitcoin was money over IP which was so incredibly important money over the Internet digital money as a bear instrument that idea so powerful now the ability to program it this ability of smart contracts to actually build a didn't use this phrase at the time but a bankless money system that totally gripped me and totally captured me and this was in 2016 2017 still had no idea what I was doing in the space and actually I wanted to start a crypto fund so you know your assets appreciate a little bit and you rode Bitcoin up you rode uh ether up uh from similos and you're like I'm an investor now I can do this I am brilliant so uh let me manage other people's money uh and did you ever put blockchain expert on your LinkedIn no I'm not that cringe David all right I'm kind of I kind of cringe But but so um I didn't do that because I went down the path in 2017 and I realized um one there was so much I still needed to learn like I didn't have an underlying thesis of where value would accrue in this space and so I had no business managing someone else's money uh like absolutely none and at least you realize that I one I think a lot of people didn't in 2017 because that was the time of like crypto hedge funds and everyone was was kind of launching one um and you know another reason I think a a story arc of of my life and my narrative has been this pursuit of um of freedom and a kind of autonomy right and I saw in crypto a technology that would deliver that not just to myself but but to society to self-sovereign money this concept of once you own private Keys no one can take that away from you right it's decentralization really kind of captured me almost like uh spiritually as well if if that's a way of kind of capturing it and so I knew if I took other people's money at that time I didn't know what that would be a shackle as well and I was here for freedom I was here for kind of you know everything that that entailed so I didn't do it at the time I'm very thankful and I spent the next few years really trying to understand and develop uh my thesis for this space and it turns out David was doing that at the same time we kind of met and converged in this book what was that 2017 or later 2019. before we get to 2019. yeah I just want to hear the genius to idiot phase of suddenly the space collapses it's the first time wow you've fully gone through it I want to hear your mindset because a lot of people are going through that now right and I've I I was a class of 2012 so I've gone through a few times but um it's never fun but you get kind of get used to it so why don't you tell yourself I'll tell mine okay so um you know you watch the the price of a Bitcoin appreciate to you know above 20K right when you purchase much uh much lower than that obviously and then you watch the price of ether appreciate uh you know to 1420 is that a number you remember David yeah uh just hit that very briefly but like that was it right that that was the top and then you watch it fall over the preceding months right fast and Fast okay so you know down down to 800 okay you can hang with that it's just dip right it'll pass down down just like a massive flood at this time you know ethereum's only kind of a had you marked your net worth in your head the classic don't you know what everyone does don't you I mean and and you're kind of now but I used to and and that's when you think you're sort of a genius and uh you do things like one one mistake I I certainly made on the way up is um discover this really cool you know D5 protocol called maker Dao and opened up a you know a nice CDP of course right and I'm protected because can't go below 100. it's great it can't go below 100 can it uh of course not that would be impossible hit you know 1420 we're in a new paradigm and then what happened over the the months and and and even years to come is this massive amount of fud uh this kind of dark period where well maybe it was all a bubble just icos and they have uh Ethan in their Treasures or they just ride the whole thing I rode the entire thing and you know what though it was not easy it's not easy to do that and and particularly um I spent all of my waking hours trying to figure out if I was crazy or not and I don't know if people can identify uh that right now that they're kind of first cyclers if they're just sort of wondering am I the crazy one because that's what the world tells you and not only that Raul in in in a crypto in 2018 that's what the bitcoiners would say Bitcoin Maximus would say it was crypto too it yes it's not only like the outside world is saying crypto is dead but inside of crypto ethereum is dead ethereum is dead there's no like D5 wasn't a thing it's just I feel like Ico is flash in the pan and so what I spent um that year doing was trying to figure out if I was crazy or not and um in 20 I didn't sell during this time until I had some kind of conclusion of whether I was crazy and why sell when you're down bad you know that much anyway and uh so 2019. this is why you shouldn't be a hedgehog exactly so 2019 I I realized that you know what I I don't think I'm crazy I think everybody else is wrong all right like I've spent enough time looking at this technology like doing the pattern uh matching thing and everyone is missing defy everyone is missing what's going on in ethereum this is actually bigger in Impact than just simple money over IP this is an opportunity for a bankless money system and I started to find others that thought the same way David was one of those but I want to hear David yeah what's what's great yeah what's your 2017 zero to zero we need to hear it thankfully I didn't have too much Capital going into 2017 so like my high water mark even though like relatively was super high for me like going back down to zero after that it was like well okay here I was I'm familiar with this like so let me tell you social work does not pay pay quite a lot and especially if you're a student you're already faced with debt uh and so like for me going into crypto is like hey either I go to four plus years of grad school in debt or I go into crypto and no debt and so like that that threshold was already already nice um so yeah so did the whole thing just like Ryan said went up to 1420 thought I was a genius it was a bull market uh tokens were doing crazy things got my got my first like taste of what capital markets and crazy Capital markets can do uh then that's Psychology 101 right yes 100 like definitely learning about herd mentality and all that kind of stuff um uh and then so like yeah 20 2018 came I got it my first job in the space being like a Blog writer Community manager for an Ico advisory company which retroactively retrospectively I'm like okay that's a [ __ ] coin peddling company but you don't really think about that at the time uh Ben got a job at a security token company because all the icos rotated into security tokens and then I got a job at a tokenized real estate startup uh and so I was going from it's just like I was just like Holding On by my fingernails like job to job to job getting through the bear market and meanwhile I learned that I can speak pretty well and so I started my first podcast POV crypto with a bitcoiner co-host and so I was the etherean had a Bitcoin or co-host and we were kind of like this bear Market darling podcast I think that's probably where Ryan I love it yeah I enjoy I listen to this every time you guys publish an episode I would listen to this yeah and I'd be cheering you on David obviously yeah it's like it was funny because like all the bitcoiners that listened to it for because of my co-hosts were like man I really like POV crypto but you're your host is David man I really like POV crypto but your Bitcoin or co-host is an idiot yeah and so we were like yeah like this is my college friend we like each other it's great uh so that's where I learned that's when we learned to like be open and share ideas and so even though we were like fiercely debating with each other we we were friends and so it was with love and it was also like honest and integral and like trying to get down to the to the basement of things so that was my foundation and so like while like trying to hold my grip on to actually having a drive throughout the bear Market I was also doing the whole side gig because like my first job the company blew up and I was laid off and so I was like okay I never it would go like with Ryan's freedom things like I never want to have that be outside of my control ever again I want to work for myself no one's ever going to lay me off ever again and so I started to make a podcast just like that that's mine and and like learn how to make a podcast into a business uh and so that was like my bear market like Endeavor uh can I ask you a question David so um a lot of people left during that time I stayed just to figure out if I was crazy or not why did you stay I my conviction about crypto just did not waver in this light it's like it wasn't even a question to me it's just like I didn't get why people didn't get it and I was the annoying one of my friends was like guys like this is this is real and they were like uh we're going to the baseball game like whatever what do you think you saw that they did like what was it I don't know uh I always I grew up with a computer in my room so I was always like tinkering with computer stuff and internet things and so I understood that like that was more familiar to me I also got in Via mining myself so I was mining ethereum yeah and my father's Bay uh bathroom uh how many rigs did you have I had four rigs electricity water yeah I was well aware um sticking with the [ __ ] thing it worked out and like the the rigs actually still Gathering dust and I turned them off for years ago but I still have them um why why did I have such conviction yeah I there's just some things like from first principles things of like scarcity on the internet like what why wouldn't you have conviction about that like Bitcoin never broke ethereum never broke the things maybe people lost faith in them but the systems worked yeah and I was like icos are still great right yeah they're still a thing I like I don't know it's like people say like why why did you have conviction throughout the 2018 to 2020 bear market like I don't know why didn't you have conviction like what yeah why did you leave yeah price is not people have to learn and you guys obviously learned it was that price is not an indicator right of the overall value of the network over time right it's just where it is that day you know and that's psychology and that's network activity and other stuff but overall you know you just look at I've always just looked at the lows and realized they're always higher yes I think that's the value of the network therefore the network is more valuable each time you go through a cycle I mean that's all you need to know really for me I think there's a definitely a very strong personal element uh as to like why I stuck around um I was right I was learning to write and in my opinion I was learning to write very well as like Not only was I writing what I thought was like pretty on point Theses but I was also going back and editing the piece so that I knew people would effing read it right and so I would write a 3000 word long piece and I would trim it down to two thousand words and then I would trim it down to 1 500 Words and then I would read this like man this is really good piece of article so it was for me it was like a part of like creativity and expression yeah and that kept me going because I was I was tuning my own brain at the same time so like not only is like we can talk about all the fundamentals of crypto and why it's here to stay and like why I had conviction but also I learned personally to like self-actualize and improve myself and become a better person because of what I had to do to get through the bear Market without losing my sandwich yeah what Ryan was doing with trying to figure out is he insane or not right it's the same thing it's that and that's it's at that moment that you really make the breakthroughs it's that it's in the dark days and you're like you know what I've done my thousand hours and I'm building on that right and I'm more sure than ever it's that moment it's a really magic moment uh in this whole crypto space and once you get that you know you're never going to leave it is and you know what gave me the most confidence and I think the reason um I concluded that a big part of the reason I concluded I wasn't crazy during that time was I was spending the Thousand hours actually using these protocols and using these tools and I was looking around me at all of the the critics uh and all of the the naysayers all of the people saying crypto was dead and realizing that they weren't they had never opened a collateralized deposition in maker Dao and seen in a few clicks what you can do without any trusted intermediary I was I was refinancing my house at the time and the amount of documentation I had to sign to get a collateralized loan and I was able to do this on chain in maker using eth as my collateral and in a few clicks as clunky key is that interface was make it happen get a collateralized loan that to me was magic 2019 uniswap coming aboard the ability to swap assets without a centralized intermediary that was all new and so it was putting in the work to actually use these protocols and it just it showed me how hollow the critic's arguments were because they weren't actually doing this stuff they weren't spending the time using the the protocols even even kind of the the notable VCS this is why what I don't know what you believe about like the efficient market hypothesis and this idea that everything is always priced at in I'm like that's complete dog [ __ ] like that that is not my experience of the world like I think the rewards go to the people who stick around and and research and put in the hours and put in the work and so like one message I would say is um you're never gonna make it through this bear Market if you're lazy right like you have to put in the work to actually um use the tools and develop your thinking based on first principles not relying on a YouTuber tick tocker or someone on Twitter to tell you what to think and that is the The Meta skill I think all good investors uh eventually learn it's something that I certainly learned during the last bear Market tell me the story of bankless because you know you guys have you really do produce some of the best quality content out there it's very thoughtful um what was the tell me the story how the hell did you two get together well I saw in 2019 I saw this um this guy writing all sorts of fantastic articles that I started reading um one of them a notable piece was on maker Dao and sort of explaining how that works to the Layman and I I think David you and I started a DM conversation at the time and I was I had started a newsletter called bankless in 2019 and the idea of this newsletter was was very simple it's um to expose more people to defy tools and to help the world go bankless we can all go on the bankless journey and it starts by getting more of your net worth out of banked money systems Fiat in your bank account your Wells Fargo account and more into crypto systems and to the point where you stop using Banks right um and I can say over time I have a much larger percent of my net worth that's bankless over time that that has happened to me and more of my transactions are on chain that are in kind of the bank money system and so it's it's a journey any anyway I wanted to build a community and provide an information resource for people who are going on the journey on the bankless journey and so met David and I was like I have to work with this guy he's a fantastic writer I want this person to write for bankless because it was very hard at the time to publish you know three to five articles per week just myself solo and keep up with the space as well and so I needed some help with that and that's uh where we started he was just kind of a contract writer on bankless and then over time it evolved and he's like hey Ryan we should start a podcast hey hey right hey we should we should start a pot we should start a podcast you kept saying this over and over I was like David we're not going to have enough to actually talk about okay like maybe five episodes worth it's not going to be if you've got faces for radio yeah exactly that's what I told him especially me and and uh so but but he he I don't know I don't know how you did it man but like um it took me a while to convince Ryan that podcast a podcast was a good idea yeah I had been a podcast consumer but didn't think that um I at least had the skills to to produce and then we just hit record one day somehow you convinced me we hit record and that was episode one I think in um May sorry March 2020 um right was it before or right after covet hit episode number two was the day of the covet dump there you go and so that's where we started and then um we just kind of grew it from there and of course uh this is uh this over the last couple days is only the second time Dave and I have met in person this is true um no way yeah so we had we developed this entire thing through covid uh and um met for the first time last year actually it was over two years of working together before we met yeah I mean we had like a 10 plus person company at the time before we ever met yeah uh yeah I mean is that how you remembered David what's your yeah what's your story that's right uh I had my own medium and so I would that's where I was writing all my articles and Publishing all my articles and then I had that that other podcast uh that was called POV crypto point of view crypto and so I had never really meaningfully considered about like branding and business like yes POV crypto was a sex joke even though it was about like two years yeah I'm just learning this what the hell it was like it's like point of view crypto point of view yeah and also Bitcoin but also haha sex uh like I never never really like put on the like hey let's be professional and turn this into a business and scale us out and like lean into a brand I was like writing on my medium just because I wanted people to read my stuff and I I because I didn't go to business school I did not have that part of me to actually be able to build a foundation that was like in that mindset right like a self-sustaining hey we can scale this out we can do this better and more intentionally uh and so I'm just like writing on my medium producing my content uh and then Ryan makes a bankless newsletter and he's like and I kind of like get it it's like oh distribution and my consistency brand oh oh and I'm like okay what if I just take all of my writing and deposit it into the bankless newsletter right and and then it's like Ryan and I are saying the same words anyways and so it's not and there's no like misalignment there and not only that but like the more I talk to him the more precise both of our words become uh and so like we're just sharpening each other's sticks uh and so it goes from a little bit of just like hey can can we work together and be like oh where this is working out can we do a podcast together oh this is working out uh and so it was just like bankless for me has just been this like Bastion of uh creative expression that I think always just like gets me going yeah and like gives me like what a reason to like hey what's the next bit of content I can produce like what's the next thesis I can spit out what's your what's your guys Vision now for bankless yeah that's a good question I mean I think what you've been talking about you guys because now you've had some time together but you know where do you want to go with it I think I think bankless started and uh in a way that you know Dave is talking with with is just an exploration a discovery we've always called it kind of going bankless as sort of the journey West right where you you know you you you set sail and you go try to discover undiscovered lands and I think that's why the podcast has been um for both of us Just Energy producing because we're both learning as we go and so we get to meet amazing people and have fantastic conversations yeah absolutely so and then you're developing your thesis in kind of real time based on conversations with some of the smartest people I I do think that crypto yes crypto attracts this the scammers and the grifters and we have some of the worst of that it also attracts some of the most brilliant uh humanitarian uh wonderful people that I've ever met and to have an opportunity uh you know being David and I at least myself on the left side of that bell curve to have the opportunity to talk to some of these crypto Geniuses these kind of researchers you know best in their field is is absolutely incredible and so uh the cool thing about this now using obviously media as a tool is we can open source this entire journey and this entire Pursuit and it's so it's an open sourcing of that of that journey to go bankless and it's inviting a community to come along with us and that's really what the newsletter uh has been for us and and also what the podcast has been for us and so I think in the bankless community there's now about 300 000 uh members who kind of subscribe to the to the newsletter and um you know that that that was growing I remember in uh you know 2019 no one has noticed I remember the first time um I hit 10 000 on the newsletter and I was like this is what could be better I can't believe that's everyone that's like yeah that that's it uh and so I mean what is kind of the end State ambition in here I think the end State ambition is is similar to you know the ambition of crypto which is private keys in everyone's hands um you know every citizen on the planet ideally uh has the ability and is going at some level at some point in the Spectrum on the bankless journey so I think the end state for us is sort of how do we get a billion people into crypto and provide kind of the the open source Journey um the you know the tools the media uh to do that you know podcasts that they can turn to and um you know jump aboard I I think we we still have some limiters though in crypto like in terms of our our scalability um I'm trying to think I I don't know if you would how you would answer this question but lately David I've been thinking about 2023 and kind of reflecting on it and I feel like crypto has gone a bit more passive in terms of um it's a little bit different than the previous spare Market I would say like you know 2019 there were there were crypto natives using all of these tools and uh you know 2023 I feel like we are we're caught in this rut almost where all we can talk about is regulatory all we talk about is is Gary Gensler we talk about price we talk about the investing side there's tons to do in crypto don't get me wrong but it almost feels like some of us have been content to sit a little passively and watch prices and I'm just hungry for more on-chain stuff to happen and I do feel like the community has to build the apps in order to get us to the next level so that we can you know continue the journey and get to 100 million you know 500 million a billion people we really have to earn that and we're in this place where we haven't quite earned it in 2023. metamask has something new introducing metamask

the killer app to a broader understanding of web3 yeah which is the applications layer of a lot of this how what was your web 3 Journey why did you suddenly start to see the bigger picture I mean you yeah there's ownership of crypto dick butts in this now you know David supporting us well a Solana nft and you know there's you've clearly got something I mean I've been down this route for a while but there was a magic moment for me I was at Ian Rogers house in Paris and I was having dinner and next to me was like artists musicians technologists Finance people just this eclectic group of brilliant talented people and I'm like this does not happen in your lifetime yeah right it really doesn't something truly Magic is happening here and yes we're in this bear Market phase of it all but there is total magic going on and that just gave me in the I don't know when that was last December it just gave me another shot in the arm to think you know what what comes out of this is going to be massive what's your well how did you start thinking about web three more well not more than but you know as another layer to what you guys do at bankless yeah or think about yeah well I think one of the neat things about crypto is that it seems to present some sort of like Singularity about many different topics and and like areas of Focus right so we we typically there's a contrast between D5 and nfts right like either it's D5 or it's nfts but the T in nft is token and a token is a financial instrument and that's defy and and then we have like the relationship between protocols and community and this is where um I think just like everything kind of weaves together so to understand deeply whatever ever this thing is defy like nfts ethereum web 3 crypto internet money and internet what what words do we even use to explain these this thing in totality I don't know I kind of like the digital nation states I mean that's true yeah period but that's I would also say that's another way to approach the knowledge right there's there's and this is why I always say crypto has something for everyone and there's 10 000 ways to find crypto and what that what it what you see in it but to stop at Defy is to only paint in like a certain corner of the picture maybe maybe it's towards the center of the picture uh maybe but maybe that's up for interpretation but I think a holistic understanding and why people really uh enjoy Bank list because we try and go down every single rabbit hole that crypto presents us and so we go down the D5 rabbit hole we go down the web 3 rabbit hole we go down the nft rabbit hole and we also try and do our best to weave them all together to to tell the grand story that is this movement that we're all like on together and I think perhaps like one of the reasons why bankless is what it is is because I think we've done a bang-up job like weaving it all together but it's still like there's still corners and dots and data to connect and from a Content perspective it's very very rich right like why why are we able to produce three episodes a week at minimum it's like oh it's because there's so much data and data points out there to connect and so much knowledge to to share and and weave together and so it we started in D5 just because like like Ryan said like first off no one in 2018 to 2020 no one believed in crypto and then even inside of crypto 90 of people didn't believe in ethereum and even inside of ethereum like half of ethereum didn't even believe in defy and so it was the conviction it was the contrarian bet layered inside of a contrarian bet layered inside of a contrarian bet and being right about that like put it put many many people on the map and and bankless specifically but then it just grows from there it's like okay now that now that we have this Foundation of like hey D5 is Israel tokens are a thing smart contracts are a thing that just makes so many other Downstream Technologies also a thing right and that makes Dao's a thing that makes nfts a thing that makes layer two's a thing and so everything kind of spawned out from there and after that it's just been like trying to capture lightning in a bottle because like there's so many conversations to be had about where this thing goes yeah I mean I mean for me it's it's sort of a few mental models that really clicked to kind of understand this and understand nfts and you know one of the mental models is the digital nation state as you said and and a Cornerstone of any nation-state digital Nation or sorry any any kind of physical manifestation of a nation is this idea of rule of law and property rights and what we have created kind of the mental model to unlock with with something like ethereum or even a Bitcoin is uh we have created a internet-based digital property rights system and so that can be any any type of property that can be fungible property like like tokens either you know could be stocks and bonds or currencies and kind of the you know the nation-state world those are all forms of property of the of the nation state and we can have that and register those as assets on something like ethereum or it could be uh non-fungible elements of property we see that of course in the physical world too you know that your house your your apartment a collectible that you purchase these are also forms of property that are kind of registered uh by the nation state that you know through rule of law and so it's all the same side of the the coin but you were mentioning that um that that meal you had where you saw kind of like artists and you know Finance people and everyone kind of collectively together another mental model unlocked for me was We did an episode with a historian his name is Josh Rosenthal and it's probably the my favorite episode that bankless has ever produced just because it was so pivotal to like my crypto journey and he basically went through the Renaissance and um he talked he he compared where we have been to sort of the feudal system where you know there was no democracy democratization of of property it was sort of you know few our fuel Lords uh kind of um you know we we worked on their land and toiled for them and that's sort of the kind of the present day internet and then we unlocked a couple of things that led to the Renaissance and these were Technologies we unlocked the printing press gutenberg's printing press and so this enabled Mass distrib distribution of communication it was a communication technology and we also unlocked uh you know Medici and others uh double entry bookkeeping right and so you have a communication technology and you have a ledger technology and what do you get you get the Renaissance this splash of of human creativity and Science and progress and man um the roots of everything that Humanity has achieved up to now a lot of that was was rooted in the Renaissance and so now what do we have well well we have a communication technology that democratizes communication that's called the internet TCP that's the protocol for it okay that's like the the printing press and we have a new um triple entry bookkeeping system a general ledger that is crypto all right so we've got these two technologies and I think why you're starting to see what you're seeing Raul is is we are starting we're seeing the early phases of unlocking a new Renaissance myself this whole exponential age thesis yes just Builds on that it's where AI fits in robotics the internet's a thing genetic science is all of this is building on an entirely new system that has the opportunity to be a renaissance that we can be optimistic about and not fear people fear change right it's a natural human thing but if you embrace it and go with it that's the rewarding Journey 100 and and I I think that that is the opportunity for everyone I would say listening to this consuming real Vision content consuming bankless content we are at a very unique place in history right where we've just had the we've we are just I I think there's a tendency particularly among younger generations to be almost nihilistic about their their place and time in history right and you could certainly go down that path and there have been you know points in my life where I've broken down that path all been down that path look at the flip side of this like the the the the massive exponential opportunity that is available to you that like the tools that we have at our disposal right now in this period of of uh change that the old institutions aren't going to take us to the next stage in in human progress and so we have an opportunity this is sort of what we're talking about yesterday around with the with the fourth turning we have an opportunity to set up a new yo uh set of Institutions that will help Humanity coordinate better and uh that's kind of the 21st century uh technology and what uh what a gift to be born and to be alive at such a time in a place that's the flip side that I mean to me I know David has talked about this with his own uh sort of Journey but to me that is the the nihilism killer is when you see the the pie expanding opportunity that's going to get me into another thing is I really worry about this the abundance mindset that many of us have and then there's the tribalism yeah and it is I mean I left the Bitcoin ecosystem yes because if was outperforming you know as a as an investment guy but because I [ __ ] hated ecosystem right you weren't treated well if you want to join a digital nation state and they don't treat you well as Citizens you want to leave and I think we're starting to see that but the tribalism is still immense in the space and something has to change there if we're trying to onboard a billion people it can't be a group of people throwing poo at each other let me ask you do you think um because there have been those that argued that the tribalism is actually a feature I get I get that but you don't have to be nasty about it yeah protect your own and be somebody who wants their ecosystem to succeed even above others but it doesn't have to be a pie mentality it can be a abundance mentality if we all do this together we all succeed I just don't get it my interpretation on this we use this line um at bank list a lot it's like we're speed running the history of money and finance and so like the compression of time in crypto if you want to extrapolate it out and layer it on actual human history like Bitcoin invented in 2009 that's like us discovering gold on the Internet it's it's like bitcoin's great it is primitive and so it makes sense that Bitcoin looks and feels and if you like which I do except Nick Carter's interpretation of this it is a religion it is not like a religion it is a religion it acts like a religion it quacks like a religion they have religious Purity tests and so like the the and so that is where you know crypto is in the landscape of time like Bitcoin is the the earliest discovery of Bitcoin and so it's like you have your high priest of Bitcoin you have the word of Bitcoin the word of Satoshi interpretations of the word of Satoshi uh and so this is where crypto was when we discovered it in 20 2009 where Bitcoin is and then we move forward in time and space and you know very rapidly and then we also move forward in technological progress of the of of crypto and then all of a sudden we have something more advanced that looks and feels more resonant with modern technology and modern values in modern society which in my mind is is ethereum do you think though that like the the religious aspect of it like is a product of stagnation more than anything else um I think it's a product of valuation because valuation in the space is metcalf's law so it's about trying to get the most activity on your chain I guess stagnation plays into that when the market is stagnant there's no new capital coming in so you're fighting for your share of the capital you can see it in nft space as well right it's got the exact thing exact same thing is going on because there's a scarcity of capital so people become more fanatic about attracting that capital and they coalesce totally tell themselves different stories to try and attract Capital via narrative once the space starts growing again it does drop a bit but it's particularly bad in Bear markets yeah yeah it's there's there's always the hey let's grow the pie uh conversation versus just splitting up the pie and that's that's why I like to talk about ethereum's role of centric roadmap in the conversation of that pie whereas layer twos on ethereum optimism competes with arbitrum competes with polygon competes with ZK sync yet when an application deploys on any one of those things it's very easy to transfer and spread that value around to the other layer twos and so the layer twos of ethereum exist in this harmonious equilibrium between competition and collaboration and so it's hey we can grow the pie but we're all trying to take our larger slice but we're still going to grow the pie and I've don't think other communities have that like that that balance between that design philosophy like Solana and the monolithic architecture it is just like Solana the layer one they need to capture a larger share of the pie that is their wind condition same thing with Bitcoin is like they don't have this this harmonious balanced tug of war between competition and collaboration that the ethereum layer twos have like Bitcoin it in the win condition for Bitcoin is that it eats the entire damn pie and that's the same thing for almost every layer one like I think I think Ryan agrees with me that like layer ones are maximalists of themselves like they want to dominate and so how do you as a layer one win in my mind you win by having a harmonious balance between collaboration and competition and that's why I see layer twos and so like the reason why we are so tribal is that I think layer ones themselves if you apply agency to layer ones they know that they need to dominate they need to be the biggest layer one like this is a competition of Empires and layer ones are you know Warring with each other there and so the the I I do understand why we're also tribal it gets worse in Bear markets but I think the layer one competition kind of induces that I think that's right I mean I'm um working with Kevin Kelly from Delphi um to try and put together a research piece on analyzing ether's a digital Network state comparing it to traditional economies using similar metrics so it's kind of dropping all the crypto specific stuff looking at that and then looking at these other economies and look the story of economies is also the story of competition and it depends how you how you compete and how you work together you know that's the interoperability layer that can drive some of this nation this too you know Holland is a small country Holland benefits massively from being in the middle of Europe having the same currency and and borderless okay you saw there's a lot that's going to apply there's we've got a bit more work to do on it but I think I I want to try and reframe the conversation um in the market about understanding for the next phase forwards because I think people who are coming into the space particularly in the institutional investment space need a framework to understand that these are Emerging Markets we've got emerging marketing Credit Systems we've got emerging market we've got business layers being built on top infrastructure layers being built it's it really is an economy people just don't see it 100 100 that is the best uh mental model I think for these uh crypto networks is as nation states is as uh emerging economies and that's essentially what you're sort of investing in and I do think that's why we see some of the the tribalism too it was a Supreme Court Justice I believe I can't think of um you know the person's name right now but called um America's 50 states 50 experiments in Freedom and I I see at at their best that's what we're doing with all of these layer one experiments right um and and even the layer two experiments right because you see now um in 2023 there's a lot of tribalism between different layer layer uh two ecosystems even in ethereum right and some of that is good though I think it's great if you if you can just ignore delete crypto Twitter for a few months right uh or for a year just ignore all of the noise and the like the yammering the claim back and forth ignore all of that and actually see the outcome is we're the alternative layer one ecosystems are making ethereum better and ethereum is making them better okay the layer to competition this experimentation at kind of the state level inside of the the federal nation state of ethereum they're all improving each other right they're all making like it is actual uh evolutionary progress survival of the fittest experiment so we get to let all of the experiments play out so why I think um tribalism is kind of negative and toxic and when you're in the moment um you know like it is all of these things you know I agree actually I I still kind of argue would argue that it's more of a feature than it is a bug yes we don't have to be toxic yes we don't have to be naturalistic but don't try and invade other country you know it's like I agree nationalist I agree it's not fine to invade somebody else based on your own compete let's compete in kind of you know uh the right way and let's have a healthy competition as between sports teams whereas between you know healthy nation states that aren't going to war that kind of competition I think is healthy once you kind of declare a Jihad against another you know crypto Community then then it starts to get into unhealthy territory uh certainly but the net is we get to let all of these experiments play out and uh that's a great thing for the progress of this space and that by the way is why I think crypto is absolutely unbeatable like we're going to win like this level of experimentation is not happening anywhere else it's not happening at the nation state level speed and this scale no right nothing is like it it's not even close so this is why it's at some points you have to kind of step back and ask again that question am I am I crazy right it's like it's a valid question asking I keep going back to like with all of the experimentation the rapid pace and the acceleration of all of these things it's all open source we're trying all of these things all at once um it's almost feels that this could be a fee this could sound hubristic to say but it feels inevitable is my conclusion on crypto like it is going to be absolutely massive this is absolutely going to be the um property rights layer of the internet the internet a communication Network completely needs a property right system and that's it that's crypto and so if you can kind of zoom out when in doubt zoom out zoom out above what's happening in 2023 in the tribal crypto battles and kind of see the big picture here and like look at I mean you you've been here since 2012 uh Raul so look at the progress look at how far we've come over a trillion dollars it like this is it's happening weird because my hypothesis when I first saw Bitcoin and blockchain was like oh well here's the future of the financial system we need to put all Financial assets on chain to start with so we know who owns what here we are 11 years later we're not even close it's true a couple other things I didn't imagine happened which was smart contracts and nfts and it's you know we don't know how it works but you know it kind of just finds its way like Mercury it's but it's very much like I mean we've we've seen this before haven't we even with in all of our lifetimes that's how the internet emerged remember the internet of the 1990s people predicted all sorts of use cases that really you know didn't happen and it evolved in unexpected ways I mean no one predicted kind of the the rise of social networking because it's evolutionary I think to your point there's an evolutionary element that's organic about it yes which makes it less predictable I think there's two halves of this conversation we have the technology of the pre-existing world pre-crypto and when we see in and then then invent crypto we can be like oh we can improve our old Technologies by applying these new crypto things and that's totally true but the problem is you're fighting against a like a massive ship that is that you have to turn right you have incumbents that you have to fight you have regulations that you have to fight you have uh like old companies that are doing things in old ways that you have to convince to Pivot and so yeah eventually the whole world will be built on crypto but in the meantime well the whole world adapts to this new crypto Paradigm we have these new digitally native use cases that have no incumbents to fight against like brand new startups that can capture that real estate this is something I learned when I was at that tokenized real estate startup it's like Oh tokenizing Real Estate is trying to get the old world to adapt to a new a new system and you have to get new regulations and like man Like Houses already exist uh and and regulations already exist what's going to happen faster and what ultimately did happen is jpegs right like you and a swap like digital things like for there's a fertile landscape out there and it's going to be it's going to be a hundred times easier to build digitally native things that have zero competition versus like trying to get the old world onto crypto because also you're then doing show not tell so you're showing people okay here is the efficiencies of using this new system and eventually the old system migrates as opposed to telling them the need to go on chain and then fighting tooth and nail for decades with you exactly if we bring the old world on chain they're gonna be like but we need this and we're gonna like but you don't need that uh and it's they're going to bastardize like the nature of these crypto platforms yeah they're not going to use the tools as well as switch a bit the one things I want to see your thoughts on or how it's impacted you is look you guys are public like me like a bunch of us who were trying to help as many people as possible understand the narratives and then suddenly hate comes right you I mean I spoke to Scott melker about this as well yeah we've all been down how did that affect you because you you know you go from you your mission doesn't change you do the best you can and suddenly The Narrative about you changes as people get angry right or lose money or upset talk me through how it affected you guys because it can't not affect you there you go there you go yeah it's definitely not the thing that I expected um like I'm a Content producer like one thing that we we made a decision very early in Bank list is that like we are investors we're investing in this like we built Bank lists from the early days on a thesis around ether and defy and we invested in those things and then wrote Theses about why we're investing in those things and that and in the start of Bank list for the first like two years I was like great I was like everyone loved that now there's not as much uh acceptance of like Ryan and David as investors in this space while also being content producers like we have to like I feel like we have to fight for that a little bit more it's like hey we also want to be investors in this crypto thing is why we're here in the first place I don't think people as readily accept the relationship as like Ryan and David as crypto investors that are also content producers in a way that they once did um like the oh the ogs understand it because they've seen our track record through and through and through the newer the newer comers into the crypto space are like oh Ryan and David are they're biased they have Investments which I mean it's totally true but like it didn't it never used to be so critical or toxic or like mean before and so that's something that I'm like trying to figure out how to navigate we've been does it affect you at a personal level yeah sure it does I I think uh where it affects because we've been um we've been attacked at you know multiple stages of this journey you mentioned the tribals from multiple like places too yeah so I mean there were there are a few notable like attacks you know one was uh uh Danny uh Danny and uh kind of a we call them frog Army attacks because often kind of like but either it's Bots or it's people human beings behaving as Bots saying the same thing not responding to you know rational thought and of course route like the the social media Algos reward this as well so that that um doesn't cause the problem but certainly amplifies the feeling of it and um and so we we had a frog Army attack uh uh Danny sesta and that entire ecosystem uh the kind of the ways of the magic ecosystem Wonderland yeah um yeah and so that that seemed to us to be um scammer Laden fraud Laden and you know we said as much we didn't talk about that content got attacked for that we got attacked because we weren't hosting Danny sesta on the show yeah I've been through that as well yeah we got got attacked at one point in time by um the Terra Luna uh community and I think we actually um presented a very fair uh take on Tara Luna which is basically is this a Time ticking Time Bomb let's do the the bear case and the bolt case for this um and even even posing the question even asking that at that point in time in the market uh subjected us to a massive amount of attack um and by the way at one month after we got attacked by Danny sessa's frogs like a month later it was exposed that zero xifu was the old old quadranga X like a co-founder and so then that whole ecosystem like crumbled and then one month later after we had the is Tara ticking Time Bomb I've learned I try and step back from the anger yes and think about the motivation but now the Market's a little bit different yeah I think 2023 is different but what I my feeling on 2023 is um the crypto Community is in a mood and they're in a mood that's been caused by on the back of 2022 which is a whole bunch of public figures that they trusted that segments of the community trusted Alex machensky SBF suzu 3 is capital even you know like the G gbtc that cold kind of uh Empire putting money in Gemini right right like all of these things betraying trust and so we are now white blood celling attacking everything and and the reality is the time to launch these attacks and for the white blood cells to come like attack kind of the the you know the the Invaders and the bacteria and the viruses was actually 2021 and 2022. right now in 2023 that predominantly there's a bunch of good faith actors that are still here that are still building during the bear Market there's always you know kind of the you know Oddball people that are not uh doing that but and and yet the the it's an it's an autoimmune disorder because still the immune system is kind of now attacking some of the good faith actors and that's what I see but honestly Raul it does get me down particularly when uh the attacks are coming from the in-tribe kind of group right and they're coming from inside the house and you're like wow you know but it's it just goes with the territory and I think um getting off of social media for a period of time and zoom zooming out and looking at this you know has been helpful for me personally I mean I've had the other line of attack which is interesting from the old school the like you're a macro guy why are you doing Crypt I'm like no longer than most people and it's all part of macro and then it's like the market goes down and it's like you're a scammer you've ruined people's lives I'm like no I've already always explained my thesis how long term you know it's people just want to find reasons to try and unsettle you for various reasons and usually is their own insecurity that's driving it yeah so the reason the Terra Luna Community was so angry with you guys is because they were feeling insecure right generally it's a lack a lack of security or the feeling of security that creates that behavior that's why try and step back to do and try and think why why are they being like that yeah I mean I never do that it's just not part of my personality um but I guess I'm less insecure about certain things yeah I think we dealt with my wife if she threatens me about something that particular Point that's going to work your nft collection there we go yeah I do think the insecurity angles is the right one that's also like the the laser-eyed Bitcoin Maxis the ones that are really loud in tribal they get insecure because there's like things about Bitcoin that are worth like talking about and they just want to rush that brush that under the rug and like you get that about every single loud loud people loud tribes on crypto I've just learned like those are loud and insecure are like almost the same thing yeah yeah so finishing off you guys started another chapter as well which is the VC fund talk to me about that because that's super interesting yeah so uh over the course of I I would say the last three years um as David mentioned we've always been crypto investors on the journey and so we've obviously um you know uh backed that up with investments in uh some of the the publicly traded uh tokens let's call them in kind of the open markets we've also been Angel Investing over this time too and so unfortunately because of accredited investor laws and all sorts of other reasons there are projects that um don't have anything that that retail can kind of invest into and so that they're kind of in the pre-token pre-public type phase and so for the last three years or so I think David and I have been involved in 70 or something different uh Investments again this is crypto infrastructure building in the future and so what we decided to do is essentially parlay all of this into a more of a structured VC fund um it was becoming unwieldy to manage uh David myself and you have spreadsheets of kind of your Investments and tracking all of this so we decided to formalize this and spin this up into bankless Adventures is what we're calling it and so we brought on a partner who's absolutely fantastic his name is Ben lakoff and he has helped organize all of the activity we've recruited a team and so we are staying on kind of the frontier of what crypto is building and some of these early stage seed level crypto projects and that allows us to do that so I think we've already invested in or getting ready to invest in four to five different things and um you know we just finished a 30 million dollar fundraise which was difficult ish to do in in this there's no great timing although it's brilliant timing to launch a VC but as ever it's the hardest time to launch to raise bloody capital in the middle of that yes uh so it's just complementary with everything we've we've been doing as investors in the crypto Journey trying to build um tools to help people go bankless it is a crypto fund um VC fund so it's got a 10-year time Horizon so again you know one of the ethics that we've always observed at bankless is long-term games with long-term people so this isn't a type of a fund that receives tokens and then dumps them on on the community we have very long term time Horizon uh so it's just complementary with with everything that we've been doing the space up to date and keeps us sharp from a from a content and thesis perspective too because we get to see what's happening in the very early stages yeah the long-term goal of the ventures is to that like like Ryan said there's a lot of activities that we're already doing right we're already doing Angel Investing this conversation about Ventures really got started we were talking about like Hey we're doing a lot of Angel Investing what if we just hired an analyst to help us just research these Angel deals a little bit more and then we're like oh that's more than half of a VC firm that we already have we've got the deal flow we're writing the checks if we hire an analyst like we might as well just do this this thing outright and so the idea is like we we spin this thing up we pass all of our deal flow in through Ventures we hire out a team to to turn it into a professionalized streamlined operation that is dotting eyes and Crossing T's in the ways that maybe Ryan and I weren't when we were doing this individually because we didn't have the time but now we have the team to to get that done my long-term idea for for what Ventress does is that actually hopefully informs the podcast about these Frontiers that we are exploring so the idea is like well the podcast and the newsletter and Bank list media grows the network that bankless Ventures can latch on to and get deal flow from just because that that's our Network right monetizing it's a 360 degree kind of flywheel that you can build from this yes uh and then and then because of the information and education that we are able to scale through the research team Adventures like we are we are able to be more informed on the podcast but I do want to draw a very clear line that the podcast and media entities are very much firewalled from uh content from The Venture firm like they're just because you're a deal that goes for Bank of centers doesn't mean you just get to waltz on the podcast you have to earn it just like everyone else so there's no there's no like background for myself knowing that this time in four or five years time in the bottom of the bear Market that's exactly the stick you'll be beating where are you yeah people are already doing it and it hasn't even like been an issue yeah right I think one uh defense against that uh and I don't know what you guys have done at real Vision but I'd be curious to kind of uh compare notes is um have the best disclosures in the business and uh so that means basically like wherever possible we are fully transparent with our crypto Holdings and our crypto wallets and what BBC owns at any point in time the great great news about this lack of privacy on chain also means anyone can look at your address and see exactly what you're holding um having a disclosures page that is uh continuously updated um so that people know exactly what David holds exactly what I hold exactly what members of our team are holding at any given time so we just say like you know we're we're uh we have a thesis um of course we're investors on the bank list Journey we're pursuing that thesis of course we're going to we're not we're not journalists like we're going to uh invest in things that we believe in right as should you like that's our encouragement is be an investor in the space that's how to kind of maximize the opportunity and so as long as we have some of the best disclosures in the business I think that is the ultimate kind of shield and we can always direct people to there it's all fully transparent you can you can see it at any point in time you know exactly what we're holding and then we disclaim them uh you know as we go through the content yeah well I just tell people as you know I just tell because I don't I don't trade a lot I don't do special situations I'm not involved in stuff so I just tell people oh this is my rough waiting and this is what I'm doing and this is what I own and that's it I think it's pretty normal for people to be like skeptical at at front it's like oh the biggest podcast in this space is doing a VC uh fund like what's going on with that so like the gut reaction I think is totally justifiable but we're gonna do the same thing that we did with bank list which is like Nothing's Gonna Change we're gonna we're gonna be here the podcast won't change and and we'll we will earn the legitimacy once again and also you will find a way over time because I know you believe in it to allow regular people to invest in this kind of opportunity yeah that's we that's what we're working on at real Vision as well um even for the asset management firm uh which is separate to real Vision everything is all the same thing and it's this democratization of Finance and that's what we're trying to get to guys listen it was fantastic to have you on really enjoyed the conversation it was good to turn the tables and hear your stories because I think you know your stories because you're so much the other side of the camera they're as important you know you have you play an important part in this ecosystem and just to hear that I think it's fabulous so thank you look thank you for sharing your time with us thank you thanks Ralph it's been fun [Music] thank you [Music]
