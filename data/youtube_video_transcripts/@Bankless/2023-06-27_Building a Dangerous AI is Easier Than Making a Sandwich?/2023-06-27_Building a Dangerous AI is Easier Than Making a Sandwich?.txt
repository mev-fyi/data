how do we responsibly deal with powerful technology the last time we add a new level of powerful technology we did drop two nukes on purpose it's going to be much worse when we're dealing with agis and aeon especially like imagine if these things are open source imagine if every person in the world had a nuke during the Cold War I expect we would have gotten nuked there is currently more regulation on selling a sandwich than there is to building unprecedented AGI level technology and releasing it to the general public like how would you expect this to go well at this current pace
