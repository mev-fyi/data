so it's nft primer time again overpriced jpegs listeners don't need this but we are extending this to some of our our new listeners here who are hopefully learning about nfts for the first time so the way i want to explain nfts and and maybe blockchain technology broadly is ashley i want to ask you what is the most valuable thing you own and that could mean the most expensive thing or just the thing that has tremendous meaning to you i mean this is like i don't know i would say my house in la um and the reason being is because i've been working on it for like two and a half years i've literally like knocked it all down and rebuilt it basically um so yeah i mean is that like that's a fact that that feels like it has the double it it checks both boxes i'm sure it's valuable in terms of it's one of the more expensive things you own and it has uh sentimental value to you because you very much put a lot of your energy into it yeah well and and having a house that reflects something about you is actually a good metaphor for why nfts matter but we'll get into that in just a minute so your house is valuable both monetarily and otherwise because it's scarce there aren't just like infinite number of houses that are period or houses that are the ones that you've sort of handcrafted and scarcity is fundamentally what drives value the fact that air is free is because there is an infinite supply at least right now and hopefully we don't destroy the planet and get rid of that someday and for most of human history there was no way to really have digital scarcity there's been an interest in creating digital money since the advent of the internet but in the early days of the internet we didn't have a way if you created a digital dollar somebody else could come along copy and paste that create a trillion digital dollars and now that money means nothing because it's not scarce so what the blockchain fundamentally changed and this was back in 2008 was a way to create scarcity for digital goods so the first manifestation of that was money that's when you have bitcoin which folks have almost certainly heard about but what's happened in the years since bitcoin is we've developed ways to not just put money on chain and make money scarce but we've been able to create other digital assets and create scarcity there so digital art films books legal documents there's all sorts of things now that are collectibles that have value for us as humans that we can create digital representations of and make them be scarce and therefore allow them to have value so i know it can be a lot to take in but that's fundamentally what this whole thing is about and why so many of us are really excited about this nerdy new field any questions folks i mean i have no idea anything with the nft space i mean i've tried to talk to jimmy about it too and like i think we're in the same boat it's very new to us so this is kind of you know cool to um learn more about it especially because you know it has so much to do with how um we're putting our film out and all that stuff but yeah i mean i i know really nothing well go ahead jimmy well yeah so i'm yeah like ashley speaking for both of us on that i mean something that like that that i started that got my attention early on was was when i first started talking with vincent and um ray of films when they came up with uh they were kind of thinking about the idea of of nft's nft release for the film and my first question was well what does that mean what are people paying for like like i don't like i just know it as a jpeg you know and then you know they give you access you give them access and i'm like all right that's cool and then you give them um ownership um all right well that's cool like i like i have a whole bunch of vinyl records and dvds i'm like all right and then you know just like unique sort of things like so then we came up with the idea to edit a collector's edition for like the nft release um is like that version of the film is is a little different than the final version the film there's a few extra added little moments and and so i'm like all right that's cool that's something special and then these features and twitter clubhouse things and like um behind the scenes stuff like it's it's just always reminding me of like a blu-ray and like the extra features you get um but in in the digital space to put it on your digital uh shelf right um because that kind of world is expanding and expanding and i think that that's really interesting and cool to collect it like that yeah you're touching on something interesting that i think also ties to what stood out to me about ashley's answer of like my house is important to me because i've also worked so long to like make it what i want which is you mentioned like i thought of nfts as just jpegs i think a lot of people look at this industry and they look at these weird apes that are selling for like hundreds of thousands of dollars or like what the actual f why like what this is so strange uh and of course i kind of joke on that the title of this podcast is overpriced jpegs but the reality is like we all we all socially signal all the time and like you know culture matters because we like to say things about ourselves and the way we dress says things about ourselves the way we design our house says things about ourselves and uh you know we present ourselves digitally in all sorts of ways now on social media and that says something about who we are as people the films we watch say something about ourselves so we're in this era now where we can you know show who we are by the films we watch and we can do that in a digitally native way with things like i'm gonna have a film as a digital collectible that's in my digital wallet that now people can go check out which films i love i love erotic horror which i know is the genre for this film so i want to show off 18 and over in my digital wallet to say something about who i am vincent do you want to chime in here i know you're obviously on the nft side of this and like why why this project and releasing a film as an nft and a film as a digital collectible was exciting to you yeah yeah for sure so i've i've been traditionally in the art business for 12 years we've had galleries in la new york and we've we've grown physical artists careers to quite a high level where they're in museums and getting seven figures of sotheby's and crystals so it was um it was actually the winklevosses who owned nifty gateway that brought me into the space and asked for help getting nifty gateway off the ground and it was interesting to me their version of kind of nft adoption which was user credit card anyone can get on board and own a digital thing and as far as kind of the the backward knowledge goes it's okay i know that the record of ownership and transaction sits on the blockchain i know that's immutable therefore i own my digital thing with that or whatever else that could be so i thought that was interesting so we grew quite a few artists um in the space putting people uh wisby super plastic a lot of the big guys through 2020 that blew up uh and kind of proving some models in different industries as well and uh it was interesting to see everything hit but i think what the space forgot is is art and collectibles are is a niche thing in the real world and commerce in the physical world the real world whatever you wouldn't call it also does does uh kind of reflect in this digital space so as you just mentioned using i mean a board ape as your as your kind of flex status on social media it's no and people thinking the value of it is crazy no different to a tribe who thinks handbags at five grand is okay there's also the rest of the world that doesn't same way as 140 million dollars for a warhol auction is okay to a certain tribe the rest of the world thinks it's crazy so there's nothing new here it's just the digital version of it for the for the first time so what we've been trying to do is plug in directions that make more sense for for kind of a long-term use of digital um things to own on the on the blockchain and movies make a total amount total sense no one owns movies anymore and we all used to love owning movies i'm old so i remember having bought dvds on my shelf and and cool covers and cool up and we we don't have a version of ownership of film so it i think it's cool that we can now give back ownership of film and what that can be has so many more layers to it and um that's why i've chosen kind of i wanted to work with these guys on this film because uh there's built-in community here already a lot of the pfp projects are trying to build force economics forced community and it ends up being a group of guys that just hope they make more sell their things for more tomorrow than they pay today whereas i mean ash i've been talking to someone who's actually a super fan she's got like hundreds of dedicated super fans that already are the community and are already so pumped about everything she put out jimmy is is he was a huge musician uh and producer before he got into movies he's made some cool movies too so he has an audience already that wants to interact and talk with him that will that will come over so that so it's inherent with with kind of musicians and and especially um actors uh as well that the community and we can bolt all this together and make kind of the perfect version of a psp so film just make made total sense for that so we'll talk about like practically what does this mean if you're a huge ashley fan like how to get in on this like from a practical standpoint and what does it all really look like but let's let's do some fun questions and get people out of the weeds of nfts for for a little bit so one thing i know you're excited about vincent and that i'm i'm fascinated by is like how is blockchain going to change stor storytelling and what and how stories get made and told i think social media really broke open the landscape as well and has totally changed hollywood in terms of what stories get told how they get told ashley i'd love to know from your perspective you started your career long before social media was was a thing and then you've very much been an actress during this era of social media how has that impacted your career and how have you seen it impact hollywood um i mean i have like a love hate thing with social media i think it's an amazing platform um you know obviously the industry has changed as a whole because of it and not necessarily it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just i mean for me it's just a thing to kind of get used to um but yeah i mean i remember i think the first season of pll is when like twitter came out i'm pretty sure and that was kind of the first thing and then instagram and then now you have you know 50 platforms that everybody uses but it took me a while to understand why it was important and you know i think what i've come to realize like yeah it's a great way for your fans to get to know you personally but also if you have businesses you're promoting things it's just free publicity for anything that you have coming out and um it is a really great platform to you know kind of show off you know movies trailers behind the scenes um things that i'm working on like with business business-wise it's it's just it's a great platform to do but it's just a weird thing because i still i'm like sometimes i hate social media but then for things like this it's you know a very smart business kind of thing i guess did you get on instagram were you early on instagram yeah since it came out yeah and was that something was that like your choice did hollywood get it instantly but they were like get on this platform because we need you to promote the show or this or that or were they more skeptical of it i'm saying that like hollywood is one entity but no you're not i think when instagram came out i mean from what i remember it was more of just like okay we're just gonna put you know random photos of you know my day or whatever for for us on pll like i think for a lot of tv shows and films at that point it was all about twitter so it'd be like we'd have to live tweet and i was like i don't understand why we have to do this and then it's like okay you're engaging with the fans you have all these interactions and like it just gets everybody a little bit more excited and talking about x y and z um and then as instagram kind of came along more like three years later um i think that's when i finally started seeing change and then you have like all these like um tick tock whatever like it's just it's a lot um but yeah i think i think that it took like a year or whatever for people to understand um the positive side of social media and then once we did i mean it just made sense and um now obviously everybody is on one of these platforms for you know whatever they're doing but i think it definitely helps and um i think gets more viewers it gets more buyers it gets people more engaged and excited um so yeah do you think it's changed what stories hollywood tells like i mean yeah i think so i think um now because you know everything is on your phone on your ipad whatever everybody has a phone an ipad a laptop with them at all times and so i think now everything's just more instant like instant gratification and so i feel like it's kind of changed the film industry a lot i mean i really miss films from like 20 years ago 15 years but people aren't making that now because it's kind of what's in the time what's popular right now and um the trend which is a little disappointing but i i get it um but yeah i think social media has changed hollywood in a big way um and yeah i mean i'm still trying to figure it out yeah i would one of the positives it seems to me is that it does put a microphone up to like the public which can carry with it challenges but i think it's also been a big tool for calling for like better roles for women or for people of color and and it strikes me that some of the the more diverse stories that we've gotten of the last maybe decade have been from calls from social media does that feel true to you being inside the industry yeah yeah um i think yeah i mean anytime that you're on one of these platforms like this and there's something big going on in the world or whatever it's nice to all kind of unite and you know we're able to share our voices and have it be shown on twitter instagram tick tock whatever and it just gets people talking more about you know important causes and all that that's where i think we benefit you do raise awareness of the important things other than like oh look at my outfit you can make it um a platform where you know you are talking about things that people are too scared to talk about and um bringing attention to things that people don't necessarily um talk about it's just kind of in the back of our minds and so you know that's nice and that's a that's a great way for us in the industry to be able to speak our opinions but also anything that anyone says is always either backfired or you know it's positive you could be saying anything good or bad and there's either going to be a negative thing from it or a positive thing he just kind of happened but that's like tricky but yeah i don't know if that made sense but yeah it did i jimmy i'm curious for you as a director is there any role that like call it social media or call it just like the internet does it does it play a role in how you think about shooting something approaching a project at all well it definitely plays a role in in the process on a lot of different levels for example um ashley and i went back and forth and vincent and we we put together a promo for 18 and over and narrowed it down to what we wanted creatively and then and ashley posted the the clip on online and it was like over like a million and a half people in like 24 hours like saw this clip that that we the creator like you know as one of the creators like we made it and then we we we she posted it and then over a million people saw it in less than 24 hours like i i i don't and i've been coming i'm in music for a long time so i've put out hundreds of songs and like content videos and everything with and before social media you you there was only a few empire places that can do turnover like that very very very few places that can kind of like do that and now and now um like ashley's social media presence has more pull than most uh than mo than most uh um pr pr like magazines blogs you know what i mean like uh like i i can we can post something on xyz blog that's like super um successful and popular and we'll get uh 5 000 hits on something we're trying to share with um something we created and then you know actually post something on her ig and we'll get over a million so like it definitely plays a role in how you market um as far as creatively our mov the film 18 and over actually it deals a lot with obsession and isolation and there's webcaming and there's there's reality tv and there's a lot of stuff in it that kind of play on what we're talking about here so so as far as like the material that what we from what we wrote yeah we're inspired by culture and that's such an important part of culture social media and all that twitter and everything i even just saw on a side note i saw i saw something um the other day i was on instagram and i saw somebody that was like somebody i know their handle and it said xyz subscription 4.99 a month and you can subscribe now on instagram so if you follow somebody if you pay then you get access you had a subscriber badge exclusive content subscriber group chat it's like they're giving like even like the the basic social media platforms now are are finding a way to monetize for for the users to monetize those spaces to give people access to things and it's kind of like what we're using the center of t space for right like we're using it to like you know come along and and let's join our community and then we as the creators could share with with other creators and the audience um fluidly in real life and what you're getting at there with the fact that you can now subscribe to somebody's instagram and you can do this on twitter too where you can pay a creator directly or you can super follow a creator is this era of pretty intense creator empowerment where social media has put a lot of power into the hands of individuals because if they can build up a following you know you have a lot of leverage in any business negotiation you're going into if you've got 23 million people who will you know track whatever you post and i think nfts the the the reason we're optimistic about it is that should be a further extension of that so right now instagram owns your followers right if instagram chooses to kick somebody off a platform that's gone and you as the individual creator while you're more empowered than you were previously are still really at the hands of any specific platform and adam osiri who's actually the ceo of instagram has been pretty positive about nfts and has talked about this specifically as a way for creators to start owning their audiences in really distinct ways so now suddenly you release a digital collectible to your audience and your instagram fans all get that for free say and this is now a direct line you have to them and and really a communication line in its own way that can't be taken away from you so and in fact can be taken really from platform to platform um and so that's one of the reasons adam has talked about instagram has been adding features around nfts but i think it's this really exciting new era of like creators getting to not only have leverage because they're followers but also own that following in a way that's pretty distinct um vincent i'd love to get your take on this and you've sort of spoken about i think last time we talked about you see nfts as a new way to get creative work made and for i think new people to really break into the space in ways that hasn't really previously been possible can you speak to that a little bit yeah we learned a lot of lessons um kind of through the art wave of 2020 and um it's it's actually very similar talking with with ashley it was um all artists that i knew an artist that i liked i wanted to bring into this new space i thought we could turn it into something and they were like well i don't know what that was going on i don't know anything about it and then bring them in they see some things happening they they engage with a whole bunch of new collectors and it's a very close connection like you not it's a available amount of that community and uh and it and again it it becomes kind of very a lot more rewarding for both parties as well there's still a bit of it's still a bit disjointed in social media um and so these aren't so these artists trusted me with this crazy crazy digital direction and i've got some great tech some people back in october 2020 going but no i haven't got time for this and i'm going to sell it as an nft one day um but uh yeah how much money did he make it doesn't matter how much money did people make on his nfc 69 million dollars vincent's gonna be morally high ground and be like it's not about the money 69 million dollars was the famous headline he's made more than that but his his 500 days nft made headlines for selling for 69 million dollars which we should say tells you the maturity of this space that you'll find things are often in 69s or 420s is tends to be the numbers that people use so it was called to bring to similar conversation i don't know what the hell is going on but we'll trust you to run with it because i had a relationship with them before and i've done things but so it's very similar with ashley she kind of so she trusts jimmy she trusts the what the movie direction as the main creator and let's give this a go and i think as jimmy's finding now it's becoming very rewarding to enter this space especially to because you've hit on some really good things as you've talked to ashley about how social media has changed hollywood and it's not just social media that's changed hollywood it's it's everything has changed i mean netflix streaming there's so many economic aspects that have changed hollywood now it's very difficult for jimmy to make whatever movie he wants and not think what do i need to do to get to make this attractive to streaming platforms what do i need to sell people didn't make his his everydays for 13 years thinking who can i get to buy this he made it because he wanted to make it and that's what uh one and a half million people responded to on instagram and wanted to follow him even before he tried to sell it he'd never sold a thing before we uh before the nifty drop even physical a couple of prints so what we what we want to aim to do is as we did a lot of the big thing about the digital space is we took these illustrators like people like alice um a lot of the big guys that were just illustrators they will work for higher they never monetize their own creativity before and in the fine art world what differentiates kind of the fine artist or the artist and the illustrator is the fact that the artist gets to do whatever he wants no one's telling them what to do and then you find an audience for it in the movie business you have to kind of guess what will sell but now with this direct relationship with with the consumer through blockchain and the creator of the movie now the movie maker can be freed up to be an artist in the true sense of the word make whatever the hell they want to make so we're launching a few short film platforms in this direction as well for the nft space and and maybe let's spell that out for folks so and this will get us into a little bit of that nitty gritty we'll start teasing it as we go here but effectively you're selling 10 000 nfts if you buy one of these nfts you get to see the movie early you get to go to the the premiere of it in la if you're able to get to la and for y'all you'll then also when you go to sell to streamers or to a distributor of some sort you'll get to say hey look we have 10 000 people though in all likelihood a couple people buy more than one so you sell ten thousand nfts and it's to five thousand people or whatever it is but hey we have this community of people that's already behind this film it's giving you leverage in that conversation with the streamers because we have these people who are really excited about this film netflix you should want this on your platform or and you should compete with amazon prime who also wants it on their platform because look at this community we've built is that what you're talking about when you say it's giving powers back to the to the directors in the way that maybe artists have power exactly you can create what you want and build an audience for that and then you're proven to the studio so that's definitely one aspect of it where the studio won't see you as such an unknown bet because you've proven yourself you've proven you can monetize and you've proven you've got an audience and it's not just the actual number of cell of nfts it's the hype that comes around it as well because it's getting a lot of attention it was in all the press so there's going to be a ton of people that want to get in on it and want to see the movie but they couldn't because they didn't get in on the nft for whatever reason so we create hype great exclusivity for this aspect of it but from a kind of a a consumer perspective if it's if you're just looking at this as a as a someone that likes film this really is kind of the the blu-ray box set before the movie comes out and obviously we don't have blu-ray box sets anymore and if you if you're under 20 you don't know what a blu-ray is um so it's the new version of film ownership of true ownership of film the blockchain obviously gives you true ownership of a digital thing and now we can do that with film so what but what we're doing here is is a bigger version of it it's a it's a way i think we can make film work for the benefit of the whole industry for some of the points we've said but also it's we're kind of bringing it in in a way that's that makes sense to some of the nft crowd that are already here who like the pfp type project but we're not financing anything we're not asking you to finance anything there's no faith it's already made it was two and a half billion dollars to make this movie uh and now it's being given out given out to the to the fans so i use an analogy for for non-nft people this is like buying a star wars figure before star wars comes out and then when you've got your star wars figure you can go and hang out with george lucas and the cast of star wars you could you get to own star wars before anyone else does and when it comes out at the movies you get to go to the premiere hang out with the talent and then when the movie goes to traditional distribution you also get a little kickback for holding your star wars figure so and you and you still have the exclusive cuts yeah yeah so you you own your own cup of the movie you're on your star wars figure and you still get access to torture now jimmy as george lucas in discord and do some cool things um we've got lindsay palace who's in the movie coming into discord next next week we're doing so it's just we're gonna keep it going with this new version of fandom and uh so it's good for everyone that's the idea it's good for the creators of films it's good for the major studios you can monetize as a film maker earlier now in your career and then the fans get a whole another level of experience to ownership and engagement with the movie ip you you uh teased something there that i know i want to talk about later i don't want to double down on it now but you mentioned this little kickback that is something that i'm fascinated by because i've folks who've listened to this show a lot will know i've dabbled in my own way on advising like film projects on nft strategies and you know so there's something there that i want to talk about but before we go there and i'll tease that for the end maybe i've always thought about this in in sort of two waves right you've got nfts on the front end of a project and then you have nfts on the back end of the project you just mentioned like star wars well obviously more people were interested in star wars collectibles after the film would come out and that's when like the real fandom exploded what do you think the i don't know like total addressable market is in the future for folks who want to buy nfts early on on the front end of a project and how much do you think that you all benefit right now from being early adopters to this um this is so this is tough now this is again we as we did with our in 2020 no one knew what the hell was going on we're banging on lots of doors and we would sell i would we're lucky if we did five grand with selling a whispy a wispy collection um and but it was proving a model i knew there was something to this i knew there was a future and then obviously now everyone has all the artists that we worked with and made billions of dollars and they were very happy driving around in their lamborghinis but um anyway um but with moo so with movies it's it's these guys are brave to put this out there like this this is this is tough to make work and ever and there will and there will be skepticism from the outside world and skepticism yeah from the nft uh world that wants everything to be about kind of a financial instrument and uh and the monetary aspect so but we is we all believe that this is just as beneficial to filmmakers as it is to artists and this is a way to carve out that path so it's about being pioneers more than anything this is that no one's getting ripped off this direction i mean it's yeah it's it's not it won't even make the mud the budget of the movie back and so if it breaks breaks even it's good but we're proving a model and there's a whole bunch of other film projects lined up behind this so ashley you talk about this sort of fraught relationship with social media and and again digital identity is is a huge part of what nfts are really about being able to show off your digital identity in all sorts of different ways and right now we've seen it mostly in these like weird pfps that people make their pictures on twitter that everybody outside of this world finds really strange but i see it ending up where you have your digital bookshelf of the books you love and the movies you love and it's sort of bringing back that art that's really been lost because now we all listen to music on spotify and watch things on netflix and we don't own this art anymore um how how do you see your digital identity differing from your irl identity i don't know with me i really like to just um always be completely true to who i am like you know there are certain people who want to have a different persona to their following and i'm very much about like this is me you know no whatever just very real so for me i just think you know it's kind of learning and like like i said um i really only know like instagram and i don't really even tweet anymore but like now with tick tock i've seen how well that is doing and you know um with business and you know again promoting films and shows or whatever it's huge and sometimes actually you know um it's bigger than instagram because it's a completely different thing so i've now been kind of figuring out tick tock just to figure it out and i've been putting a little bit of stuff on there too but um it's interesting because you know when i go to promote this film it's like i could put things on instagram with like the trailers and all that stuff but then you know let's just say like we have the premiere next week for the nfts i can do a whole story on tiktok and get two different audiences some who may follow me on instagram who don't but um yeah i mean it's just it's a wild place to be and i think um the more they understand it i'm just seeing all the benefits of it so we've been talking about this digital bookshelf right where now you put your dvds on there and you show people what movies you love and maybe you put books on there what would be on your digital bookshelf you know have your nft wallet what movies really reflect something about you or or or books or cds um 18 and over yeah um kind of a mix of everything i think um film wise like every darren aronofsky um harmonies films anything pretty much uh dark ish um but then i'll have like you know dumb rom cobs that like i'm obsessed with like bridget jones diary i watch almost every single day because it's just like blue you know good time yeah and then cds i don't know like anything in the you know mid to late 90s early 2000s i've really been kind of hitting the throwback uh playlist a lot because i'm just kind of getting bored right now because spotify has all those like you know top hits whatever i listen to a thousand times so i'm just going back or i would have like a bunch of um uh jazz records i'm a huge jazz fan um chuck baker is like one of my favorite uh singers um billie holiday all that so kind of i don't know random mix of a bunch of stuff we also have have talked about how nfts are about changing this relationship between the creator and the fan and really deepening that relationship and allowing the creator to have a lot more control over that relationship you have this incredible fan base how do you feel like you've really nurtured that and maintained that throughout the years um i don't know i think again it's just kind of being you know myself and relatable to the fans i never want to put myself in a position where they don't understand me and who i am and um you know doing little things like going to events for comic con or even doing lives on instagram being being able to communicate and kind of hear what they want and like what they're interested in and you know what their likes are and i also get their feedback you know when we first put out um the first clip writing and over um you know that image that we used is pretty uh the first video or the first yeah yeah the first video um and i was thinking i was like it might be too much like it might be too much but again working with jimmy i've always been like let's push it a little bit further let's not play it safe so we did and we were jimmy and i were very much like this is this is it and i remember taking um or doing that scene and then also the stills from that scene that day in big bear and i was like this is the poster like this is it this is the image and uh you in the bathtub it really is for anybody who it's you in the bathtub scene an image yeah um and so yeah we put it out and you know like jimmy said i called and i was like holy like it's literally it was at a million by the end of the day and even more than that so i think it was just i mean it's just so crazy um to see it kind of explode and like certain things that you put on social media too some don't get as much attention and like other things do but that post definitely did and i think it's a really great way to get people talking about our movies taking bold bets this is your second movie that the two of you have worked on together is that right so second what works so well about the collaboration between the two of you that made you want to do another movie together well i can speak for me on my end we did the birthday cake and it was ashley and jeremy allen white and shiloh fernandez and clara mcgregor and there was this bakery scene and then luis guzman and ashley in that c ashley showed up and knocked it out of the park that's the easiest way for me to say it and in between i think in between scenes you were watching uh what's that jennifer aniston uh i watched it because you're watching it there what's that that move that show where the newsroom show what's that latest uh jennifer anderson show oh with reese witherspoon it's um the morning show i remember we're like about to call like i'm and i'm we had the cast was stacked so like i worked at that point like you know with so many people and you know everyone has their different uh kind of approaches but it's funny because i remember i was working with ashley and then she was like where i'm like alright we're gonna go and then i remember ashley just like pausing it and jumping in and she just knew it so well she was prepared she got it and like i didn't really have to i didn't have to say much like you just understood it because ashley and i have worked made music before we were working on developing another film tokyo tara in the past that that didn't that it was just kind of like our first introduction to that so we know each other um and our sensibilities pretty well and and that was really fun her scenes in the birthday cake were uh there were some of my favorites in that film and a lot of a lot of people's and then we did 18 and over and and and i remember watching watching as ashley in between takes for 18 and over and and it was kind of like everyone was going through a lot when we shot this film was the middle of the pandemic there was a lot of stuff going on in the world there was a lot of stuff going on in everybody's lives you know like it was very very weird time and i remember leo scott the editor and i sitting there and watching and watching ashley before and after takes and kind of seeing i can you can really as a director contrast how great an actor is when when they can turn it on and just kind of like just land it and and and i watched her be such a pro and be able to do it and then but then i saw this vulnerability before and after that i didn't see on set because i wasn't asking for it i was asking for the fastball and then so even when i saw that i saw a whole other layer to ashley so now ashley and i are developing a third film together which is a love story and that's basically like that's the opposite of uh kind of a 18 and over that's like how do you what do you do before before and after the take just the full vulnerability so so i've been able to experience like all different sides of like ashley even as a person what she said earlier just being authentic even on social media it's even like that with with the films and when you when she shows up and acts so for me like there's just as a director as a director ashley is the type of person you want to hire period because she's got because she's just got it she's got she's authentic she can show up she can do i mean look at the people that she's um um the she's worked with so many tour directors you know what i mean like from alex ross perry who i love to harmony corinne to like all these different people there's a reason for her you know like she's you know she's great so for me i just feel lucky that we're able to jam like that and yeah damn that's the truth that's the truth there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets

approach to the work and and why are you able to to go in and nail it like that um i don't know it's so funny um i think i think it really depends um on who you work with i mean as an actor my process is very different than other people's like i i'm always prepared but i like to really kind of go out at last minute because i want it to feel real and you know sometimes when you rehearse multiple times it's just it becomes rehearsed and and i can always kind of see that and i learned this from actually working with harmony corrine he was the first director i've worked with and i think just growing up on tv everything has to be exactly how it is on the page so if you miss one tiny word it can literally be and or whatever they make you redo it most of the times because they want every word that's written and when i got spring breakers i was 21 and um harmony would have us rehearse every day for hours a day and then the first day on set he was like forget the scripts forget everything you already know this you know your character you've been studying your character you've been being this person you've been being brit and he's like so every scene you already know what it's about i want you to improv and i had never really improved ever but it was such a vulnerable place to be put in um especially with that kind of material for a movie i mean it was you know more of a racier thing that i've done um ever and we were all just kind of you know pretty young at that point and so it was a huge um i learned so much on that film and i took away so much and even um just watching how harmony's mind works and how he sees things really changed me as an actor so going forward from that project i always just wanted to do really authentic pieces and be completely real because there's times where you know i could all of a sudden think of something and it drives the scene in a whole different direction and i and i made jimmy aware of that because there's little bits and pieces when you're in the moment and you know you're you're playing the scene out but then something could just come to you out of nowhere and it's like holy like that was a moment that's incredible and um jimmy's very much kind of about that and like he said earlier we've no we've been friends for years and um we spent many nights me going down to his apartment in new york and writing and recording and talking about things that we both wanted to do and talking about feeling stuck and like you know not having the right projects come to you and making our own stuff stuff that we want to do stories we want to tell roles that i want to play and um jimmy's been there the whole time and like he said we're about to kind of start um a third project together and this one's gonna be even crazier and we're doing it in a whole different way that we really haven't done before together and um yeah i mean it's just so fun when you can really collaborate with the people you you're working with and that they actually listen to you you know and and your ideas can be thrown out there and they can either be tossed out or it's like dude that's awesome you know so it's it's really cool to work with people that are willing to work with you as an actor not just put you in front of a camera and be like do everything that's on there and i heard you say somewhere that you started writing as well and part of that was stemming from wanting to write the characters that you wanted to be able to play because you weren't always finding them in the industry i think it really happened in the pandemic i mean i i'm still very new to writing i kind of just like have this idea and i usually call up jimmy and i'm like dude what about this like come over um that's kind of how it goes and i give them my ideas and how i see it kind of play out of my mind and then you know i give it to jimmy and he just cranks it out and creates an amazing script but yeah writing is very much something that i'm interested in it's difficult for me but um i think just coming up with ideas and having creative partners um to work with together to get these ideas made um is really great and uh that's what jimmy i've been doing now for the last it's almost a year since we started this other thing and um hopefully we start shooting uh later this year but yeah it's crazy is there a theme to the kind of characters you're drawn to that you feel like you haven't seen scripts in the industry cross your desk no not really i mean i always gravitate towards more like darker indie kind of vibes i always kind of want to go complete opposite of who i am because it's more of a challenge and you know it's fun to go to work and be someone completely different rather than you know kind of being someone very similar to who you are um but i think it just really depends um for me with the writing stuff i've been taking it from a lot of personal experience well i've been kind of going through the last three years really and putting that out there in a way that's not completely exploiting everything but you know i'll call you and be like dude this is really affecting me in a way that i wanted i want to put it out there and and this is what i want to say and this is a story that i want to tell and how can we make it work um without being you know going too personal into my life um but yeah i think i i really get inspired just by moments and things that happen to me or my friends and yeah a lot obviously no one will be writing that story because it's not happening to them so if you can make something that's really affected you personally and turn it into something amazing um i think it's really helpful mentally too for yourself to like process a bit over everything but also just extremely satisfying to play that out get it all out there and make something incredible out of it so yeah i think artists you know it's it's everything has a positive and a negative right like i think on the one hand artists tend to be more sensitive and feel more emotions and that can bring all the challenges that brings in life but there's also such a gift to being an artist because there's to have an outlet from which to express what you're feeling and express like the human experience is also like a tremendous gift to have in life yeah and carly there's a huge like difference also between kind of like what we've been doing with these films and the way we work as artists and creatives then then maybe a lot of people think the industry works um like there's you know when we're making films like this where you know we're just like you know we're freelance kind of workers we're like all right we got to come up with it we got to be responsible you got to raise the funds to make it um you got to separate the two you know um there's there's just so many and then you know you say we need 30 days and then they say okay we'll give you 15 to shoot it you know so there's there's just so much compromise and and and and you know you have there's a certain amount of leadership that that that i feel like all the heads have to have you know and ashley has proven herself time and time again as far as like being like a boss or whatever you want to call it like just like stepping up and being like this is what we need you know this is and and a time where there's pressure you know and and being able to just bring it together and when we when we're making something we're not really uh we're not we don't have analytics you know we're not serving the industry we're just serving our own creativity and we're serving our own imaginations you know we're just like this is what we need to make and how do we make this and be responsible um to everyone we work with and create a good environment and and all that stuff hearing you guys i think it's it's clear to me why this is a good fit for for an nft project and and maybe that'll get us to let's get into the nitty-gritty here and kind of leave people with exactly how they can start to participate but it's definitely like let's take bold bets we'll put the bold ashley in a bathtub you know risque thing out there we're like true creatives who want to be able to make the art that we want to make and we have all sorts of industry constraints we're working within to do that and so how can we find models for this that like again give us a little bit more leverage within that industry or just help us make it in an artistic way that we want to make it uh and you know there's a lot of shared ethos there with with call the web3 ethos which is the the broad term for nft's crypto blockchain so vincent why do you why don't you break down for us kind of in the closing here like if folks want to come and be deeply engaged in this project the chance to go to the premiere maybe meet ashley talk to jimmy about filmmaking like perfect what are they doing um so it's interesting everything that was said here because it's i learned a lot about the movie industry from this project and the economics suck uh artists you painters can do well painters can sell something on instagram that they make with canvas from sell it for 200 bucks an artist with galleries do well the economics are quite favorable for finances that we're used to dealing with but economics of movies suck and you've got all these amazing creatives out there making amazing material that funnels to a few studios and a few streaming platforms whereas everyone's paying monthly for and throwing and they're just throwing the the ball based on their algorithms it's tough it's it's you'd be shocked how hard it is for the for anything that's not a a triple a title to kind of even make its money back so so it's the best bit we've had so far for the blockchain space this is what i love about it it's a it's a better fit than our art is niche collectible things are niche we had the whole world jump on board because they thought they could make some money but now we're in a space where most of them have dropped out and you're with an audience that's into niche things collectibles and art which is more reflective in the real world but the whole world loves movies the whole world loves only movies and the whole world would love to have better movies so it's just a perfect thing to put a perfect kind of the type of art to plug into this to this space that we're growing um so this version we this is this version the movie is made so we're not asking anyone to finance anything to have faith in anything you go on to nifty gateway right now um the collection is available for seven days um it's a limp it's up to ten thousand and whatever we sell in seven days becomes the the supply it's not conventional pfp in any means there's no traits there's no artificial economics mechanics your collectible character is something you should you you want to have because it's cool it unlocks your movie it gives you access to um kind of the online um twitter spaces and discord lives are going to do also gives you access to live events the first one being wednesday at the wisdom in downtown la which is a really cool that's wednesday the 10th so if you're listening to this past that you've missed it sorry um but there'll be others this is just to show and we i mean between me and you and everyone watching we're spending 40 grand to put that party on to show that what you're being part of is real we don't need to do that because we're not asking anyone to fund anything we're just trying to prove a model here and and open up the whole world for every movie company every everyone in the movie industry is watching this i'm talking to stampede legendary pictures uh gala games everyone that wants to bring entertainment content to web3 they're all watching and they're all they've all spent they've always got hundreds of millions of dollars they're sitting on i've spent tens of millions already on web free content but they're scared to bring it here because they don't know how they're going to get the money back so with being ballsy with this and going out and putting something out there that will kind of benefit everyone benefit mass adoption for the blockchain benefit filmmakers benefit the movie industry and it's i think it's a cool thing for people to be a part of now so this is nothing and we don't want to remotely sell it as a pfp project nothing against them but it's not my with my world is art and creatives and so they go on to nifty gateway it's available now you can go and you'll you'll get to be a part of the online community you'll get to go to the parties presumably the online stuff will include some engagement with cast and jimmy and cast and crew and so you'll get access to the community of the film creators themselves right for people who are big fans of anybody who's on the screen right now yeah so i mean lindsay is coming to lindsey pelas is coming into the discord live week after next and then we're going to line up some of the other cast members and uh i mean i think what's really cool to hear from though is jimmy we had the uh and also we had the dp on on our twitter space yesterday and it's called they never get any exposure people are really interested on the front of the creative aspect behind the film why certain shots were chosen and bringing those guys in is actually really interesting to fans of a movie to hear everything about what makes a movie so it's pretty cool and we should say paris hilton is in this film i think and she's been an awesome champion of nfts and like got it early and has been very vocal about this technology yeah yeah paris paris is in the movie um she's got her own nft thing going on so she didn't want to get involved with this conflate the two which is incredible and it's not and when i say it's not her it's her people it's the it's it's the money machine and uh so that's okay that's all right um but it's cool she's in the movie there's a and uh and the audience her audience will love it because her character's fun in this movie so we alluded to this rebate this kickback earlier vincent and i really want you to maybe say a little bit more about this and i i want to be careful about how we phrased this because obviously there's lots of questions around money and nfts that has not fully been solved but i really love this concept of a new way to help finance films and get new voices heard while also the people who contribute to that having a financial incentive the way that a traditional hollywood producer would have and in not just having to be sort of not an act of charity but not just have to be oh we're buying i'm buying a collectible to support this how can i really be more like a producer in something from a financier's perspective so talk about this this rebate model that you've set up i mean 100 you hit the nail on the head there will be a model where you you you buy an nft and that is your share and you own that share and that is your producer share 100 and that will work and that will be very beneficial when we work and there's a few systems that will bring to the table in the future and obviously there's a lot of sec scrutiny now whether it's whether you're soliciting investment and so to be clear when you're saying there will be you're not talking about specifically with what you're doing right now you're saying we're not asking you to fund it so it's a different animal if we're not asking you to fund it because you can take part in the profits if you want but there aren't going to be any profits we'll be lucky to break even on this to prove the model for everything we've got coming coming behind so the reason that we did when we talked about kickback at this one it's a tiny sprinkling of what the value proposition is the movie's made everything is here we're not promising to build things in the future with the money you give us we you're simply now buying your your new version of what it is to own a movie but i wanted to show a version of what could be a kickback mechanism it works for this may not work for other products but it's simply a rebate function and a rebate in the same way you buy your laundry detergent and obviously you then giving hand in the coupon and you get some money back um it's it's the same version of that i mean you're not going to get rich of what the rebate is the equivalent could be if you think of staking crypto but we're saying we're going to reward long-term holders and basically it'll almost be like giving you a coupon we're going to give you a few months down the road we'll announce that there is a rebate available for nft holders they come to the website and uh and get their and show us their nft and get their and get their rebate um token gated website i like the rebate terminology because i i've said a number of times on this show that i think this all goes mainstream when folks don't expect to be millionaires off of the nfts they're buying it they're buying it fundamentally for other reasons but i think there are really interesting ways and models in which nfts can subsidize experiences which is sort of what you're getting at and and in the film world actually i'll give an example which is there's a guy named micah johnson ex-mlb player turned artist who's created this amazing collection of nfts called akus and akutars and he's working on on making a film with this and one idea he threw out this is not to say this is what he's going to do but it's like you sell a million nfts right if it's like it's a huge like you know blockbuster style film you know a million people are going to want to see it those million people get to to watch the the film first they pay 20 bucks for this nft whatever is kind of a standard price for you know a film premiere essentially and um and then after that for other people who want to watch it it's they will sell that nft to the next person right and and maybe they sell it for 17 dollars like maybe they don't make all their money back but they just got a subsidized experience where now they were able to watch it early for only three dollars because they want to sell a thing for for 17. i don't know that that ever gets uh you know mass adoption because i think there are a number of obstacles to that but i think that's really interesting and starting to drive at the different kinds of ways that nfts and really smart contracts is what we're talking about can um can improve the economics for experiences without making you a millionaire overnight exactly and you hit the nail on the head that the space will be real when everyone realizes that not everything is about as speculative speculation a version of nfts with d5 can be for sure but this space is we're understanding digital ownership and what that constitutes can be all sorts of weird and wonderful things we're launching our first nft documentary on on uh next friday which is a documentary about nfts by an nft artist and we're selling is nft and uh and it's just i gotta plug the project i worked on which is the same concept dan sickles it's an artist that's already in the space and we produced it it was a fun fun experience producing as well but it's again just pushing the envelope to what can be owned and why and where the value is and it's about wanting to own have it collect it for all of the other reasons or all of the reasons that you want to own something in the real world that doesn't have a purpose uh without it being a kind of a financial industry instrument um but i mean aku's idea is brilliant and there's a few other people with ideas of how to crowd essentially crowdfund its new version of crowdfunding but you own your share that's the massive difference why people say well why don't you just crowdfund um but then that comes scrutiny at the moment with sec i mean this was the the the challenges i ran into was we were trying to do this and we were literally going to issue a security and then you look into what it takes to issue a security and it's a lot it adds about a million dollars to the budget just to get through that uh those legal fees and you're like we're an independent film that can't add a million dollars to our budget and so it some of those laws i think need to be updated and and um the version where they pay for and like some a couple of people got rare ones of the uh uh um 18 and over afts a couple of people got rare ones and flipped them straight away so they bought their movie and then they flipped it to someone else who now will own the movie but without them watching it but um but that type of model that you're talking about where it can there's enough of an audience to buy enough to fund the movie um it can work because then you're just buying the movie and and kind of selling it on without you're not pitching investment to anyone um so that's the key i mean it's all these models that we're going to experiment with with that you completely are off the scc's radar is the key and the beauty of this space is it's it's a whole new world we can we can make all this up as we go along there aren't overalls at the moment which is a good thing and a bad thing i guess yeah yeah yeah well we've seen that we've seen the negative ramifications of that recently in the space to be sure i think everyone's smartened up we're kind of we've had that correct we had a massive correction in the art space um last year which was based on the fact that everyone came in and thought they could make money from flipping up when they weren't into collecting art now we're now if you go and look at the numbers on nifty maker space super rare it's more like a real art market it's not a completely blown out proportion um kind of speculative investment from unsophisticated investors pfp space was the same way and now that's had a huge correction and there are some great pfp projects that are pushing hard and built build real community in there and they have longevity i mean i mean but as much as people like to to  on board apes it's it it's an amazing brand that built and they're kind of um will be kind of a staple of of this space going forward i think they are the the facebook the the apple of the 90s and there will be a few other brands that pop up like that that seem seems crazy now but 30 years down the road they they kind of they were pioneers of the of the kind of mass adoption direction so here here's my prediction my bold prediction that i'll put out there related to this which is and hopefully it'll give folks a sense of like what i think this space is or where i think it's going like i think the litmus test is in the future right now people have their dating profiles and they'll link to their instagram account to give future dates a better sense of who they are i think people will link to their wallets which i don't know that by that point if they'll be called nft wallets and that'll be another way to give people a sense of who you are because you'll have these things you'll have your movies you'll have your your concert tickets that will be nfts that you'll have on there and that just economically will make sense for artists and i i think receipts will be issued frankly as nfts and so your coffee shop that you go to every day you know like that would be a powerful thing ashley for like your fans like see you love some particular kind of coffee shop like that would be amazing for the coffee shop and so all of these things i think will will really be where this space goes and uh and soon not soon but in the next x number of years people will start linking their wallets to their dating profiles that's my bold prediction it makes sense we'll see how long it takes to get there people are very skeptical of this space if we've got nft receipts in it i've got we've just found well you curated it we've just built an nft ticking platform called nft ticks and it's fun and we're doing a lot with it but i'm realizing some people will just want to have tickets to go to an event and that's it and it exists forever and we have to so even everyone but there will be if every receipt was in nft in 20 years time there's a lot of trash nfts just sitting around that didn't need that thing to last forever so we're going to have to work out what to do with all the nft we're going to have some really big servers because we're going to have uh some really big servers sitting places to hold all of our digital trash and uh i mean you know there's lots of negative ramifications to all of this right which is like if you want um you want things to be kept private like you don't want everything sort of on a blockchain but there's lots of ways we can deal with that awesome okay last question crypto nft is the blockchain they get a lot of bad press frankly and i mean bad both in terms of sometimes it's negative press and some of that is fair and some of that is not fair and and also bad just like bad journalism like literally facts are wrong just constantly when people report about this industry yeah uh ashley i'm sure you've had your fair share of just like bad press inaccurate press what do you think is the biggest misperception about you um [Music] i guess like when people meet me or whatever i mean i'm i'm very much like a shy person i feel like i don't i talk way too much when you get to know me and if i don't know you that well i'm just very quiet and i'm i'm very much an observer like that i observe everything um and i think people uh miss admit they they just misunderstand who i am as a person because then once they get to know me like oh my god she's so sweet like and it's not like i'm a to anybody i'm just quiet and um i think it's just because i feel not uncomfortable i don't know i'm not really doing a good job and telling myself um yeah no no i think that's totally fair like i think i think quiet people i think i think you're getting at something real or like and people who are famous people assume like oh you must be extroverted or like you know very out there and oftentimes people are not actually i think actors are often introverts and uh and that's jarring for folks who maybe don't know that and i think a lot of people too like um with anyone you know they relate you to who you play on tv and so they kind of have you know an idea of who you are you know in that character but then in real life they kind of expect the same things so when they meet you they're like oh my god you're like totally different than you know x y and z i'm like yeah i mean you know you're an actor but um and you've said you in particular are drawn towards characters that are different than who you are like some actors i think play characters that actually are kind of like them um that's clearly not the case with you okay actual last question i know i said that was the last question but i have to ask thoughts on the pll reboot have you watched it um i have not seen it yet um and you know we really didn't have anything to do with the reboot um you know from what i know it's doing well i wish all those girls um the best i mean you know i just don't have advice for them huh do you have advice for them um yeah i mean you just never know what's gonna happen we didn't know how big pll was gonna be we were kind of just like excited to do this tv show and then it became this huge thing and um i think it's just staying grounded and staying you know as close to who you are as you can like don't you know get a big ego whatever because anytime and these girls i think are relatively newer some of the actors and if the show goes i mean their lives change and i think it's really important to surround yourself with good positive people and just stay very grounded and focused and not really let it get to your head because then just goes down from there well thank you all so much this was
