how's a dollar looking from a reserve currency status dollar is still strong as far as Global Reserve currency because a lot of the lending that takes place is in US Dollars and it's a self-fulfilling kind of loop 60 of Foreign Exchange reserves are still US dollars but those numbers have declined slowly over time I think one of the risks to the dollars the reserve currency is literally what we're seeing right now with Russia and Ukraine Russia doesn't like it at all China doesn't like it the more sanctions the West puts on countries like this the more incentivized they are to find workarounds around the US Dollars the global Reserve currency and typically when these Reserve currency status is lost it's very rare that it's like you know it's Monday the dollar is the reserve currency Tuesday okay it's not it's a very gradual process that might take decades so you won't even realize that it's happening while it's happening there will be more and more use of other things over time until at some point the dollar is always going to be important but is it going to be the only currency we're transacting with probably not
