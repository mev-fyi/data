today i release a piece on bank list called the digital leviathan and this comes out of thomas hobbes book the leviathan written in the 1600s which was a cannonball of a of a piece of literature for its time right it was really important for kind of defining politics defining the and and it's very much relevant today as well as it was then and it was it was a revolutionary piece and it was talking about just the or overall role of the nation's date right and the the basic well we'll get into it we'll get into it we're just going to start reading it on and i define it a little bit of it in the article so i start this article with a quote from thomas hopps the author so let's go ahead and get started the digital leviathan nature the art whereby god hath made and governs the world is by the art of man and as in many other things so in this also imitated that it can make an artificial animal for by art is created that great leviathan called a commonwealth or state or in latin cevitas but which is but an artificial man through of greater stature and strength than the natural for whose protection it was intended thomas hobbes leviathan kind of a hard thing to read this doesn't really speak the same way i do and this is the famous illustration of the leviathan but in this article i make the claim that instead of the nation state as the leviathan ether or ethereum is the is the leviathan for this new digital nation that is ethereum a metaphysical body in his famous book leviathan hobbs describes the commonwealth of a nation-state as an artificial person a body politic that mimics the human body a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens with the sovereign leader as its head the individual constituents of the body of a nation each adds to the social contract that emerges this strong social contract is the force that keeps the individuals cohered and organized into the holistic body importantly each individual constituent of the body of the leviathan contributes their own variant or interpretation of the social contract impacting what the overall composed social contract manifests into hobbes argues that this social contract along with the rule of a single absolute sovereign was the strongest way to compose a nation a strong undivided government is what enforces the rule of the social contract and keeps the body composed and functioning this became even more true with the advent of democratic republics the establishment of one person one vote instantiated the contribution of values that each individual can bring to the health and vitality of the overall body of the nation democracy is the vehicle to which the individual can integrate their personal values and ethos codified into the social contract of the nation these are called laws digital leviathans we've talked about this before ad nauseam but ethereum and bitcoin are their own nations and each have their own respective leviathan dually composed by the code of the protocol and the individuals that use it these new kinds of leviathans have made one critical update to hobbes theory of the leviathan replace the sole sovereign leader with unstoppable openly verifiable code all technology enables creative destruction bitcoin and ethereum will subsume the job of the monarch the prime minister the president or the dictator the role of enforcing the social contract is now replaced by people running their nation's respective software the unstoppable code the responsibility of enforcing the code is shattered into a million pieces and handed off to the people the progress and developments of leviathans of old have shown that this is a desire this is desirable by the people that have composed them throughout history leviathans have discovered mechanisms to formalize and protocolize their social contracts into concrete and well-defined laws progress in this endeavor is akin to the establishment of communication and transportation infrastructure of a nation the more roads and cables that a nation lays the more holistic and integrated it becomes similarly the more formalized and understandable its social contract is the easier it is to be followed by the masses the the effort of clearly laying out the rules that govern a nation means that the nation can scale its leviathan to be a larger and more powerful beast bitcoin and ethereum are the new absolute sovereigns for these new nations we didn't eliminate the role of president king or dictator we automated it not only that but they also automated a large part of the necessary infrastructure that maintains the cohesion of the body value and value management the physical bodies of people will always compose their nation-state leviathan but value is perceived and nothing is stopping the cons constituents of a leviathan from choosing to perceive value from existing outside of the boundaries of the leviathan that they compose leviathans are not composed of people but rather what those people perceive as valuable what is the role of government other than to manage value in the ways that we collectively agree however if we choose to perceive value outside the body of the nation state leviathan and instead inside the body of a digital nation state of a digital nation leviathan the former reduces while the well the latter expands here's a tweet from ryan there will be two phases of crypto in phase one we take back our money in phase two we take back our identity the migration of value from the physical to the digital leviathans is the foot in the door for these leviathans to establish themselves as real growing life forms in this universe if they hold and manage our value we are incentivized to uphold these systems as the nation-state falls from favor have you seen the global unanimous distrust and lack of faith in institutions lately the migration of money is just the first exodus after we migrate our money we migrate our identity you are an organic nft and you leave social impressions upon your organic nft kin these impressions are already encoded in various different ways credit scores facebook friends twitter followers stream viewers the manifestation of one social graph and whether or not one can be vouched for by others can itself migrate from these current systems to their leaderless digital leviathans i don't know if you guys think about this but i think about this all the time if you go into your wallet and pull out your government issued id it expires that's crazy your id doesn't your identity doesn't expire and i believe that ethereum will offer a new identity system that is self-sovereign like all the other things on ethereum are self-sovereign identity being one of them as the digital leviathans grow in scale and capabilities it will come at the cost of physical leviathans this isn't a zero-sum game the existence of digital leviathans is net value generative but simultaneously the physical leviathans have everything to lose and digital leviathans have everything to gain bitcoin versus ethereum it's a nice little picture perhaps this spec perspective provides an answer to why tribalism seems to be an inextricable component of the crypto space bitcoin and ethereum are the president prime minister monarch or dictator of their constituents and their constituents create their legitimacy and power leviathans nations survive by accessing and leveraging scarce resources while the digital landscape available to digital leviathans is vast and bountiful it is still limited and finite at some point these two digital leviathans will grow to maturity and any further growth will have to come at the cost of the other while these two digital leviathans generates more total space more total space can still come to be completely saturated in the three nation problem i discussed how i believe the us leviathan will subsume its silicon valley sector in order to access enough information and power to be able to compete with a chinese leviathan so far this process has started with conflict as the four leaders of the silicon valley nations were summoned to congress to atone for breaking the social contract however i think the nation state will find that it is better off by absorbing silicon valley technology rather than expelling it i see no reason as to why bitcoin and ethereum won't become composed together as a more holistic digital leviathan these systems can never re become one singular body completely both protocols must retain their sovereignty to remain legitimate but inflows of btc on ethereum in the last few months illustrate the melding of these two systems into a single great and into a single into a single greater one symbiotic twins growing our leviathan we are all constituent parts of our respective leviathans and we all have a part to play in its growth and health leviathans depend on civic engagement and community for optimum development bitcoin grants round seven starts in one week by the way like infants learning to operate in an unknown environment leviathans in development need conversation and community engagement in order to learn about the world that in which it resides the narratives of crypto p2p electronic cash world computer digital gold gas defy are all these narratives are all conclusions and iterated conclusions about what these leviathans have learned about their role in the world these things are discovered through experimentation and failure how best to operate in order for in order for optimum development and health these digital leviathans are leaderless we replaced the sovereign with the protocol that means there is no no one specific human responsible for its existence therefore we are all responsible for the health and growth of these new species as we embody them and they rule over us the whole point of these systems is that they turn the tragedy of the commons into the festival of the commons use and alignment with these digital nations adds value rather than consumes it they get better with use however there are still costs to every action and as stewards of our own leviathan it is our your responsibility to ensure that your fellow digital nation citizens are upholding their part of the social contract be a good citizen we have a very young leviathan on our hands and it needs our care for further and more in-depth reading on the subject please check out this piece and i actually do encourage this this is a written in 2016 so really early um and i actually wrote the piece that i just read even before i found this one but uh this is definitely worth reading if you are interested on this it's a little bit longer and but the point of this is that you know i've been obsessed with this whole digital nations metaphor right and and the bankless nation is really just a a way to corral people into this mental model that they're in the future there's just and currently there is one single internet nation right and and now there is an internet money inside this internet nation like bitcoin and ether and then there will be internet identities on likely on ethereum because bitcoin is not expressive enough to do this um but we'll have it we'll have internet money and then we'll have internet identity and then we'll have this internet nation state that we are all building together right and so that is the leviathan that we all compose and so you know if you look closely at these little individuals you can see your crypto friends your crypto magic internet friends all part of the digital leviathan right and you know part of why vitalik's role is so important and important mechanism designers like carl florsch and um and you know many many others um mechanism designers are how we generate a protocol that turns the tragedy of the commons into the festival of the commons and so what ethereum is is one big mechanism that allows for its usage for people to use ethereum that has encoded in it like returning greater value than what you uh cost the system to use it right and so like almost we're reducing the social contract of ethereum to almost nothing because what is the social contract is is actually baked into a mechanism we no longer need um and and the leviathan metaphor is like he has the sword here so it's a threat it's a threat of coercion and violence and it's a threat of coercion and violence that we give our rights up to to the nation-state right the nation-state it rules by having a monopoly on violence uh this isn't just this isn't my idea this is this is something that that you know people uh have spoken about for a long time and it's one of the core tenets of the book the sovereign individual which i highly recommend everyone read the nation state rules by violence and ethereum and bitcoin they rule by code they rule by unstoppable code they don't need violence because they have this instead of having this subjective social contract they have literal actual contracts literal code that you that is unstoppable and can and is easy to verify right and so no longer do we need violence to enforce the people to be together we have this system through the clever use of mechanism design and if you don't know what mechanism design look it up it's like reverse game theory right it's like creating a system that is anti-fragile and redundant even under the most stressful situations right and so no longer do we need violence to coordinate people like these nations throughout history before there was the nation state there was the religion nation you know organize religion organize christianity organize judaism organize islam as the organizing force of the people and and now we have bitcoin and ethereum and it's been hard-coded and we no longer need to have this like interpretation it's just now is just straight code and and humans have always been finding ways to move away from subject subjective interpretations and into hard-coded reality and that's what bitcoin and ethereum are and that's why it gets me so bullish about the bankless nation because the bankless nation is this place that everyone understands that there is no social contract which is itself the social contract right like the social contract is that we use bitcoin and ethereum as these as these coordinating tools these coordinating infrastructure and so you know that's what gets me so excited about hopefully these decentralized identity alternatives which are all i think are are coming i think we're definitely going to get some on the bankless podcast bright id is one that i've got my eye on uh there are others as well uh and i think ryan in that tweet is absolutely absolutely right like maybe the the the the decade of 2010s and then probably also 2020s is getting value into crypto value onto ethereum but the next step is getting our identities and then we have literally a nation-state form but in the digital world right we have the digital leviathans we have bitcoin and ethereum leviathans and it gets me really excited so thank you for watching thank you for reading uh subscribe to the bankless youtube subscribe to the bank list podcast subscribe to the bankless newsletter there is a ton of gospel coming out about the digital leviathans that we are all here to grow so thanks for listening thanks for watching
