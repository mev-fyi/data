bankless nation is there a war on crypto that is the question that we pose today we have House Majority Whip Congressman Tom emmer to weigh in on that question a few things to look out for in this episode number one we ask representative emmer if the U.S has declared a war on crypto you'll see how he responds number two we talk about operation choke point 2.0 is this an effort to toke out crypto in the United States number three we talk about this issue is it bipartisan is it Democratic is it Republican who is supporting crypto in Congress number four we talk about the ability for the United States legislator to pass Common Sense legislation can we actually do that as a country and number five we talk about how crypto issues factor into the 2024 elections and what we as bankless listeners can do to support those efforts unfortunately David was unable to make this conversation he had some internet issues so it's just myself and the representative day but a few disclaimers before we get into this episode because I can hear some of you saying oh no banklist has just got political they're having a politician on the podcast what's going on I I want to say this at the outset bankless is not a political podcast that divides on red blue party lines we have no political Affinity to any party in the United States or any other country what we do care about is the values of crypto values like decentralization autonomy empower the people that underlie this revolutionary technology and so to the extent that those values are political we get political but we don't divide on party lines we'll continue to give voice to these crypto native values no matter what political party they come from so that means we're open to conversations spanning the aisle from Senator Cynthia lemus and Ted Cruz they're welcome here so is AOC and Elizabeth Warren we want to have the conversation with everyone for my own part I see value for both the right and the left in crypto and supporting both Progressive and conservative values this conversation is important to have guys we're going to get right into the episode with representative emmer but before we do we want to thank

about our next guest representative Tom emmer is a U.S representative in Minnesota and is serving as the House Majority whip as of this year that makes him one of the highest ranking members of the US House of Representatives he's also been an outspoken advocate of crypto he's rung the alarm Bell several times on what seems to be maybe a politically driven debanking of crypto in the United States of America representative emmer welcome back to bankless it's great to have you on again great to be with you Ryan uh so we don't I I think some bankless listeners might not know what the function of a whip actually is representative emmer like not to take us back to Civics Basics but but maybe start with that so what do you do as a whip what is the role actually entail so the speaker is in charge of everything uh in the house and in fact in charge of the capital grounds I mean literally everything the majority leader is the one that builds a calendar right that person works with committee chairs not only does the majority Leader's office build a legislative calendar for the year but then they actually build a calendar of what is ready to come to the floor but the beauty of it is we're number three by the Whip or uh well it is the web the majority whip and our job the beauty of it right now is uh we only have 222 members takes 218 to pass things so literally guys everything has to come through the whips office when the majority leader is building out a calendar they need to come to us to make sure that they've got the the votes that are necessary that all the problems have been solved if there are any are questions and that they can get it across the floor and that's our job to make sure that these things once they hit the floor they actually get the votes they need to come off the floor and that we've had now close to 160 votes since the uh since this Congress started uh and I'm sure that it won't be unblemished all the way through but we haven't lost a vote yet so representative emmer it sounds like the the whip is uh someone has more responsibility in terms of you know setting the agenda for or congress I'm curious how high up is crypto on the agenda in in you know March of 2023. it is uh at the top of Mind as you and uh some of your uh uh audience probably know if you paid attention what I've been doing but it's also uh one of Patrick mchenry's uh top uh issue so it makes it easier for me because there are members of the committee I uh French Hill from Arkansas has been made uh subcommittee chair of the new digital asset subcommittee and by the way that should tell you what kind of a priority it is because For the First Time Ever uh the financial services Committee created an actual digital assets subcommittee to start addressing with these issues and frankly from my perspective it's long overdue but there are other priorities uh so people out there understand this is about making sure the economy is once again growing the way it should which by the way I believe crypto is a big part of uh it's about Safety and Security both here at home by you know domestic crime has to be brought under control and then around the globe you've got a lot of uh a lot of flare-ups going on uh in the uh the world today uh that can present uh Global issues and then obviously we've got some issues with our both borders but primarily our Southern Border in the fentanyl crisis uh but crypto when it comes to the the economic uh issues I believe it's towards the top of the list but again that's that's me so Congressman emmer as as we get into the the material on the subjects today I gotta start with this question because I think a lot of American citizens and accompanies located in the United States are feeling like the United States government is disconnected from our community and from our industry and the question has been raised is there a war on crypto in the United States I I wouldn't have previously you know uh said those words but it feels like this year crypto has increasingly been under attack in various ways that I'm sure we'll explore does the US hate crypto representative emmer what's going on here can you help us make sense of this well I I mean that's a that's a much broader question if you're talking about U.S citizens who believe in the right to self-determine who believe in Liberty and uh you know the fact that their government's supposed to work for them we love it right we we love uh web 3 the ownership economy the idea that we can do business directly with one another and we don't have to have intermediaries not that we'll never need them but we get to choose them right uh when you talk about the U.S uh Ryan what I would Define that as is the uh centralized bankers and government uh those are the ones I let's just go back to 2008 when they messed up this economy the last time I because they're uh their poor monetary policy led us to a place where a lot of people suffered a lot of people were hurt that's when you have the Satoshi white paper that shows up that's when uh the Bitcoin experience begins and I believe a lot of these uh Central Bankers both here uh and around the globe but let's just focus on the U.S some of our biggest Central Bankers not just the FED but I some in the uh in the private sector we're looking at people that were doing this Bitcoin thing and I guarantee you Ryan they were going oh look at those kids isn't that cute playing with their virtual money you know it's it's like a video game that they're doing and then it goes on for about two three four years they go uh-oh this thing's actually picking up Steve there might be something here and so then they tried to kill it in my opinion their their goal was to try and stop it they couldn't so guess what the last few years they've been trying to swallow it up this is the discussion about cbdc's this is now the discussion about fed now I mean their whole thing was let's get you people and your audience let's get you on board with Central Banking in the digital age which is nothing more than a surveillance tool for government but guess what there are too many of us that say no there are too many of us that are going to stand in the way so I look at what's happened in just the past few weeks they're definitely a lot of people talk about is there a choke point 2.0 uh trying to debank uh crypto well you got to tell me I it this is this a coincidence that we lost uh silvergate uh Silicon Valley and signature uh all within a matter of days uh a couple of weeks uh I don't think there is any coincidence gentlemen uh the closure of crypto and Tech friendly Banks like silvergate signature and Silicon Valley have left the crypto industry largely unbanked and I I think the attitude of our government Regulators right now I think the attitude of our cabinet members whether it's the uh treasury whether it's the FED uh whether it's the uh the SEC cftc is all taking a negative aspect or a few of what we're trying to do and as a result I think they're risking uh sending the Innovation we've been trying to protect right here in this country right across the uh the ocean so representative emmer you're paying you're painting a picture here and something that we've talked about on Bank lists a number of times this idea of an operation choke point 2.0 but you're also painting this picture of not just a choking off of crypto but actually a co-opting of crypto as well or maybe uh the digital aspects of crypto not the ethos aspects of freedom and autonomy and self-sovereignty I want to ask you about this uh operation choke point though a little bit more so on March 15th you tweeted out that you sent a letter to the FDIC chairman groomberg regarding reports that the FDIC is weaponizing recent instability in the banking sector to purge legal crypto activity from the United States and and we've got the letter we will include it in uh in a link in the show notes what are you concerned about here so is this is this about the choking off of maybe a Silver Gate maybe a signature bank what are you writing to the head of the FDIC about this what are your stated concerns well we've seen statements from individuals across the industry including former house Financial Services chair barnik Frank the co-author by the way of the Dodd-Frank Act by highlighting the targeted nature of the regulatory efforts of this Administration to single out financial institutions and I believe to send a message to get people to move away from crypto I mean there are double standards when it comes to whether financial institutions can custody crypto not using it to leverage against or anything but just to custody and there's different messages coming out of the FED coming out of the SEC the SEC has been very aggressive and by the way uh two sources you might have seen this because I I mentioned it in an interview last week two sources told Reuters that quote any buyer of signature must agree to give up all the crypto business in the bank think about that for a second Ryan if if that's not government putting its heavy hand on the scale and doing it in a way that uh to the detriment of crypto or people that are uh you know interested in crypto I don't know what it is and then you talked about uh Marty Greenberg chair uh Greenberg uh the FDIC press release I said that signatures crypto depositors would not become deposits of the bank that purchases it right so we know that uh right after I went on this uh news program and talked about Reuters uh outing the FDIC we know they went back and denied that that was set but then the chair comes out and says look uh anybody who buys this Bank uh crypto deposits aren't going to be part of your purchase uh and then it can't be coincidence that the FED is launching its own payment Network that's literally designed to settle payments in seconds the same year that Financial Regulators have weaponized their authority to quash the major banks that service the crypto industry we don't need the federal government competing with the private sector that's exactly what they're doing and in this case they're trying to Corner the market when it comes to uh Banking and Financial Services to cut out uh again Freedom loving people who want to self-determine and make their own decisions without having to pay The Vig to the man who in this case would be your central gov government and the central banks uh banking system that it's created so Tom if in fact this is uh happening in in crypto if there is a coordinated effort to choke crypto banking uh in the United States what do we do about that is is this illegal how do we rein this in I think a lot of people listening uh to bankless just kind of throw up their hands and they just don't know what to do about it what like I mean I I know many companies are talking about startups entrepreneurs are talking about actually relocating out of the United States it is it is no longer a uh you know it doesn't feel like a country that actually wants to have crypto companies and crypto Innovation so they're talking about relocating for the average everyday citizen that lives in the US like we don't even know what to do about this we don't even know what the the mechanisms to push back is it the court system can Congress do something how do we get transparency for Regulators that might be stepping outside of the the bounds here that's a great question Ryan so first off uh remember elections have consequences and I'm not here to say that the Trump Administration uh was great when it came to crypto but it was markedly better and they weren't even favorable right some of their cabinet members this Administration has an all-out assault and I would argue it's because the modern monetary theorists you know yesterday's keynesians who now occupy the White House and are Elizabeth Warren acolytes they they have this Theory with modern monetary theory that a country that controls its own fiat currency can print and spend as much money as it wants which is frankly false I mean you can't defy the laws of gravity you can't defy the laws of common sense but you can't make that work where you print and spend uh Ad nauseam and expect that it's not going to come back to haunt you but that's their Theory and guess what flies directly in the face of their Theory uh crypto people that have decentralized Financial networks that are not beholden to the federal government that understand what good monetary policy is and don't want to continue to participate in a system that frankly is is flawed and is corrupt right now they're they that's the issue so two things one good news is we still do have elections in this country the next one's coming up in 2024. I would tell everybody who's I on this podcast it's not about being a republican a Democrat or something else it's about being an American it's about being a citizen who's interested crypto is a non-partisan uh thing it's not about your political uh leanings but it is about right and wrong and what these uh Central bankers and what our central government is doing right now in these uh little militant lieutenants uh under uh uh the senator from Massachusetts who I'm not going to keep naming I they are the the army that you're fighting and you do it for first at The Ballot Box you do it with awareness you share this information with anybody and everybody that is favorable to the perspective that you're looking in that I look at and then yes if you are a going concern and I would argue that it's not just startups and entrepreneurs I would argue that there are existing uh operations uh that deal in the digi digital asset space crypto at all that are looking to move they're looking to move to places where they will be treated fairly where they know the uh the rules of the road and I'm not saying this is where they're going to go but the risk that the United States has and remember uh the folks in Great Britain they thought they were never going to be uh you know Sunset it and then they were after World War II the United States financial markets became the Envy of the world well guess what this is the next iteration crypto digital assets is the next iteration of the greatest financial markets ever and you can either choose to have them in this country or they're going to leave and maybe maybe London's got a chance to take that back I I lastly if you are a going concern uh the courts are an option I don't know if you've noticed but uh Gary Gensler who I believe is one of the uh best examples of a bad faith regulator this guy's been choosing to blindly spray the crypto Community with enforcement actions yet he keeps missing the true Bad actors he goes after all the good people in the space and the Bad actors like uh FTX come up after the fact that it turns out they might have been trying to work a sweetheart deal with them uh but look uh there are some lawsuits that have been started and it doesn't look like things are shaping up in the courts to be to be going too well for uh Mr Gensler SEC lawyers you might know were stumbling over questions made by judges in both the grayscale gbtc case and the Voyager Finance U.S sad deal it looks like the future of crypto could be decided by a future of crypto in our country could be decided by our judicial system that uh that always takes um you know more time and I want to ask you in a little bit um representative emmer if there's some legislation coming down the pike that can save us but let's kind of camp on this because you know Bank list of course is a non-partisan uh podcast and I I would say previously crypto has been sort of a a non-partisan issue or maybe a bipartisan issue but it seems to have more recently almost splintered and I want to say this is just my observation on the back of 2022 especially it does seem like Republicans have come out much stronger in favor of a crypto friendly uh policy meanwhile we have like you know uh Liz Warren the Biden Administration also published an economic report I read that economic report 90 pages of it where basically uh fud is an industry term we use uh to describe exactly fear uncertainty and doubt about crypto and um very little no mention of the Innovation and the promise and saying the things that you were just saying about the future of the financial system the banking system sort of an internet-centric approach and possibly a succeeder to the United States from a financial epicenter perspective if the U.S doesn't get aligned with where this technology is going um has there been some increased partisanship it from what you're saying which is incredible to hear uh you guys are coming out very very strongly and of course you are a republican how does this divide among um you know you know red and blue sort of divides has there been increasingly divide because I've always seen crypto to have wins for both sides of the aisle and certainly for all Americans what are you seeing well let's before I hit the uh what is a nonpartisan issue in my mind and your your good question uh let's go back to that economic report for a second because if you read that economic report you get to the very end and you got to be asking yourself you know I was born at night but I wasn't born last night what what is wrong with this report you go through the whole thing saying at crypto saying this whole industry is a fraud is a scam it offers no value it's all play money Etc and then you get to the very end and say the future of our Finance in this country is going to be fed now in the cbdc right wait a second you just told me that none of this makes sense but your idea your government idea which is a surveillance tool when it comes to the cbdc uh is uh is the answer by the way in fed now oh yippee I I think I it fed now will probably work about as well as the post office all right uh you will not have real-time uh clearing and if you do you got to worry about everybody who's watching that transaction and scraping data out of that transaction on behalf of your government that's supposed to be working for you I I'm the partisan issue I I don't think we've lost the uh The High Ground and a non-partisan approach to crypto I think what you're seeing is you're seeing some serious uh realignment uh a political party uh uh torture uh branching going back and forth you literally have a Democrat Party and this isn't to offend any Democrats who are on this that has uh morphed into three or four different uh perspectives right all the way from Marxism and socialism back to uh the typical moderate Democrat who wants to argue about the size and scope of government versus an individual's right to self-determine where the line is but it goes the Republican party has always had its issues with a party Purity right constitutional Purity and I'm better than you and I'm more and then the religious right that factors into it so we have all these uh if you will Melting Pot of these different political Persuasions but the problem we have is the country's only two teams right for politic political purposes it's Democrats and it's Republicans and right now there's a democrat in the White House that uh his his the people that wear his jersey and I know some people who are on this uh podcast listening are going to go when are people going to rise above that I get it I get it but you've got some good Democrats I'm going to tell you right now and by the way their political persuasion probably leans even farther left than uh I would care to acknowledge but it's not about their political leanings just like it's not about Tom Emmer's political leanings this is an area of Finance that literally defines our freedom it has up till now if you look at the first 240 some years of this country it's about the finance but really about the last uh 70 85 years of experience it's about the ability for Americans to be mobile right to climb the uh the ladder of prosperity by the way to fall off the top of that mountain and climb back up but it's been all done with uh paper currency and gold Etc well we just got the new version this is digital gold right this is a this is the same Concepts it's for Value people are going to uh assign it value and and use it as a medium of exchange and this new area is all about people being able to get Capital to expend Capital to grow new ideas to improve their lifestyle I got news for you that's not a Republican or Democrat thing that's an American thing and whether it's Richie Torres whether it's Darren Soto who I do a bunch of different bills with whether it's rokana right I mean you've got Democrats on the other side that are pro digital I I think you got to be a little patient with them and I'm not here to uh to defend them but I think you got to be a little uh patient with them because maybe they are measuring their words because they happen to be under a democratic Administration that they disagree with but just because you don't see them you know being a rabble Rouser and attacking and throwing bombs at their own Administration doesn't mean these people are literally working hard under the radar trying to move the people in the White House to do the right thing quite frankly this is what frustrates me with uh Elizabeth Warren all right Elizabeth Warren if she truly believed in the American value of self-determination if she truly believed in an individual's right to make their own decisions which she claims she would Champion crypto she would Champion digital assets instead it's very clear to me that she's nothing more than a big Central Bank uh Power hungry uh leader who sees her power essentially being deluded and taken away by this decentralization of our financial system and our financial transactions Ryan she's desperately along with the establishment the institution she is desperately clinging to hold on to that Central Banking thing because that's where their power is uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a

notes or you can go to Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February I know representative emmer that um you know some of the rhetoric coming from the side being sort of a pro regulation anti-anti big Bank you know what's interesting is there are a lot of wins for crypto in that side of the argument I mean auditable transparent code that is on the internet uh you you you have the transparency offered by the SEC and cftc that's baked into the code and that is all available on chain and you talk about disrupting the banks and and giving all Americans access that's what this technology really does yeah so it does seem like there is an acid test going on this this is sort of what we said every country is going to have an acid test to see whether they really believe in the values that that they say and they purport to believe in but let me ask you this I think most listeners that are listening to this episode what you talked about is exactly what they want from our legislators is we just want a common sense who cares about a red team blue team we just want a common sense approach to this Innovation why can't we treat it like the internet in the 1990s where both teams kind of rallied around this and said this is a technology that is going to change the world and can be good for the United States we had with the birth of uh massive economic prosperity already in the United States as a result of that technology are we are we close to any legislation any Common Sense legislation coming out of Congress on any issue whether it's stable coins whether it's whether it's something else what how do we get there well all right interesting and by the way as you're talking Ryan I'm thinking about the fact that yes we had the internet I yes it exploded during what some economists have referred to the uh economic boom period the largest uh growth of of uh economic growth the world has ever experienced it was like 25 years from the end of the 80s until the turn of the century bottom line is we've got the same opportunity here the difference we got 32 trillion dollars in debt in this country we've got to figure out how to balance our budget and then guess what you want crypto and everything associated with it to grow here to innovate and grow here because that will grow the economic pie for everyone Republicans Democrats that's the only way I'm going to tell you right now my belief is that's the only way that you can deal with the 32 trillion dollars in debt the the only other way would be to clear the country bankrupt and go into reorganization and tell people that they're going to take haircuts for deaths and we're going to pay this back we're going to prioritize that you this is a company this the United States of America that has not been managed well uh crypto is a big part of the answer I believe in how you grow it but the the uh the appetite for legislation on the house side is huge on the sentence side I'm hearing it's not I'm hearing that uh people uh shared Brown others are really uh putting up roadblocks uh and perhaps that's because they're too close to Liz Warren right I I don't know the answer to that question but this in fact just came up within the last week that while there's an appetite in the house to uh perhaps talk about stable coins again there is definitely going to be a move to pass markup and past the uh the federal ban on Central Bank digital currencies Patrick McHenry told me uh that he thought that was a no-brainer we've got bills like the Block tour blockchain regulatory certainty act uh which confirms that uh blockchain entities that never custody consumer funds are not money transmitters and it may sound very simple to some of your listeners but the thing you have to understand is this effect miners this affects all software developers in every state requires a money transmission Money Train transmitter license it's just another obstacle that's unnecessary and frankly uh not related to the work that's being done we've got the Securities Clarity Act which I think I've offered now three congresses in a row that provides a framework for the SEC and token issuers to easily determine when a token is offered as part of a Securities contract and by the way when it's not the biggest issue and I can go through all of the stuff we've put in but I've been talking about this for almost seven years now the biggest issue is we have to figure out how to define currency how to Define commodity and how to define security that's not going to be perfect but Congress needs to put those uh those guide guard rails in place those Frameworks in place and we need to do it quickly because we're losing out on this Innovation by not you know entrepreneurs want three things right they want Clarity they want consistency and they want certainty they want three things and Congress has an obligation to provide it I'm telling you the house has an appetite to do this I think McHenry told me this will be coming uh I believe in I'm kind of waving at Lizzy back here because she's on the staff level always talking to his staff but my understanding is after we come back from the Easter uh break that there's going to be more movement in the house Financial Services committee barring more surprises from the central banks uh right from the central banking system God forbid hopefully that stabilized but uh assuming we are on a normal track I Ryan look for more of that uh come April and May well we are counting on our legislative branch of Representative emmer uh it feels like other jurisdictions are even getting ahead of Europe has gotten their stuff together with the Mika legislation so now America is in a place where it catches up so we're counting on you guys let me let me close with this question of Representative emmer so I don't think crypto has ever been been a major election issue in sort of a presidential election but in the next you know a year or so we're going to have another one of those do you think crypto will have a role to play in the 2024 election cycle and if yes how do we get our voices heard I think you guys die you guys are going to determine whether you play a role right uh you can either complain about all the the ridiculous things that are happening or you can stand up and do something about it the way you do that and this is for everybody who's listing one uh find a candidate uh city state you know local is where I'm going Federal I think the federal is probably going to be the most important although your states are all starting to get into this area as well uh second don't uh volunteer so if you find a candidate that you like support them financially help them get their stuff out volunteer you know they used to tell us when I went to church time talent and treasure right give them your time if you got a special talent you guys build websites that sort of thing you know how to do direct advertising all the rest uh and your treasure uh the other thing that I don't want any of you to miss because we need more of you run for office go in put your name on a ballot you want to make it an issue make it an issue the issue that most people are concerned about in this country right now is the economy and their future yes they're worried about their safety in their Community they're worried about the uh you know potential conflicts with China they're worried about Ukraine they're worried about all kinds of things around the globe but first and foremost it starts with their uh

where uh you know it's it's uh I don't I don't believe in it Etc and he finished the statement by saying and you know we've had gold for uh you know thousands of years but that we've all agreed that that's uh whatever it is well okay that's waffle right I mean this is that we're talking about virtual gold and you guys are gonna have to drag you're gonna have to drag the uh the older generation
