what is the chappella hard Fork what does it do for ethereum and why is it significant the most obvious thing that chappella brings is the introductions of withdrawals on the beacon chain today if you launch a validator on the beacon chain you're basically depositing your funds into a smart contract but then there's no way to actually get your funds back out on the execution layer so the main thing we're introducing with chappella is allowing validators the ability to withdraw their stake there's a couple other small changes that we're introducing as well but this is really kind of the big one
