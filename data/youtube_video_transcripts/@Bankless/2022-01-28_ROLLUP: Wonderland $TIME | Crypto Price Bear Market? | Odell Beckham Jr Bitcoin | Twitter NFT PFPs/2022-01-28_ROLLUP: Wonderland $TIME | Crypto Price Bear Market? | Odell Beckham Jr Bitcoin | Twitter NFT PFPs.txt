news time david oh boy are we ready to get into this here we go this is going to be a mess let's do it what do we even talk about what are we gonna call this how do we even start hey guys it's the fourth week of january david what time is it ryan it's the friday weekly roll up where we roll up the entire week in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor especially this week um some some drama has gone on this week so we're going to cover all of that and more because it's the friday bankless weekly roll up i don't know where to start with this roll up david but i i think it's got to be somewhere with bear market okay because we've been feeling some bear market vibes after we hit the stop record button after the last podcast something happened in the market we're gonna discuss it it was not good it was down only it felt like it was the biggest oof we've seen thus far yes stacked oofs uh massive raises as well that's still happening so we'll talk about that um arc investments kathy woods firm has been on the podcast she just put out some insane price targets for bitcoin underneath i guess they're not bullish we'll talk about that report pretty much they are very bullish yes excuse me they are not bearish they are very bullish hayden adams got cancelled by his bank is hayden adams going bankless we'll talk about this banklessness and what about this this last one this is some of the drama you were alluding to so ah man a lot of different names here blasts from the past quadriga was a canadian exchange apparently the co-founder of the shady exchange popped up uh on the radar he's a multi-sig manager for some pretty large d5 projects who knew we got to discuss that as well uh an ex-convicted felon for identity theft is now discovered as the anon multisig signer for the wonderland project uh and a lot of drama is currently unfolding as ryan and i were prepping this agenda so we're going to do our best to unpack all of that story uh it's some some drama drama this is crypto right it's like bear bull markets um you know changing the world all this amazing thing people making money and then we've got like just entertainment some people are here for the money some people are here for the tech some people are here for the political change some people are just here for like the popcorn and entertainment because that happens on a weekly basis as well and i feel like it's one of those weeks too yeah so definitely grab your coffee because we have a lot to go through and if it's for some reason in the evening time for you also grab the popcorn because it's gonna be one of those coffee and popcorn bowl all right we gotta start here david because you know the last couple of roll ups we've been talking about uh tax optimization stuff and i got this from odell beckham jr do you know who that is ryan he's one of my favorite athletes uh as you know he plays he plays sports okay he plays sports well um he started getting his sports paycheck in bitcoin i think this happened last year maybe the year before anyway here is uh here is a tweet from an article on november 12th odell beckham jr signed a deal with the rams worth 750k nice he announced he would take that in bitcoin at that time bitcoin was worth 64 000 today it's worth thirty five thousand dollars today that deal is worth four hundred and twelve thousand dollars that's where things get interesting so he lost fifty percent because bitcoin went down but you know holders are holders bitcoins are big corners still okay one bitcoin equals one bitcoin but here's the problem okay it's taxes come in david odell will be taxed on the 750 k and the federal in california state tax is about 50 so that means net odell has only made 35 000 k or 35k excuse me from the rams contract this year so he went he signed a deal for three quarters of a million dollars and his net on that is going to be 35 000 because ryan you know what he didn't do he did not optimize his taxes he did not optimize his taxes david that's why we talk about this uh and you know what i'm just gonna fit this in because uh crypto ira is something that i think people need to have and this wouldn't have worked for adele junior's case but this could work if you're a retail investor because it is a tax free account taxed deferred until you retire so any trades in and out any income you receive to this account any staking anything like that is tax-free you don't have to pay it uh and i've set this up a couple of years ago it was a lot harder back then but crypto ira alto ira has created an easy button for this so i encourage everyone listening as sort of a tax optimizer reminder don't be like odell beckham okay figure out your taxes this is one step you can take it's one small step you can take open up a crypto ira start depositing roll over a previous 401k start depositing turn that into crypto and you don't have to worry about this you don't have to pay taxes uh you can find out more at altoira dot com slash bankless and check that out there you go taxes for the day yeah don't don't lose 95 of your paycheck to uh to depreciating crypto and taxes that's such a bummer man sorry odell i'm sorry that happened sorry guys uh let's talk about markets though david this is the sad music bear territory we are down down down what's bitcoin bitcoin start of the week at 43 000 and has gone down twelve percent uh hit a low of thirty three thousand five hundred dollars so almost down a whole ten thousand dollars and it's currently at the price of thirty six thousand two hundred dollars uh oof oof it gets worse it gets worse it gets worse ether the start of the week at 3 250 hit a low of 2 200 and uh 220 down a full thousand dollars on the week uh we are currently clocking in at two thousand four hundred and fifty dollars down a massive twenty percent on the week rut bro row we'll take a look at that from all-time highs in just a minute here too so uh bad going down people feeling bearish um i think a lot of people have started capitulating and saying that this is a bear market maybe we should define that in a little bit but before we do let's talk about a few more numbers here each bitcoin ratio is going down as well what happened this week yeah when markets go down the east btc ratio goes down we started the week at 0.075 we are currently at .067 so down a pretty significant chunk on the seven day bear market indicator as well and the bed index that's got to be a story of down as well yeah start of the week at 123 dollars currently clocking in at 98 oh wow it's up from when i report uh wrote down these notes but still down uh 13.6 on the week not as down bad as eth is but uh still down on the week so uh let's talk about this i i put out this like you know twitter survey are we in a bear market now 60 of those answered said yes 40 said no what do you think david are we in a bear market i don't actually think people are allowed to according to markets right markets determine whether we're in bear markets not not twitter polls but sometimes it doesn't really matter just sentiment is like when people are feeling bearish bearish just kind of begets bearishness right so like now that we've been talking about being bearish on this podcast for like the last five minutes everyone else is probably feeling really down embarrassed right like these are how like market psychologies kind of work uh so bear market is it's a vibe it's a feeling um do you feel like we're in a bear market i actually don't you don't feel like we're in a bear market we're up on the year we're up on 365 days by a lot by like two okay not not up since january but uh yes yes would definitely it depends on your your your holding horizon doesn't it i mean uh do you do you remember back in the days of 80 eth yes wasn't that long ago still less than two years ago that that was going on really yeah oh yeah eighty dollars in march twenty twenty twenty twenty yeah do you remember all right less than two years also march 2019 also march 2018 80 like three times but so i think like you know we've said before under 3k eth we're not feeling great in general so this is you know not feeling great the question is how long does this last and how low do we go right that to me is kind of the definition of the bear it's like sentiment on twitter just changes on a dime but the question is is this another crypto winter or are we gonna come out of this uh arthur hayes uh founder ceo of bitmex actually wrote a great post and uh you know he's a trader but like has i think some insight into this sort of thing that that we can glean you could read the entire post it's a link in the show notes but he he talks about resistant level resistance levels of 28 500 bitcoin price for eth and 1700 uh sorry 28 500 for bitcoin and 1700 for eth and he says i don't believe in the bottom until these levels are retested if the levels hold amazing this prong has been met if it doesn't then i believe a mega liquidation candle will happen in the 20k to uh 28k range for bitcoin and the 1300 to 1700 range for ether uh and then he goes on to say if we breach the previous all-time highs which were 20k for bitcoin and 1400 for ether respectively he doesn't even want to think about it so that's like a worst case scenario then it's like down down down but he feels like we're gonna test resistance at these levels 1700 for eth 2800 for bitcoin before all is said and done what's your take on this oh i also don't want to think about it can we move on well what do you think do you think this happens how long how long is this going to last there's there's a sentiment that i've had where like bear markets are when like you you see the market coming to a decision point and it just always goes down and we've kind of seen that happen like three times over the last like three four weeks so it's like oh and it goes down and it goes down um but like we're also just following macro like the difference between this bear market bear market is downtrend versus uh the last one is like the last one ether went from like six dollars up to 1 400 on this fake ico phenomenon meanwhile what's happening right now is that the federal reserve which is completely an exogenous to crypto is raising interest rates and doing quantitative tightening uh and so like it's less not not to say that crypto prices didn't get out over their ski tips uh they were pretty high four thousand eight hundred each dollar ether pretty high like sixty nine thousand dollar bitcoin nice but also pretty high um but like it's not like it's much more that kind of felt much more real crypto feels much more real this time and now this this uh market pullback is simply just because the federal reserve is making the price of money higher and so it's really a function of we are tied to macro and as soon as the s p stops going down crypto will stop going down probably knock on wood different flavor different different flavor of why down 2018. yeah i i'm going to take on that later we'll say that to the end but uh a few other things to do the carnage this week the top 10 coins down by percentage from all-time high i always think these numbers are interesting doge is down 83 from its all-time high these are sorted in order ship token another dog token down 77 percent uh cardano down 67 percent solana 65 percent avax that's avalanche 61 eth in the middle of the pack 52 down from all-time high bitcoin 50 finance 49 matic 47 luna 41 so it's quite a spread yet um you know the coins you'd expect like ether and bitcoin they're kind of in the in the middle of the pack you'd expect them to be leased down from all-time high and actually matic and luna and binance are the least down from all-time high so i think that's interesting to track as we get into the bear market only 50 down you know only 50 percent oh there's a silver lining david 50 we've seen that before in previous dips the typical average crypto dip is somewhere between 20 and 40 percent and this dip is significantly higher than that but also like we've seen 50 pullbacks before for bitcoin david for bitcoin yeah four times in the last four years yeah so it's like it's an annual tradition like we all know crypto's volatile like this there's i think there's plenty of like rationale to say that like this is just the one big pullback um granted like bankless is known for being perpetually bullish and so maybe like i have infinite amounts of conviction for for crypto and sometimes that blinds me to short-term price movements and uh lack of willingness to accept just hold through them though who cares like there is there is actually a silver lining and i think we were talking about this a little bit which is like uh 50 pull back you get to see who the tourists are and who the settlers are right and the tourists start to get scared they start to leave okay the settlers that know why they bought with conviction they're the ones who stay and it gets a lot less noisy yeah i think you've got some lessons at the end we'll share in the takes section uh but let's look at our friends in the equities world stonks what are we doing here man uh that's pretty volatile nasdaq investor sentiment is worse now than it was in march of 2020 during the big liquidation candle back then and historically when everyone is like oh it's a bear market it turns around uh and so you can see that red line down in the bottom corner uh the just the market sentiment is so in the gutter uh and typically like look look at look at how low it was the last time it was this low it was literally the bottom of uh the the march uh dip that where there was a coveted crash it covered and then it was up only from then on out right so you know it's kind of weird that all of this uh much ado given you know because of jerome powell because of the fed intervention you know raising rates uh and just even whispering the raise of rates this is a stat on the s p it had a really bouncy day i think this was january 24th so a few days ago what happened that day yeah so we had the the this is the day where uh bitcoin and ether bottomed and then also researched just a little bit and the tweet this tweet says the s p 500 has recovered from an intraday loss of more than four percent only three times um january and so in october of 20 of 2008 and again in october of 2008 again i guess the housing crisis the the s p went down negative four point five percent and negative two point uh four point two percent respectively and then also respectively closed up four point two percent so an intraday move of eight percent and then one point two percent the next time uh and so uh the uh in january 24th uh like three days ago the s p 500 went down more than four percent and then recovered positively we had a great day which is crazy uh so and and then yeah only like crazy crazy volatile moves markets don't know what to do at this point uh even stocks up and down don't know where they're going uh we'll uh we'll see how that continues in the future but let's talk about some happier news which is a d phi metric still knocking out of the park unistop flop just crossed a milestone they they now have greater eth and stable coin volume than coinbase and binance love it okay so it's happening decentralized exchanges are taking on the centralized exchanges i think that's great news from a big picture perspective some other things going on fandom is becoming the third largest d5 protocol by value locked i consider that sort of a i mean it's its own layer one it's sort of a side chain very small um set pool of validators uh but they are on boarding more people to crypto as well and uh some projects surged 52 last week uh you know to to bring the total value locked to all-time highs on phantom any thoughts on that david um no thoughts congrats to phantom overtaking binance smart chain no easy task uh coinbase is listing solana ecosystem tokens as well and i think this is part of their attempt to just list everything and just be like credibly neutral and uh be listing maximalists and not maximalists to any particular chain any thoughts on that david yeah the hard part about this is that um solano tokens aren't erc 20 tokens it's its own standard and and it's easy for coinbase to just add another erc20 token because they already have all the implementations it's just like add a new contract address which is similar to anything on the evm like avalanche for example here c20 um solano tokens are a different different beast because of how they just are a completely different standard than the evm uh so that's why uh solano tokens haven't really been able to get on the coinbase exchange up until now and coinbase is now signaling that hey we're working on getting the solana tokens on a coinbase so really important step for growth for this alana ecosystem arc invest has taken a hit uh from from a stock price but they put out this fantastic report and it was their big insights report i believe for you know 2022 what's going to happen in the future they are of course we talked to kathy wood a few months ago just um bullish exponential growth curves bullish technology in general and the largest section of their report was actually on crypto what were a few highlights from that david that we should talk about uh the price targets ryan i think that's the whole they have a fantastic report that covers so many different things but of course since we're in the market section we want to talk about the price targets of what they predicted bitcoin and ether to to do so they say they won one bitcoin could exceed one million dollars by 2030. that is eight years so according to arc how what's bitcoin at right now thirty three thousand dollars that thirty three thousand dollars could turn into one million dollars by the end of twenty thirty if you hold it if you have that that's that's the hopi and bankless listeners sign up for arc is also saying that ethereum's market cap could exceed 20 trillion dollars in the next 10 years uh and so for those that want to do that math that's a 180 000 ether 180 000 per ether and that these two predictions put bitcoin and ether roughly at comparable market caps uh she uh kathy wood and ark says that uh bitcoin will have a 21 million uh trillion dollar market cap by 2030 and then they also say that ethereum will have a 20 trillion market cap in the next 10 years so just two years longer than that so comparable market prices are they more bullish than us david what happened here is that the trail flipping couldn't be 20 trillion is a big number my price target for ether is infinity ryan there you go all right guys we will be back with the releases of the week the hot news items everything else you come to expect from a roll up but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible polygon is ethereum's

start here with this release in the midst of the bear market when prices were were getting slammed if this is the bear market mine we're not in the midst of the bear market i guess this comes ahead at the beginning of it uh twitter just released a pfp profile feature to link your nft to your twitter profile instead of the the classic twitter circle for profile it would be displayed as a hexagon so they released this fantastic commercial that we're looking at right here and the feature simultaneously uh how big of a deal is this it's just lovely to see web 2 platforms adopt web3 stuff uh this isn't in my mind i'm a little bit underwhelmed by by this but i'm also just it's not going to just be a negative nancy and just say hey twitter nice job for doing nft verification um there are some kinks that need to be worked around in the sense that like i can just like take a take a screenshot of a jpeg mint that as an nft and then boom i have a hexagon with my fake fake nft and it's kind of like it's kind of like a workaround but like then you can like talk about verification via openc apis stuff like that it's a great fantastic first step people are loving it people having a fantastic time uh not everyone though there's been some pushback like some yeah there's been a little bit like if i see a hexagon you know i just automatically unfollow have you no i'm not not from not from the crypto people though not at all oh well them from the ant from the from the like we hate nft type community sorry uh there's been that sentiment but like okay so um did you do it have you actually tried it well no because my my uh profile picture is my crypto punk but with some photoshop stuff going on so like i have i have my cool cat hanging out on the hat of my crypto punk uh and so like that's not an nft that's two of my nfts so i've decided to not not do that so i did it and there's some other downsides too you have to have twitter blue which is like this premium service i've never looked into it until now i just wanted that to try it one of the hexagon because it's a new crypto feature so um i do think that twitter can't always charge for nfts like i think this is going to be table stakes every social media platform will have to include this uh for free just to be competitive um the other thing i would say is the other reason i do think this is a big deal david and even this is just a very small step is because look twitter has 400 million monthly active users okay and like we talked about memetic desire uh you know like when i see someone with a hexagon profile uh photo like i want that too i want to do that too and so i do think that there's this again this is another example of web 3 using web 2 to propagate itself and that is also bullish i'm also seeing like we saw meta last week facebook instagram say they were going to add nft features um just this week we'll get to it youtube adding nft features in the future so this is also going to have all the other social media platforms bandwagon on to this feature set and add nft and crypto features so i think that is good too uh okay so that goes this was a fun little twitter spaces where uh this was the the something about the lemons nft project uh i can't remember the full name of the lemons uh but so there was a twitter spaces and two people showed up with the same nft as their profile picture wait where where is it on the on the right side yeah um the lemon with a little head and what is a circle one's a circle and one's a hexagon so you know who's got the real one there's an imposter among us oh that's that's great that's very cool and it is great that it that it uh validates uh directly on chain little lemons look reddit as well here's the tablespace you were talking about yeah yeah the table sticks i was talking about so reddit is apparently working on nft profile pics as well everyone's going to do it um very cool to see that happening uh david this was another cool feature rollout from the makers of etherscan yeah i saw you having fun with this i was having a great time with this this is called a block scan chat and uh what's cool about this is you can basically just send a message from your etherdress to some other etherdress so you're like davidhoffman.eth right david yep so i sent you a message did you ever respond oh it that goes to my argent wallet i need to get my emails sorry that's why okay so i just had fun because like it's just you you know log in with an etherdress if you have meta mask or something and i have one that's called bank.ethe is my ens address and i just started like dming some people i know so i just like dm dc i uh dm'd anthony cesano i dm'd you somewhere in here i think like this is dc a little back and forth dc uh i didn't know it was him at first like i had to actually label his e and uh this is what he replies he's like hey i'm launching a new one eve giveaway please send me your seat phrase to enter yeah no i was like okay it's my first spam it's my first spam message and i'm going to block this account so i blocked him and then like i tweeted out that i blocked it and he was like hey why'd you block me um so anyway it was just fun going back and forth with people actually uh vitalik i sent one to vitalik.eth is honey i asked him and he replied i think it's bunny personally that's pretty funny that's pretty funny classic vitality go back to dc's uh chat with him cause uh you say uh wait what'd you say um did we talk i hope we didn't talk bad about you david i don't know no i'm about to talk i'm about to make fun of dc uh you say we're living in the future dc and dc goes ha ha strong 1992 feels i was born in 1992. there you go dc investor oh man that's great yeah you know dc always talks about like uh when you did that layers zero with him he was talking about like the birth of the internet being very much like the birth of crypto and i was just thinking like does david actually understand this how much of this is he picking up i had i had a name i had a name account there you go you have an eighth account this is aim this is ethereum instant messenger uh so super cool experiment that just rolled out you guys can try it um this is another one david what's uh this sos sos market dot io a new prediction market on the scene so in addition to poly market we now have sos market which has prediction markets for stuff uh so check them out if you want to go bet on stuff a lot of ways to bet on stuff in crypto that's for sure uh i'm bullish on this so opera just launched a dedicated crypto browser okay opera as a browser has like one two three percent of market share so it's not widely used uh but they are going all in on crypto features so imagine if metamask was also a web browser how much more usable how much more you know extensible would it be rather than an extension and that's what opera is doing here a brave is doing some stuff and i think you know chrome and firefox they're going to be late if they don't join on the bandwagon as well so it's good to see opera innovating here right now this is in beta i've used it it's okay it's kind of clunky i can do some of my d5 stuff but not all of it but i'm sure it'll get better in the future anything to add on that david moore wallace is always better google should just buy metamask google should buy metamask yeah i don't want that david they'll kill it i don't want them to buy metamask well they got to do something and they have infinite money so that's true now consensus does too we'll be getting to that shortly but let's talk about this robin hood is doing something what are they adding robin hood deploys beta crypto wallets allowing select customers to transfer off platform which is a very needed feature so that you can about damn time yeah you can actually withdraw the crypto assets that you buy through robinhood rather than just buying exposure you can actually buy crypto assets uh imagine that this is them trying to catch up to like the rest of the crypto ecosystem um but a really important feature to you know unlock because they're they're printing money with their when they with dogecoin they just printed a bunch of money and so they know that there's money there uh so they need to just lean into more crypto stuff and so that's what they're doing here yeah that's great i don't know 30 million users 40 million users like a lot of retail users using robinhood so another good onboarding also zora v3 this is an nft marketplace i feel like it's a bit more crypto native david and v3 is rolling out so what is coming on zora v3 yeah zora v3 i think is the most like bankless aligned uh marketplace nft marketplace that it exists it's very much aligned with the protocol sync thesis and if uh the word the phrase protocol sync thesis doesn't land with you go please go listen to the podcast and or read the article on bankless about it it's a fundamental bankless thesis uh and what um the protocol thing sees this is in a nutshell is it's a very it's a very deep protocol they're very zero trust assumptions very little trust assumptions uh things can be built on top of zora nft marketplaces can be built on top of zora v3 it's like a meta protocol uh and so not only is zora a marketplace in of itself but it's there's the zora marketplace and then there's the zora protocol and the zora marketplace is built by the zora team and so is the zoro protocol so they built their own marketplace on top of their own protocol but many many many marketplaces can be built on top of the zora protocol so it's kind of like 0x and matcha right like matcha is an application built by the xerox team that uses the 0x protocol but anybody can use the xerox protocol and so this is the same kind of uh idea with going on with zora just trying to scale out trustless nft marketplaces so they've released their zoro v3 article there will be a link in the show notes if you want to learn more uh and at some point we're going to be doing some content with jacob from zora about this uh because he's a deep thinker and this is a very like bankless ethos marketplace that we definitely need more of that in the world of nfts almost everything on jane with uh this this style of nft minting actually william piester from metaversal wrote a fantastic intro to zorav32 so you can go check that out at metaversal.banklesshq.com if you want more on that too let's talk about this dolla hq they're just launching full support for forming dow llc's in the us from anywhere in the world i just thought this was pretty cool david because you know wyoming passed that legislation uh about being able to like link dows to wyoming llc type entities and get bank accounts and now here is a a third party uh dalla who is making that easy so you can just kind of click and generate you have a dow and you can generate an llc entity for that dow and register it in wyoming get a tax id get bank accounts this is another form of interoperability another form of bridging this is a bridge from the the new world of crypto to the legacy legal world of of nation states and it's cool to see that get developed 100 100 um let's talk about this hack.xyz yeah so we discovered this after doing our curve episode uh last night that was last uh live streamed wednesday night fantastic episode by the way uh and pac.xyz is a way to vote on the quality of certain uh congress members uh certain representatives uh or potential representatives on how crypto aligned they are so this is your your are you a friend of crypto scorecard and it's public and everyone gets to vote as to whether they think somebody is crypto aligned or a crypto hater uh and it's just basically calling out all the crypto haters out there uh that are giving them a score giving them a score uh from negative five to positive five and so there's a number of uh you know crypto haters out there there's also mitch mcconnell comes up top elizabeth warren is a big crypto hater uh this changed from yesterday david so yesterday elizabeth warren was on the top yeah so somebody came in and really dumped some negative five votes on a lot of people yeah tom cotton john kennedy susan collins all got negative fives right and the community votes on these things right community votes yeah this is community generated um uh it's kind of like a uh yeah community generated list but we also have some winners on there so we have erica rose up top we have tom ener emmer coming on the podcast in a couple weeks pat toomey uh uh ted budd cynthia lummus um so if you are trying to figure out where your congressman stands or if you have an opinion about where your congress person stands about crypto you can check it out at pac.xyz um nice app nice website also that curve episode is awesome is awesome i learned so much here it felt like it felt like the finance mmorpg like things that i've predicted would come to crypto like years ago uh yeah curve wars are done totally this is the curve wars episode of bank let's go check that out too uh get let's get into the races this is very crazy all right here's the theme right just like a few months ago many of these companies were like already massively valued and now they're just raising at an even higher valuation i'll start with consensus so they just raised more it looks like they're they are raising they have not they are raising or amazing at a 7 billion valuation and just not less than two months ago they raised at a 3.5 billion dollar valuations these private markets are just cranking uh what's the next one david yeah we got fire blocks clocking in at eight billion dollars after raising five uh 550 million dollars they just raised they just raised last race during the summer remember this i think the last time we talked about a firebox race we were also saying how they had just raised uh yes so damn if you think 2.2 billion dollars i think over the summer time when we talked to fireblock ceo amazing amazing uh and it doesn't end there we also have block daemon which is a public blockchains infrastructure service like staking as a service node stuff uh raise 207 million dollars at three and a quarter billion dollar valuation um crazy it's like the oprah winfrey meme like you get to be a unicorn you get to be a unicorn just handing out these billion dollar evaluations everywhere yeah meanwhile while our crypto assets are taking a tumble the evaluations of some of these companies are just through the roof uh and coming in uh last but not least ftx us scores an eight billion dollar valuation after raising 400 million dollars um so this is just ftx's u.s subsidy okay fdx writ large is like already in the 20s of billions maybe 30s of billions by now but i have a take about this ryan uh what's your take dave my my take is some gargantuan raises happened last week and every single one of these investments is going to underperform eth and btc over time every single one so if you take if you as the listener are frustrated that you were not able to get into some of these rounds just buy bitcoin and ether because they're going to be the winners do you really think do you think that that's just like that can't be true in 10 years when um the price of ether is 20 trillion dollars as uh kathy wood and team predict right so like um it's got to be the case that some of the value capture happens higher in the stack as the market matures don't you think and are you just saying that like ethan bitcoin still have a ways to go before that point or do you always think that ethan bitcoin will outperform kind of app layer style investments i i think if we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars into billion dollar valuations uh then at that point like a lot of that upside has already happened and so these are these are like these are people trying to take like risk off investments which is weird because this risk off investments onto an uh industry that is living on top of these risk-on assets um so just take the risk like it's hidden risk because like they're trying like oh we're going to take the go the safe route and invest in equities rather than crypto assets but the equities are based on the crypto assets just buy the crypto assets yeah this has definitely been true historically uh david let's talk about uh another true thing historically that's getting a job in crypto is awesome it's and also bullish also for you yeah bullish for your life both for your career um go to the bankless job boards and see what jobs we have maybe 2022 is the year you get a job in crypto a few i will read out senior go rust engineer at syndica a smart contract tech lead at star x a senior full stack engineer at syndica a lead data analyst at maker dow a data engineer at paperchain a senior technical writer for go ethereum the ethereum foundation there's more to go check the bankless job boards bankless.palette.xyz to sign up check those out get them in your inbox as well uh you know this is an interesting tweet from from the block works folks it's a whole thread on all of these weird job titles and the corporations that are starting to hire for them nike is hiring a metaverse director who is nike sorry i said a metaverse director for nike and that's not the only one pretty uh they have a whole metaverse category uh it's a principal innovation engineer metaverse category uh senior 3d game designer metaverse engineer in at nike like crazy crazy metaverse engineer at nike that is uh well i bet they have like you need three years experience working in the metaverse or something like that probably but seriously nike come post the bakeless top board too yeah we'll get you a job we'll get you a true crypto native a true person who's actually been working in the metaverse i mean there are a few people maybe three years have you been three years in the metaverse sir oh five years my whole life ever since i got it he was born in the metaverse diablo ii was in the metaverse yeah that's when he started all right back in the early 90s when he you know started the they joined the internet with dc right mm-hmm um all right news time david oh boy are we ready to get into this here we go this is gonna be a mess let's do it what do we even talk about what are we gonna call this how do we even start this is like um would you call this a d5 scandal uh yes i think hubbub but it's scandals layered on top of scandals um so we're invoking an older scandal because we it's coming relevant again to talk about this defy scandal okay let's set the stage a little bit um we have to talk about um danny cesta golly danny sesta on twitter who is a d5 builder very talented d5 builder as well some people have compared him to like andre cronier he's like the andre cronier of you know 2022. andre of course you know built wi-fi tons of fantastic protocols in uh in 2020 and um like i guess that's some background on him he's got a guy behind the magic internet money wonderland time spell like all abercrombie whatever all the all this like my uh d5 mafia he's got quite a following today so like how would you describe like the tone and uh tenor of how danny operates on twitter and kind of messaging that sort of thing uh very very populist his his following is very aggressive of which i personally discovered uh you've been on the brunt and have been on the front end of this yeah very like working for the people anti-suits i work for you kind of big frog army leader uh he i think in his like twitter bio he's like like c-f-o-c-o-o something something of the fog army or something army yeah of the frog nation uh and so like very much like a 4chan populist type and the projects are interesting too because he has a tendency to like you know ship fast very fast forking things taking whatever got it gotta appease the frogs right yeah right so uh abracadabra and he's made a lot of people a lot of money yes i would say is some of the context like token price has gone up abracadabra.money is a make your fork actually that um take some of the the guardrails off of maker i would say makes it a little bit more risky a little bit more some people say interesting conservatism out of maker dow yeah yes and wonderland is a more recent project um time the time token is part of that it's kind of an olympus fork and that's on avalanche okay so that's danny that's who he is um we got a first revelation this week and this is um you know twitter confirmed so it's somewhat unconfirmed but you know it seems like it could be the case what was this first revelation david yeah so the in the bear market a lot of the quote unquote bear market especially in the last week uh a lot of the his projects are based on collateral and collateralization and when the value of collateral goes down bad things happen uh and so uh there's been a thread from jack nielwald that like i i don't follow his projects too closely and that's why i got the brunt of the frog army um but like we'll go ahead and read this thread uh time is the largest own fork by market cap olympus dow forked by market cap right if you're scroll down um uh and has been used as a playground by den uh danielle i think is is how danny uh vc's ambitions and more creative ideas it's offered uh five-figure apycis takers but now as a result of the price crashes trading at its below is treasury value abracadabra money which is the spell token is a lending platform that lets users take out positions against crypto collateral and yield generating positions this allows users to take out loans that pay themselves off these loans charge interest and get liquidated and fees go to the spell holders danny and other team members have also taken out loans against their wrapped memo one of the one of the tokens using spell meaning they can cash out without actually selling so using their tokens as collateral to borrow against so they don't actually sell their tokens but they can get the value out of them but if those positions get liquidated they have all the money and it's basically for selling like they didn't press the sell button but somebody did um and so people talked about how this strategy would be uh perhaps exposed or uh liquidated if the value of these collaterals went down too much so they borrow all the money that they can against it and if it goes down then everything gets liquidated and like that you have a cascading liquidation um so this strategy was talked about on twitter causing time to crash below the value of the assets in the treasury possibly uh triggering a liquidation event uh buybacks were supposed to be in place to keep the token price at the treasury value no matter what but this didn't happen and the devs were silent leading to accusations of a soft rug danny locked his twitter account during all this drama um but fired back with an admission that time buybacks were not working as expected and a plan to fix time and bolster spell uh came out simultaneously uh and and so that was kind of like the start of this whole thing and what is this idea of a soft rug that's an interesting term what do you think that means yeah that's just talking about how like he's not he's not like capitulating his own assets he's just putting his assets into a collateralized position borrowing as much money as possible on that and then if the value of those things go down and then there is a liquidation event like it doesn't matter because he bought he borrowed all the money anyways so it's like a roundabout way to exit without actually pressing the sell button i got it and that's the charge again somewhat unconfirmed and that was just the the first part of it if that alone happened we probably wouldn't be ha talking about it right now but something was added to that which is the second revelation and uh this is going to be this is unrelated actually so same person same projects but a completely different bit of drama going on okay so what is this this bit of drama um because it's yeah it's it is unrelated but it's kind of related to the entire you know scandal story actually before before we get into that it is tbd about whether uh danny would and uh some of the other big leaders of the of the projects were doing the soft drug that is an accusation uh they also could be using that same money to pump the to bolster the time price that is what i think danny has stated he was intending to do with that in order to prevent a cascading liquidation so like there this is not this still kind of unraveling uh and we're still kind of figuring figuring this out but in the meantime in the meantime uh there is a bunch of other drama that that came about uh so are we ready to go into this yeah let's go into this and there's some backstory here so i guess maybe the the high level is that a former quadriga co-founder uh just emerged and apparently he's been the right-hand man right-hand person of danny managing a lot of the money behind the time treasuries and on this individual yes on the multi-sig this individual michael uh patron has an incredibly shady past um how should we best explain this like who is michael patron what what is this shady pass what is quadriga do you want to tell some of the story here david yeah well michael's patron has been off the radar off the grid for a very long time but this individual zack xbtc xbt tweeted out private dms and telegram with danny and he says to danny i came across something rather odd about um about o.x sifu which is one of the multi-sig signers on the projects and and he goes i i've discovered something about sifu uh and danny goes what's up uh and xerox zac xbt says well he's the quadringa guy uh the the quadringa guy that was a convicted felon for uh identity fraud and and has been off the grid for a while uh and danny goes i cannot confirm but i have thought a lot about that and uh he responds dangerous to be working with him sir uh and that's one tweet and um uh then that's that's basically that uh and so he tweets out this needs to be shared xerox sifu is the co-founder of quadringa cx michael patron if you are unfamiliar with that it's the canadian exchange that collapsed in 2019 after founder gerald cotton disappeared with 169 million dollars i've confirmed with this about with danny over messages uh and so this is a really big deal uh because this is an individual with a very shady past uh and is discovered to be a multi-sig signer on this uh d5 protocol on avalanche that has a ton of tvl uh and so managing millions of dollars millions of dollars of people's minds of a protocol and like what's what's uh egregious about this is that danny knew about this for about a month without raising the alarm about the significance of this individual so there's this fantastic summarizing article that we're going to read some of the things about it just because it summarizes so well um after all this came out after uh 0xbt said revealed this danny if you want to scroll down a little bit ron danny posted on twitter today allegations about our team member xerox sifu will circulate i want everyone to know that i'm aware of this and have decided that the past of an individual does not determine their future i choose to value the time we spend together without knowing his past more than anything uh danny also issued an official statement reiterating his beliefs in the second chances and reassuring everyone that all the funds are safe even though a convicted felon is watching over the treasury i found out about this one month ago and i am of the opinion of giving second chances as i've mentioned on twitter i've seen the community very divided about my choice of maintaining him as the treasury manager after finding out who he was in his past he added that patreon patron uh will step down from his position at wonderland and there will be a vote as to whether or not he rejoins the team that vote is ongoing at the time of recording wonderland has uh has the say to who manages the treasury not me or the rest of the wonderland team says danny um yes also uh this is where this is of just again fun and backstory on this michael guy michael patrin is former convicted felon omar danani who legally changed his name to cover up his criminal past patron left quadringa in early 2016 after he and cotton allegedly had a quarrel in split ways prior to founding quadriga patron was one of 28 people arrested in connection to operating an identity theft ring called shadow crew he pulled guilty and was sentenced to 18 months in u.s federal prison upon his release he was sent back to canada where he went right back to doing the thing he was always doing all along which was moving money uh and so that's kind of the story uh the the take at the very bottom of this article has a take of on this individual he says uh patreon is a one-trick pony he's not clever enough to reinvent himself and his hubris makes it impossible for him to simply disappear and go quiet and enjoy a life somewhere kind of pointing out he's like a serial shenaniganizer okay all right so just i i wonder if like so just to follow this large d5 protocol managing lots of money with a very esteemed builder d5 builder in the community danny the community finds out that the person that danny set in charge of the multi-sigs and this community treasury is a convicted felon super shady individual various individuals yeah nefarious individual probably many in the community would say should not be trusted with money and furthermore that danny knew about this for a month didn't disclose this to the community and so and then uh it was interesting because danny decided to double down and say hey you know second chances i believe in giving people second chances before then going back to the community and say what do you want to do with this individual should he still be managing the the funds or not and so this created quite a um a stir on twitter i would say right you know back and forth people are disappointed with with danny but the kind of the lack of transparency disappointed with um you know the project and some of the statements um michael patron made a statement as well do you want to get into that or skip that david yeah it's more or less like hey i've had a fantastic time uh working on wonderland i'm sad that i'm going to have to go i understand why i have to go uh but i'm i'm leaving and i love all of you uh and then a bunch of emojis from the community in discord you can uh we'll put the tweet in the show notes yeah so here i guess some takes that i have early on first first of all we reached out to danny actually and he's going to come on the podcast i think hopefully next week and uh talk about this so give him a chance to kind of explain hopefully his actions i've given him my calendly link before and he hasn't clicked on it hopefully he comes on the pod fingers crossed and that's what he publicly committed to we are very fair and we are very fair and rational individuals so we can we can do this yes yes at least david is i'm not so much but um takeaways for for me like this is a very bad look for d5 this is kind of the the fodder that elizabeth warren wants to bring to a senator committee like if she found out about this right so like you've got a conflicted convicted felon managing millions of dollars of investors capital without them knowing about it oh what's her answer to that regulation more regulation in the space so you know one take from me is like sorry i'm sorry to cut you off this is a shadowy super coder yes that's who this is this is like this is like oh yeah i told you so and we'd have to be we'd have to say okay elizabeth in this specific case you're right uh and here's the take i guess if we don't regulate ourselves they'll regulate us yeah okay and i i think this is why um the original poster uh for this was it zach um xbt is doing god's work in surfacing this taking a big risk because he's taking a risk yeah because this through the frog army is not something that you want to mess with and this is good for threats david i'm sure he's gotten threatened people in his dm's i'm sure it's like you know even legal threats all sorts of things but an individual whistleblower shedding a light on this is more of what defy needs in order to keep itself going yes zach xbt nice job well done nice job thanks for having the courage to surface this um and i guess my last takeaway on this is just in general we have to be very careful of trusting people in d5 okay like trusting people in crypto in general or especially it's a red flag for me whenever someone asks you to trust them okay like the takeaway here is never trust anyone in crypto that demands that you trust them and people who are continuously saying no it's fine like i've got the multi-sigs just like just like trust me uh i have your best interest at heart that always sends red flags and shivers up my back because the whole philosophy is crypto of crypto is verify don't trust you shouldn't have to trust people we have systems in place to make this entire space trustless and um we don't want to depend on trusting a small set of individuals it's not reputational trust in this space it shouldn't be this is anyway those are some of my takeaways what do you have and on developers are always a hairy topic because like it's good overall but also i'm happy that people are able to be an in this industry if they so choose but also the combination of anons on multisigs is a little bit rough because reputation is a fantastic piece of collateral to have to hold someone accountable and if you are an anon like you remove the that option from the community to hold you accountable because of how you're in on this guy this guy uh michael literally changed his name yes right literally changed his name how much to cover up the past right to cover up the past how much easier is that to do on the internet where you could just you know change beneath the dress create a new you know online reputation and start from scratch uh yeah so it's something that we have to work on here are some takes from around the community this is andre cronier who works very very closely with danny yeah once you read this this is just the uh oh it's so tiresome meme it's also tiresome and andre says i just want to code uh and he has some commentary further down as well uh where he says i still support danny still planning on working hit with him but there are lines a history of consent consistent fraud theft and malicious behavior isn't a mistake that's intent having sifu manage funds especially user funds can be argued as negligence that's all i have danny knew for a month and in that time sifu was handling funds i don't know what psyops i don't know what's going on i want to get off willy wonka's magical ride there you go from from andre uh a similar kind of builder in the field uh what's the stake david yeah so danny danny wrote somewhere that he said like i thought i could fix him like oh i thought i could fix this this convicted felon person uh which is a brunt of some jokes on crypto twitter uh and then simona pop who's a fantastic uh female community leader in the space goes the female urge to know that that never works yeah i can't fix them and i think look i think the important thing here was uh transparency and disclosure right it's like if the community had known who this individual was managing their funds then they could have gotten ahead of this and voted on it and they're in the process of voting now and i expect they will not reinstate this individual as the manager of their millions of dollars in treasury we would show the snapshot but it's got the feature of it the votes are being hidden so we don't actually know like who's winning or who's losing uh this phone it'll probably it'll probably be available by the time you guys listen to this anyway it all ends january 28th at uh pacific time i think yeah there you go well that that's what's happening in d5 the kind of the latest thing um that was a good one that was a good one it took us a while to get through i hope you're hanging with us uh let's talk about some ethereum stuff um big moves this week so ryan wyatt he is a executive at youtube over their gaming division he's leaving youtube yeah he was he's leaving he's joining polygon studios okay he's joining a layer two uh development studio as their ceo and uh we've we've messaged him you privately he's basically said yep um burn in the ships all in web three here i come nice super cool to see that exodus i think you know it's going to be you know he's coming on the podcast too right damn it that's what i was going to say do you know what he's also joining ryan the front the banquez podcast yes uh we're excited about that too we're going to talk all about it um youtube also wants to help content creators capitalize on nfts that's the headline but uh apparently youtube execs aren't uh aren't satisfied by the rate of webtoon movement so just you know saying that you're gonna do nft stuff not enough to keep the talent on the ship yeah that's right but this is a cool message from the ceo of youtube who is stating that they are going to focus on expanding the youtube ecosystem to help creators capitalize on emerging technologies including things like nfts while continuing to strengthen and enhance the experience creators and fans have on youtube youtube adding nfts we'll see that this year at some point in time that's big david something happening in the solana ecosystem as well we don't have to time to get into all of it but uh what is the tldr summary here yeah so during all the liquidations during the big oof candles that happened last friday saturday and sunday solana uh did the whole go down thing again uh significantly again significantly degraded performance that basically prevented the average individual from pushing a transaction through the salon chain they couldn't even pay enough like with ethereum gas prices rise but in this case they could even pay enough to get their transactions just like wouldn't work yeah the network just wasn't accepting transactions except in like very specific scenarios and so on a network consensus is different from what i'm used to anatoly the ceo of solana goes a quick summary of the recent performance issues in the network liquidator bots started spamming the network with 2 million packets per second hitting a single node with mostly duplicate messages these messages unearthed the bug and how the network was handling duplicates the code responsible for for deduping messages was after the significant signature verification blah blah blah since then the network has seen much better performance but there's still some starvation happening with the liquidator spam under load blocks are smaller with fewer than expected transactions and here's the part that i'm i it's a really big red flag for me to to address the general issue engineers plan to introduce flow control in version 1.9 with q os by stake weight stake weight is like the stake of the solana token but now uh stands for quality of service ah thank you but now implementing this feature in 1.8 is the highest priority this implementation uses q-u-i-c do you know what that one is quick no okay to rate limit senders that should be rolled out in the next 45 weeks okay introduce flow control by stake weight in plain english which anatoly seems to be allergic to he is saying that transaction input transaction inclusion in the blockchain will be controlled by your level of salonist stake uh and so if you have significant stake you get to add your transactions in more consistently and this is the the thing that has always bugged me about solana because if you cannot validate the chain then you are at the whims of the people who can uh and it's and and so they are get in this case in this case they are giving validators with stake as a proportion of capital they're they are elevating them the validators with you know more capital have the ability to censor transactions have the ability to capture mev and get their transactions in ahead of the plebs so the significant stakers of the solana ecosystem the massive exchanges of the world that run the validators are able to get their transactions in first before the users so if you have a race condition to save your position from being liquidated you will be losing to somebody with a significant amount of stake which is always almost always a very well capitalized individual so your uh transaction as an individual to save your position is going to lose to somebody with a lot of capital who's going to liquidate you welcome to robin hood again welcome to robin hood why are we why did we get upset by gme in the first place like this is this is the traditional finance system where the bankers win like this is why this is why this the specific network design of solana does not sit well with me yeah i just don't think it's situated to be a layer one settlement you know layer with this kind of design i i think that you know some in solana might might see this as a feature oh okay we're we're you know improving we're making sure the network doesn't go down by implementing this this quality of service by stake weight feature but it is not a feature it is it's central it's a bug in the system it's like hey we found another way to introduce centralization there you go enough of that uh sorry i don't like being negative but [Laughter] it's concerning it's extremely concerning okay okay one one more thing about this ryan what happened in 2008 when the markets turned into a gigantic mess when markets and financial markets we had our episode with tarun chitra who talked about every single financial innovation is is about the process of removing lawyers what happened during the bottom of 2008 was that markets broke and because of the like collateralized debt obligations and all the mess of who owns what everything broke and so they had to reintroduce lawyers back into the system to determine who owns what if the solana blockchain goes down and halts and like the the clarity on who gets liquidated and how is broken and people's legal rights feel violated it goes from a world where we have consensus determined by a blockchain to back to lawyers and the goal is to never go back to lawyers and so we need networks that have 100 uptime because the difference between 100 uptime and 99 uptime is that all of the important stuff happens in that one percent and that one percent is when the lawyers get called in and that's where regulations happen and that's where elizabeth warren gets upset and then we do not want to piss off elizabeth warren no esp especially not i don't want her to find out about the danny thing to be honest i hope she's not listening to this podcast elizabeth uh yeah and i i hope people aren't hearing from that that like oh david hates solana bankless hates solana ryan hates solana it's like no we don't i mean i think salon is a fine execution layer i think it is is fine in doing what it's doing and onboarding lots of people what we are saying though is with things like this reveal that it is not suitable to be a layer one settlement layer for the world it's not suitable to be compared to what ethereum is doing and uh anyway enough said on that let's keep moving layer two 2022 it is the year of layer two let's go through a few things so uh synthetics just launched incentives token incentives optimism this is great tokens on top of tokens uh this is going to juice up the l2 ecosystem i hope more projects do this any other thoughts david yeah 50 000 snx will be distributed over a one month period to people that uh lp ether and snx on uh gelato network on top of optimism so cool congrats to optimism glasses and synthetics let's get these yo farms out the door guys yeah uh this is another cool thing that's going on a battle for fees in the battle for fees between all of the roll-ups users win because fees just go down uh arbitram just published an update that lowers transaction fees once again and their big transaction fee lower hasn't even been implemented yet that is called nitro and look at them all competing so arbitrarily screenshotting that and they're like haha we're lower than optimism now just last week they weren't they keep trading blow for blow it's like optimism is like well we pushed an update and now our figures are lower now arbitrary well we pushed an update now our fees are lower and i love it right and so this is optimism talking about your transactions going up savings going up as well get you a chain that can do both this is the kind of competition we need in this space right because you click on the graph click on the graph yeah yeah so so on the what's the the red line is the number of transactions per day which as soon as optimism did their update last week which reduced fees by 30 it just hockey sticks uh and then also what also hockey sticks is the black line which is the multiple times cheaper versus the ethereum l1 and so we went from like it's awesome to 50-ish 60 times cheaper to over 200 times cheaper with that last update and there are more updates to come when you make the blocks cheaper there's more demand that's what crazy graph is saying as well crazy uh it's great uh fuse has also just deployed on arbitrome as well that is uh from rory of course this is a pretty big deal too zk dao huge this was just approved zk dao is a dow specifically dedicated to the zk sync ecosystem that is of course zk roll ups from the folks at matter labs they now have 200 million dollars to play with they're going to deploy that to users to actually not users developers ecosystem participants in the zk roll up network and there's all sorts of ways you can reach out and get involved so these uh layer twos are well capitalized as well it looks like they're going to use the funds to grow their ecosystems 200 million dollars go for the development i'm bullish bullish that's great nft is the bullish nft still david yeah can we just burn through these brands and nfts everyone's coming aboard nfts okay do you want to start prod prada and adidas which has recently ventured into the metaverse even once again no one knows what that means are partnering to launch a collection of nfts later this month uh so oh also on polygon also on polygon gucci gucci taps into toy brand super plastic to drop ten super cute treats nfts in february i do not know some of these brands super super plastic but light bud light uh the worst beer ever but beer giant and hauser bush launches nft project for bud light um cool cool we don't know if it's the worst beer ever have you had all the beers i've had some bad bud lights they're all in the same category the light beer shenanigans hey this link won't load but uh paris hilton apparently she's giving away paris hilton the nft she's a brand in of itself he's giving those away on jimmy fallon yeah again yeah uh elite shows are becoming like nft propagation engines um what's this this is something different on the nft side so open c is doing a thing what are they doing yeah so openc support uh has uh tweeted out on twitter to address feedback we've received about our creator tools we've updated our collection storefront contract limits to only support a creation up to five collections and 50 items per collection so basically what that means is that if you are using openc to mint your nfts uh your nfc you only have five different collections at 50 a piece so you have maximum like 250 nfts before you have to like make a new account or something uh so like uh putting in like throttles on creators and minting nfts and i actually don't know why uh that's going on um some definitely some negative pushback from the creator community on this one huh that's interesting wow okay bitcoin news el salvador they just purchased more bitcoin buy the dip here 410. more bitcoins uh the nation now owns 1 500 bitcoins uh and also plans to issue a 1 billion 10-year bond this year so we have michael say your bitcoin bond right bitcoin bond yeah so we have uh micro sailor and strategy and now we have uh naib taleb or however i can remember his name and el salvador kelly he loves the other one yeah he hates bitcoin great writer though oh all this well the nf uh imf is saber rattling and urging el salvador to remove bitcoin as legal tender kind of threatening them basically being like hey you're going to be cut off from the imf from the global finance community um bye-bye credit debt facilities if you continue doing this uh imf not happy waving their finger at buchelli and el salvador for doing this granted taking leverage on bitcoin as a nation state is like well you maybe you shouldn't be giving any more credit in that case i wonder i wonder if bitcoin like you know five or ten x's in the next uh few years i wonder what the imf will say and then banks are like hey guys want to borrow some money yeah i wonder if this message will change at all um let's talk about this i guess this is regulatory related ish bank related ish hayden adams creator of uniswop tweets this out this week jpmorgan chase closed my bank accounts with no notice or explanation i'm sorry i'm laughing hidden this has happened to me okay bank of america i've gotten canceled by banks as well he says i know many individuals and companies who have been similarly targeted simply for working in the crypto industry yup thanks for making it personal this part's hilarious to me dude it's like hayden built uniswap before he was pissed off okay what's he gonna do now laser eyes hayden adams let's see it let's see it bad move uh chase jp morgan this is a a take from brian quintez uh what does he say here david he goes likely a shadow debanking of crypto by the federal reserve or the usocc office of the comptroller is that what that is uh bank examiner examiners with direction from the top so brian quintet's very highly informed individual says that this is direction from the top former cftc commissioner right yep and he says if the examiner told a bank that a certain customer is too risky and that bank ended that relationship the bank is contractually prevented from telling that customer why um so i think my take is that like they saw hayden adams as a their customer of their bank they probably saw his bank account go from like zero to plus one million dollars very very quickly and they were like we don't like this guy we we gotta rug pull this guy this guy's getting too busy yeah yeah this is a university he's a nerdy looking software developer with rainbow socks on like we could yeah what's he going to do about it we'll just like we'll just shut down his bank accounts right meanwhile all of his wealth is in crypto welcome to the bankless world hayden yeah welcome you're forced to go bankless first banklessness you know this is this is unfortunate right but this is going to happen more and more and what it's going to do long term is completely erode the institutional credibility of the banking system they can just exit hayden from the banks right and people see this people are smart they'll know they're figured out where oh how happens to the money in his account like do they just cut them in check or something no this is what they did for me they they're they're like uh they literally cut me a check they're like in 30 days we're gonna send you a check and they sent me a check by mail with the money i hold on your money for 30 days yeah they can't do they give you interest you can't log in oh yeah yeah 0.01 interest probably how do you know uh anyway mark zuckerberg okay zuckcoin is dead you remember libra remember how that was going to take over all of crypto that facebook was going to be the blockchain this is a narrative in 2018 people thought that this was going to kill ethereum everybody thinks everything is going to kill ethereum just like just stop saying that mark zuckerberg his ambitions route unravel around uh staplecoin diem sale talks so they're actually talking about selling dm itself whatever yeah i'm right majp morgan you guys could buy that should we should we buy it uh how much no of that i'll offer five thousand dollars so you get overpriced zuckerberg if you're listing five thousand dollars bankless will buy dm for you and we'll complete that project we'll just make it a stable coin on ethereum like it should have been okay next one new york city mayor eric adams receives first paycheck in the form of btc and e new york city

are back with the takes of the week this is the first one this is something you said in the market section sorry no it's it's it's worth repeating it's that good okay do you want to read the take yeah sure since i already said it earlier ryan sean adams says this isn't 2018. in 2018 crypto died on its own no macro to blame the market decided the substance didn't justify the hype today is different in 2022 crypto is crashing alongside all risk on assets fed policy caused this this is a macro shakeout this winter won't last two years that's that's great i think that's true i don't think it's gonna last i don't think that people are saying it's 2018 i don't think it is as soon as the s p reverses so does crypto and it will reverse even harder that's right yeah um so temporary maybe i don't know how long it lasts but i don't think it's going to be 2018 i don't think it's two years um this is something i ran across in the r slash anti-work um subreddit which was interesting and sad there was some drama by the way this week in the r slash anti-works subreddit it's 1.6 million um subscribers i believe to the subreddit uh and uh you know that that i guess is how to scope the podcast but i ran across this it's the headline people no longer believe working hard will lead to a better life survey shows i feel like that is very much why our slash anti-work got to 1.6 million subscribers it's because people are fed up they're tired they're jaded they're exhausted by their shitty corporate jobs or their shitty jobs in general okay and it's it's led to them feeling like working hard no longer pays and i i just i guess i guess i just had a thought on it first of all like i understand the sentiment completely but also it's not that working hard is the problem is it it's working hard in the wrong systems that's the problem the problems are all systemic yet again and i've seen so many people that work hard in the right systems so i would say in crypto like it's much more meritocratic at this stage so you work hard you hustle you connect with people you level up you learn on a weekly basis you spend time at this you meet people you develop some skills it will pay off it will lead to a better life like you will benefit and so i guess um i know if anyone from anti-work is is listening but i think that crypto actually holds some solution to the problem here uh people being jaded with their jobs and isn't it a shame that working hard doesn't lead to a better life now i think in crypto it can this is this is why we're on this journey as well oh i subscribe to anti-work crypto so i'm i'm hearing you ryan uh you hear me uh this okay reframed this is what chris burniske said when we had him on the podcast uh not the arc podcast but the one before that where he said uh the returns on capital will always out outpace the returns on labor as in the stock market is going to go up faster than your but your bi-weekly paycheck goes into your bank account the house price that you are looking at is going to go up faster than how fast you can work for your money and so that's why this headline is saying people no longer believe working hard will lead to a better life because all the assets are outstripped from their hands and you know why that's an iss why that's an issue is because the federal reserve prints a bunch of money it makes the cost of money easy to benefit all the people with assets and that's why ryan is saying that in crypto your work actually turns into actual capital because we have a new monetary system with new assets with new upside uh and so it's about the this when ryan says the systems i hear it's the assets uh so go and work around the assets that are new and novel and working for you rather than just like your wage slaves uh that you find in your typical nine-to-five job absolutely well said david all right let's go to the next one uh this is hayden adams again firing some tweets this week with a take uh the metaverse is having an account identity history digital assets etc that can be brought with you wherever you go that's what the metaverse is he says not a bunch of zuckerberg 3d avatars that hang out in virtual rooms together look at look at click on dc's responses just this metaverse guy thumbs up clearly out of like some facebook thing or something right yeah it's it's right though i mean we've said it before in our metaverse episode the metaverse is about property rights digital property rights that's what the metaverse is it's not like a weird 3d lobby that you hang out i'd rather have a 2d lobby and that's what zoom is yeah that's right uh by the way great episode on the metaverse earlier this week too if you guys want to you know tune into that we talk about some of these themes david let's end this take with this five reasons to be excited for the bear market you wrote this this is a posted market muddy and bankless i want to be excited about the bear market okay david tell me why should i be excited because this this post was so easy to write and it's these thoughts it was the thoughts i've been having ever since the bull market started it's like oh wait the bull the bear market was actually nice maybe it's talking about david's see here david's been craving the bear market that's why we're down okay so here's five reasons to be excited about the bear market one long-term wealth one of the most frustrating things about the bull market and when ether was like four thousand dollars plus is i would take my paycheck and i would go to gemini and then i would put in the number and the number of ether that i would get from that paycheck would be so goddamn small like well what the hell is the point anymore like i can't even move the needle so that was extremely frustrating uh and so now that ether is like less than half those prices like you your money actually translates into more more real money more more more more actual money uh so it's very just much more rewarding to be buying prices when they're lower uh and so like yeah you're like you actually get to move the needle on the size of your stack uh and so i'm looking forward to that again uh that's reason number one this is this is when people build generational wealth generational bear markets it's not it's not during the people in the bull markets are trying to get wealthy like inside of 12 months people in the bear market are trying to make their children's children wealthy that is the difference the secret of the bull market is you actually aren't making the money in the bull market you make money in the bear market as long as you stay for the bear market after the bull market okay also number two long-term relationships financial capital money is just one flavor of capital and this is not something that i realized i was doing during the bear market but it actually has been the most rewarding thing ever since which is building social capital social capital was one of the best things that i earned in the 2018 to 2020 bear market what is social capital that's your friends your homies your allies your business partners uh did you guys know that the way bankless started was that i got good at twitter i got good at writing i was in discord all the time and at some point i realized that there's this nice guy ryan out there and so i dm'd him and i said hi and that's how bankless started and i have so many friends that i made throughout the 2018-2020 bear market i'm going to people's weddings in countries and i was invited to people's weddings before i had ever met them in real life and that can be true for you too build friends in the bear mart in the bear market because you know that those people that are around in the bear market are the long-term people the long-term thinkers the people that you want to be around people that you can actually learn from uh so build social capital in the bear market just do it you could do it over the internet david and i have never met in person my mom still doesn't believe that what's next david yeah this this lends itself to the same one the amount of signal during a bear market is significantly higher than the amount of noise bull markets are noise dominated markets bear markets are signal dominated markets there are tons of projects that exist in bull markets that exist on just attention and attention alone not fundamentals and that is opposite of what's true in bear markets bear markets are only times that only uh uh projects with strong fundamentals can survive uh and so just the amount of alpha that you get comes to you and like it's it's kind of shocking like oh wait this is just straight pure alpha and like the reason why no one's taking advantage of this is because it's the bear market like all the the bull market tourists are gone and they're leaving all of the value on the table for me that's that's what should be your attitude should be next one up is building uh just long story short bank list started in the bear market uh it's easier to build in the bear market things are quieter you can put your heads down you can concentrate you can think more clearly there's not a new pumping dog token to to like pay attention to it's just easier to build in the bear market and as a founder you can find talent better because other people are also in there for the right reasons they actually care for the right reasons and then lastly also overall the net effect of all of these things is that crypto gets stronger crypto itself is anti-fragile what doesn't kill us makes us stronger and at this point in crypto's lifespan there's no way to kill it we've already won we have already won the game it's just a matter of time for waiting for the rest of the world to realize it uh and so think about what while you are going through this bear market which i don't think lasts all that long so you have six months to do all these things uh what friends will you make what will you help build what skills will you develop what reasons will you create to make you stay in crypto and so that is why i look forward to building throughout all this bear market with you if it is really a bear of which i'm not convinced well said though so david is bullish on the bear market that's the bottom line and he's i hopefully he's made you more bullish too uh david what are you excited about besides the bear market which you seem to be very excited about okay i have uh three things that i'm super excited about ryan uh one of them i was quoted in uh the washington post and i was actually just kind of like cracking up uh with the washington post some of the quotes i had that they decided to use i think goodbye to all non-believers says david hoffman bank list tweeted on sunday as prices continue to plummet listen to this we were all born in the bear market so finally we're back home david says noting ethereum is now worth two 2 400 and last time it was eighty dollars oh god i love this man it's a great article in the washington post and to summarize it up like i say obviously no one is happy to see their portfolio shrink 40 in seven days but it's a question of do you believe that crypto is the dominant financial platform of the future my man calling for conviction uh yeah that's what's convicted out there all right all right sorry next thing i'm excited about ryan is uh this link that i just sent you in zoom if you want to pull that up uh is i finally set up my gallery uh so you can check out all my nft displays uh and so uh i'm gonna wait for ryan to pull this up there we go boom gallery.so i recommend that you guys uh sign up for what is it it's a great way are these the crypto covenants these are the crypto covens of which i think are fantastic pure straight royalty uh there's also my crypto punk this is my nft pfp section there's my crypto punk my cool cat my couple of penguins and also the dow pumps out of bank lasalle but then also if you keep on scrolling down those are my one-of-ones from nate moulder who i'm super bullish on uh and these are just fantastic and then if you go down you have my metaverse uh plants uh i love plants of all types including metaverse plants uh and so i'm just excited that i got gallery up and running uh and then this is awesome how hard was that super easy it's super easy you just had to sign in with my my ethereum address and then the last thing i'm excited about is the layer zero that's coming out on tuesday of which i did an interview with the two founders of the boys club and the boys club is all about onboarding women into web 3. so that's what it sounds like and it's a really funny name and then they really lean into the humor behind it so if you are a lady who is looking to find other ladies to use ladies specific language and and just you know onboard people that you know of that are of your vibe into web3 boys club is for you check out the layer zero that's coming out on tuesday and if you are a dude who's trying to get your lady friend into crypto maybe send them to the boys club the boys club that's awesome man thank you for being with me through my three things ryan what are you excited about look i i'm excited to show you my gallery.so turtle collection pretty soon because i'm gonna fire this baby up i'm excited i'll be excited to see it ryan you know the real thing i was excited about was i'm i'm back to this uh blockscan.com chat okay because this was i think the first time where i actually used my etherdress as an identity like to log in and interact with somebody else who also had an etherdress and there's some fun use case this is a silly app but there are some fun use cases from this like you know support emails for something you know you ship an nft how do you verify that the person who's owning the nft is on the other side of a support message this could work for that also like um you know talking to hackers for instance but but also if like i see an nft in your gallery that uh i like maybe instead of going through openc i just like i message you on this i'm like david i want to buy some flowers hey hey dude like point two ethan yeah and i'm like no right two weeks i'm like i'll give you point two and two turtles and you're like yes no i'm like no this is cool this is cool and it just reminded me of like the aol instant messenger days and um really excited to see that uh it was just a lot of fun too a bunch of people reached out and said how much they you know love bank list all these messages um i can't wait for all the spam that's uh gonna be incoming in the future so i'm sure you know uh ether scan will add features and make it cooler over time but that was great new versions of uh nigerian prince messages well it's like look your ether dress is not just a bank account it's also your digital identity and i think this is one small application we did say i think 2022 is going to be a breakout year for some early use cases people don't anticipate on financial use cases of your private keys yup that's it all right maybe the week time let's get to it here we go what do we got lynn alden lynn alden with a meme that almost got 10 000 likes on twitter probably 10 000 like likes by this time tomorrow this is a simpsons meme of grandpa simpson talking to all the kids and grandpa simpson says back then the whole world would stop and listen to one guy say what he was going to do with the price of money this is what's happening this is why we're talking about a bear market is because everyone's talking about what is is the federal reserve going to make the money more expensive or is it going to make the money more cheap and everyone's super fearful that the old guys at the federal reserve are going to make the money more expensive and the thing i love about this the most is it just just strips the way the of the curtain is the emperor without the ropes this is ridiculous that we listen to these old old people behind closed doors talk to us about what the price of money is just let the money price itself is good at that yeah it's definitely what we do and the way they analyze your own pals every word and like gesture and you know intonation is uh it's painful as well it's insane that we do that it's insane i hope you're not still doing it several years from now guys stay tuned right after
