folks valentine's day is around the corner so we are talking today about red flags in your relationship specifically your relationship with nfts [Music] here are 13 things you need to look out for 13 red flags when investing in nfts number one indefensible mint prices this has been like a new thing lately where projects are charging more for their like initial mint some of that is fine some of that is very sus i'm gonna give you a little analogy here gary vaynerchuk launched a restaurant here in new york city that can only be accessed by token holders the base price to get into that restaurant and like be a member of this cool club was three eth in addition to the restaurant it's a sushi place and they are flying in sushi or i should say this they're flying in fish from japan for the restaurant so if you are looking at an nft that is like over an eath let's say maybe even three eth ask yourself is the value i'm getting from day one because we're talking mint price here is the value i'm getting from day one better or as good as fish flown from across the world in japan to new york city to go to a physical [ __ ] restaurant because if the answer is no you may want to wait a beat see what happens with the project if they're just promising the usual [ __ ] you might want to sit this one out number two sketchy social media activity the dms if a project is dm'ing you to like drive you to their mint and then already you should probably just run but if you then go to like one of their social media pages like their twitter page and nobody you follow is following that account again run or if like the number of followers they have is way too high given the amount of engagement they're getting on their posts like they've got 100 000 followers but then like two people like their post that's a red flag the kind of projects that are gonna dm you to go to their mint are also the kinds of projects that are gonna buy social media followers this is a sign to run number three artificial floor maintenance if you're hanging out in a project's discord new project hasn't minted just minted and the founders and the team are like obsessing over what the floor price is just like the people do you know people in discords are always like let's [ __ ] go to the moon like we're going to kill it right if the founders themselves are engaging in that and doing tactics hype up tactics and other tactics to buoy the floor price get the heck out of there that is sketchy that is not what you want to see you want to see founders that have a long-term orientation i interviewed poopy founder of doodles the dude has a gif that they start putting into the discord chat anytime they start talking about floor price just to distract people and get them away from talking about floor price serious legit projects that you want to be invested in are not going to have founding teams that are obsessed with the floor price on any given day abusive discord behavior if you're in a discord for a project and you're noticing that like the founding team the the official team is banning people for asking super reasonable questions like what's the road map i don't know it seems sus to me that you haven't said what your goal with this project is i don't know whatever and they're just like fud ban them that's suspicious yeah nobody likes unnecessary fud in a discord channel when everyone's trying to have a good time but like reasonable acceptable questions and the founding team is completely unwilling to engage with them or answer them and more than that they're going to ban you for them that's not cool get the heck out of that project feel happy that you were banned if you see somebody else get banned ban yourself by gtf owing next no audits i have to say like uh i'm a little guilty of this myself sometimes but if a project you're buying into hasn't undergone like a security firm audit to make sure that their smart contract is tight that's a project you might want to avoid now there are only so many audit firms and they're really backed up so sometimes a project will launch even without it but ask the questions this is again if like you're in a discord asking questions about auditing the smart contract and they're banning people for that bad sign know that the team cares about this and check when you can bad design and i mean this honestly in two senses bad smart contract design which can be a little hard to catch if you're a non-technical person which again see above that's why you want to get the audit but also bad ux ui design like if you land on the the home page for the project and like it's kind of sloppy or there's like a bunch of typos or like it just doesn't look good it doesn't feel good as a user bad sign get out if they didn't even put the time in to like properly design a website and like a landing page they are not going to design a good 5 10 year 15-year long-term nft project they probably can't even design a one-year nft project cause they couldn't design a damn web page like that's way easier connected to that last one is this other red flag which is low quality art depending on what the project's aims are this can go either way like if it's not an art project fundamentally if it's like a membership token a community token if the utility is clearly something that is where the real value for the project comes from okay maybe some low quality art isn't the end of the world but like for the most part most nfts these days it's about the art as much as it is anything else if the art is bad it's like having a bad web page it means the founders aren't serious about this project they aren't doing it for the long term they're just trying to get a quick buck get the heck out run from that project i can't even believe i'm having to say this next one this next red flag selling allow list spots this screams cash grab let me be clear allow lists originated as a way to let people who weren't already rich participate in popular drops so the problem was you had all these gas wars and so the prices would get really high even if the original price of the nft wasn't that high to mint it so the only people who'd be able to afford the project were whales the idea with an ll list was hey if you're in our discord early if you're a fan of ours but you maybe can't afford to go head-to-head with a whale on gas prices you can still mint something because you're on this allow list and that gives you a 24 hour or seven day window or some sort of window in which you can mint it if you're selling spots in your allow list that's undermining the entire point which is to let people who can't afford it get in that's a cash grab don't mint those projects number nine over promising if a project is telling you they are the next board ape yacht club do not mint that project do you know who doesn't have to tell you that they're the next board api club the next board api club like that is such a ridiculous the person the project the project that tells you they're the next board ape yacht club is being run by a couple of people who got into nfts like a week ago right they saw there was a lot of money sloshing around they were like we want a piece of that and they hopped on the bandwagon and we're like i don't know mordecai club seems to be doing real well we're gonna be the next ones like they know nothing about this space anybody who knows anything about this space doesn't launch a project telling you they're going to be the next board ape yacht club don't do it don't mint that project number ten a totally anonymous team is a red flag now i know i know that like as of four days ago or whatever the heck it is the board ape team you go labs was anonymous clearly there are exceptions in the sense that there are amazing projects doing amazing things that are very much not rugs that are being run by anonymous teams but what you need to do if you're looking at a project that is being run by an anonymous team you better hear them on twitter spaces you better see them engaging in a discord doing amas answering questions sharing the vision over and over and over again because they do not have the same level of skin in the game that a non-anonymous team has if you're not anonymous like you've got a reputation to maintain you can't afford to rug a bunch of people and run away because there might be costs to pay or at least there's a higher cost to pay and a higher price to pay than if you're anonymous and you can just like gtfo to your island somewhere with all the money that you just stole and nobody's ever gonna be the wiser so look into anonymous teams much more closely than you maybe would a non-anonymous team not anonymous team you'll check out the linkedin you're like this person's legit all right maybe that's enough anonymous teams can be a big big red flag number 11 lack of a track record among the team this one should be obvious if you're looking at teams which you better be doing you want to see somebody with a track record of success ideally if they have a track record of success in web 3 that's fantastic you know they know how the space works you know they know how to engage with the community you know the odds of their success in round two are going to be very high they also have more to lose if they already have a good reputation because they've done good work in the past the odds that they're going to want to do good work in the future so they don't lose that good reputation very high but experience in succeeding sort of in any realm is also really valuable if somebody's run a successful business again they have more skin in the game in life because they have a reputation they theoretically want to maintain it also just shows that somebody who can probably work hard who's smart who can work with others i don't have to spell this out too much like y'all get it if you've succeeded in another realm in life it's likely that you'll be you're more likely to succeed in the next realm in life i'm not saying that somebody without a track record can't do something great of course they can you've got 16 year olds 19 year olds dropping out of college all the time and doing amazing amazing things but again you're going to want to do a little bit more due diligence if that's the case number 12. this is our second last one guys you sad unverified on ether scan this is a red flag how do you know if a contract is verified or a project is verified you find the contract address for the project you type it in on ether scan you find the project in ether scan and where the little tab that says contract you look for that that little blue check mark just like you're on twitter you know little check mark says hey verified this contract's gonna work like it's supposed to doesn't mean there's not bugs doesn't mean it doesn't mean it's been audited doesn't mean there might not be problems but like if it's not verified on ether scan that's a red flag last but not least our final red flag poor ownership distribution if you're looking at a 10k pfp project and you check openc or you check the contract and you see that the distribution of ownership is across like a couple hundred individuals as opposed to like several thousand which is more common that's a risky ownership structure that means that you have a couple big whales probably the projects founding team or i don't know their friends who have a huge amount of influence over what happens in the project they could decide they need cash quick and liquidate real fast tanking the price of the project because they have so much power over it be really really wary of projects that have a ton of supply but very few holders usually not a good sign and you might want to wait a little bit until more holders hop in of course with all of these nothing's a guarantee nothing means that it will definitely be a terrible project nothing means that'll definitely be a success there's no shortcut in the world of nfts i know it seems like there's a lot of fast money roiling around here and there is but there are a lot of ways you can get hurt there are a lot of ways you can lose money and there are a lot of people not making crazy money in this space even if they're doing pretty well we just tend to hear about the wild success cases so this is all about how to get smart make sure you avoid the obvious red flags or when something's you know a semi-red flag because again a lot of these it's like maybe it's a red flag maybe it doesn't matter but you just need to do extra levels of due diligence if you're starting to see any of these particular features pop up in a project you're looking at also wait before you go i want to give a huge shout out to the
