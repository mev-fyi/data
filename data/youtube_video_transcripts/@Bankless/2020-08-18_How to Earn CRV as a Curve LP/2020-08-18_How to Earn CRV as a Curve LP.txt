[Music] hi everyone this is d5 dad and this is another bankless tutorial today i'm going to walk you through how to become a liquidity provider on curve and then ultimately earn the curve governance token i'm going to first walk you through how i think about where to lend my assets and then ultimately how that leads me to yearn.finance as a yield bouncer potentially but then how that ultimately leads me to the curve y pool and that's where we end up with what's properly labeled yield farming i'm earning multiple forms of yield as a lender a market maker and also as someone who's being rewarded with the curve governance token that was recently launched so this is a tutorial that is going to end up costing me a lot of gas in light of the gas prices on ethereum i'm probably going to spend about 75 dollars of gas by the time this is over or more so that means i need a position that is large enough to justify spending that to still earn a profit and so we'll end the tutorial with me actually staking my liquidity provider token that i receive for being a liquidity provider in a curved pool i'll show you how i'm staking that in the new curve dao and that's where i'm gonna actually stake the ylp token and i'm gonna earn the crv or curve governance token which is estimated to have an annualized percentage yield of 143 so i am needing a position that justifies me spending about 75 on gas in order to earn a return that is greater than 75 dollars in transaction fees and based on the size of my position i can then use this number to figure out how much of a profit am i actually expecting out of this also understanding that this number is going to change day to day with the fluctuations in the price of this new curve token curve is very new it's very illiquid there is not much supply of it so the price is in price discovery and this makes it really unpredictable at this point but i'm just going to use this number because we are a few days in and at this point the curve token that i earn to me is icing on the cake and so i just need to personally be able to overcome the cost of the gas that i'm going to spend so last week i used the dharma wallet it's a self-custody ethereum wallet to trade for free in terms of not paying gas fees with uniswap this week i'm going to show how i'm putting those assets to work earning lending interest to get started i'm going to combine a number of tutorials that i've done previously so i'll try to link in the show notes some of those recommended tutorials if you want to go deeper into the detail but for now let's just start with uh defy score so this is at app.defy score dot io and you'll notice that this is a place where i can compare what are the available lending rates according to the assets and the different defi lending platforms so i keep it really simple and i think about what are the assets that are in my wallet and one of the more obvious ones would be die when i have previously let's say deposited uh fiat into my dharma wallet that wallet uh converts it to die so now i've got digital dollars that are decentralized and backed by uh collateral that's stored in maker so long story short if i have die i can look here then to see what are the different available rates for that die and what i quickly notice is that the rates are very different across these platforms it's 8.59 percent on nuo it's 4.27 percent on dydx 3.3 on compound 1.27 percent on ave list goes on and these rates change daily you know these rates are changing actually more than just daily but if you check them daily you'll notice that tomorrow compound could be offering 10 percent because their pool is more utilized and there's more people borrowing that die and hence they're incentivizing me to lend my die so when i look at a platform like this it quickly signals to me that i'm probably going to struggle to pick what is the highest rate continuously day-to-day and i don't have the ability to move my die across these different lending platforms on a day-to-day basis because just the gas alone would end up destroying any hope of ever making a profit so the alternative to this is depending on which of these platforms i'm willing to have exposure to according to the defy score or according to maybe my my own experience having used these i then came to the conclusion that i would like to spread my die across these different pools i'd like to use a yield bouncing strategy now that i've decided that i want to spread my assets across different lending pools to maximize my lending interest for dye i'm going to go to yearn.finance yearn.finance is a protocol that's become much more popular but it's been around since january february this year and it's uh normally holding anywhere over like 500 million in total value locked and it also became very popular because they issued a governance token called wi-fi so with that information if i go to yearn.finance and i click on earn this is the utility that made your yearn.finance popular in the first place what i can do here is i can deposit any of these different tokens and i can maximize my interest rate lending them because what yearn is doing is it's moving my money to whichever of the pools has the highest rate and it's deploying a strategy to basically try to get my money into the pool where it's going to earn the most depending on the utilization rates of those pools depending on what money is moving in and out of those pools it's a lot of magic that happens under the hood and it saves me time and it saves me a lot of money to replicate what happens here i would spend so much money on gas and i would never actually make a profit so if we look at die here this is where i could choose to earn or deposit my die and if i choose to use this application they'll ask me to approve spending my die and then it'll actually deposit it so it'll be two transactions and then i'm effectively earning 4.28 and so anyways this is another route and this is different than me using these individual lending pulls this is more of a strategy to take my die and to push it to these different pools to maximize my lending interest because eight point five nine percent might be the lending rate today for nuo it could be much lower tomorrow and and so it matters over time that i'm able to average a higher lending interest rate on my die however if i know that i'm going to use die and i know that i'm willing to lend across multiple pools i have a third option is i could hop over to curve so that's curve dot phi and then i'm going to click on the y pool so once i get to curve dot phi slash iron i want to click on deposit this is where i can become a liquidity provider and i can deposit my die now what's special about the curve why pool is that i'm able to deposit my die or any of these other stable coins if i were to have those in my wallet and i'm becoming a liquidity provider and i'm earning a percentage of this fee so every time someone trades between these four stable coins they pay a fee of 0.04 and then depending on how much of the pool i own which currently this pool has almost 600 million in it if i were to own let's say you know one of one of one percent i would earn one of one of one percent of the 0.04 fee so the idea is that i'm earning these these trading fees as people are utilizing this valuable service to swap between stable coins however i'm also earning the lending interest because curve or i'm sorry the yearn.finance team that this protocol is actually powering what's happening in the background here these tokens are being lent across different pools and it's maximizing my ability to earn interest across all of the different pools we showed here earlier so let's just quickly review those puzzle pieces curve is a stable coin swap or a pool where i can trade between dye usdc tether and true usd and i would go to buy and sell if i wanted to do that but i am not i am someone who wants to earn the fees and i'm willing to put my stable coins into this pool and let people trade between them while those uh tokens are being lent the yearn.finance protocol is actually taking my stable coins and it's maximizing the lending interest by bouncing them between these different pools which are all different defy applications or liquidity pools so if i've made up my mind that i'm going to use the curve y pool to lend and become a market maker i also have the ability to earn this curve token and this is the new governance token from curve so now i'm earning three different forms of yield and this is technically why you would label this as yield farming i'm earning multiple forms of yield for lending liquidity and these are programs that are essentially stacked up on top of one another so instead of using the curve interface i'm going to choose to use zapper it's just a prettier easier dashboard for me to use to track all of my define transactions in the dashboard but to also use the invest tab where i have all of these different zaps that allow me to participate as a liquidity provider across protocols like curve synthetics yearn.finance balancer and uniswap so once i find the y curve pool i can click add liquidity and if i didn't have stable coins one of the really powerful things about curve is that i could actually just zap in some ether but in this case i'm going to deposit die which i already have so let's put in 300 die and then you can see i'll end up with 285 y curve tokens that is because these lp tokens are worth the trading fees plus the lending interest plus the original amount that i put in and so that's why i end up with less of these more valuable tokens i also want to choose my slippage tolerance for less liquid pools i would be willing to maybe take on two to three percent slippage but this is a much more liquid pool in d5 so i'm gonna mark it down to one percent otherwise zapper will let me know if there is a chance that there will be greater slippage than one percent and the last thing i do is choose my gas setting which i can figure out by going to the east gas station so the eth gas station tells me the recommended gas prices according to whether i want a transaction to go through in less than two minutes five minutes or 30 minutes this means that i need my gas price to be greater than 71. if it's greater than 71 way i'm pretty much assured that this transaction will go through if it's less and gas prices continue to go up i'll have to wait for the transaction to confirm at a later date when gas prices fall or i'll have to send a dummy transaction to unstick it the reason i use this in all my videos is because this helps me to save on transaction fees so if we go back to zapper you can see that these are uh recommended gas settings but i still get to choose through a meta mask in the end so if i choose 77 as the standard standard gas setting i can then click confirm now this is where i would give permission to spend my die so die is an erc20 token i have to give permission for zaprify to spend it to enable me to actually deposit into the y curve pool so i can click edit look at advanced and i see the gas prices at 77 way let's go back to the east gas station and let's hit refresh the reason i do this is that gas prices change you know constantly according to how much network demand there is i'm better off doing this and then setting the gas price and confirming it as soon as possible so that the gas prices don't rise on me before i set my gas price so i'm going to set it somewhere between these two i tend to put it above the 30 minute mark to make sure it goes through but below this just to save on on each transaction fees so i'll probably put it at about 75 way all right so i'll choose advanced mark it down to 75 so hit save and i click my full transaction details uh this is where i choose what permission i'm giving in terms of how much of my diet i'm willing to let zapper spend now if i choose unlimited it makes it really convenient when i come back to zap dye in the future into different uh zaps on zapify but it also is a risk because if somehow someone gains malicious control of those smart contracts they have unlimited permission to spend die in my wallet so i tend to go the more conservative route and put in exactly how much i'm going to spend and then i can just hit save all right so we're ready to confirm this first of two transactions and so now this is the second transaction this is where i actually zap in my money and this is why i was mentioning earlier that i think about the size of my position here in order to participate uh in curve i'm going to spend about 67 according to the gas price and even if i lower the gas price to 75 way i end up just saving a few dollars but given the size of my position i should be earning more profit to overcome the 65 gwain terms of gas fees this is just another reminder of why we need eth2 and why i always support git coin grants for eth2 teams like prismatic labs and sigma prime and many others so once this goes through i'll be a liquidity provider in the curve y pool and then i'll show how i'm staking my lp token to earn the curve governance token okay so i'm back and my transaction transaction's gone through so you can now see that i have a share of the pool which means that i have uh a share of dye usdc tether and true usd and it's split up according to the ratios in the pool and you can see that i've got about 313 dollars so if i want to hop over to where i can stake my curve lp token i want to click on dao and then i'll click on the minter and then this takes me to a page that's mentor slash gauges so this is where i can actually stake the token or the iou that was given to me for becoming a curve y pool lp so again it's curve because that's the protocol y refers to which stablecoin pool an lps liquidity provider so that's my lp token and if i scroll down a bit here is the y liquidity gauge a gauge is just a word that they're using to describe where i can stake my ylp token so there's a gauge for the binance usd pool there's a gauge for the compound liquidity pool and curve there's lots and lots of pulls and curve there's an susd curve pool there's a pax pool there's a ren pool there's an sbtc pool but i'm going to use the one that i just added money to which is the y liquidity pool and it's calculating about 136 apy according to the amount of crv curve governance token that i'm going to receive at whatever the the price of curve is today which is around five dollars so all i need to do then is just use this little slider to decide how much i'm going to stake the more that i stake the more uh curve crv token that i earn so i'm just going to stake all of my my ylp token here and we'll click deposit so the first thing i have to do is give permission for curve to spend my y die y u s d c y u s d t and y t u s d this is actually referring to the y here we go where did that go uh the y lp token so i'm going to give permission to spend that and i'm going to choose my gas price so i'm checking the eth gas station dot info and i'm going to make sure that the gas price is around 78 way and then i'm going to choose the permission here actually i'll keep it at this uh it's specifying exactly the amount of lp token that i'm going to spend so i don't have to worry about that unlimited spend and then i can hit confirm then the second transaction is where i actually stake or deposit my ylp token so you'll notice that uh the gas price is currently 80 gray if i check the eth gas station dot info i think this will go through if i put it down to 77 way and so that saved me just a little bit of gas i'm still paying quite a bit but relative to the prices last week this is not too bad so hit confirm all right i'm back a few minutes later and my transaction has gone through so now i am staked in the curve dao which means that i'm now earning this the crv or curve governance token and i can see that here under the y liquidity gauge that i have 298.33 uh y curve tokens that are staked and if i ever want to withdraw this i can just go here and again use the slider and i can withdraw that but what will show up here over the coming hours and days is i'll see my claimable curve so i'm earning crv and as it becomes available it'll let me claim it claiming it means that i'm basically withdrawing my reward that is the the curve uh governance token now because of high gas prices i'm probably going to wait to do this until i have like a more sizable amount of curve that's worth withdrawing and paying gas for but that's how it works and that's how easy it is for me to withdraw that whenever i want another thing worth noting is that if i'm in multiple curve pools so let's pretend that i have liquidity in the curve uh sbtc pool i would then have multiple poles earning curve and i can claim all of that curve across multiple poles by using this button and then lastly up above you can see a chart that shows me where all of my liquidity is so if i had liquidity in the sbtc pool it would show this as a pie chart showing what's in the y pool versus the sptc pool here's a quick recap of all the risks that i'm accepting in using the curve pool to become a liquidity provider and then ultimately earn the curve governance token so first by being in the y pool i am using urine.finance and it's moving my money across these different pools uh that are different defy applications and have their own smart contracts so that comes with its own risk each one of these applications has its own smart contract risk and so i'm essentially stacking that risk by moving my tokens across these different pools so if we go to yearn you can see here that yearn is moving my money across compound dydx ave and that's it actually it used to move it into fulcrum by bzx and ddex it's no longer moving it into those pools there's a chance that it could be moving money into more pools in the future so i've got exposure to compound dydx and ave smart contracts and then there's exposure to the curve smart contracts so just by using the curve y pool that's additional smart contract risk to consider it is worth noting curve smart contracts were audited by trail of bits so you can check out the audit there and then lastly i used zapper earlier so by using zapper that's another avenue to go down in terms of smart contract risk they do shuttle me from you know my money to having it into this liquidity pool so once i'm in curve i'm no longer exposed to zapper but initially when i zap my money into the curved pool i am again putting my funds at risk in terms of any sort of smart contract failure that could happen on the zaprify side the next consideration is just that i'm using a newer application built on curve so these liquidity gauges are part of the dow.curve.phi and so this is all rather new and just i consider the fact that there could be a bug in these smart contracts and the longer this exists uh the better you know the more tested it is and the safer i will feel with my funds in curve next up is the risk of just a liquidity crunch if everyone were to withdraw their die from this pool or if someone were to do a very large swap and to drain the pool of dye if i was wanting or expecting or needing that dye i now have a share of a pool that doesn't have that dye in it despite the incentivization mechanisms behind curves liquidity pool the next risk to consider is just using a stable coin so i've got exposure to all four of these stable coins uh a stable coin peg could fail uh and if that were to fail that would not be good for the liquidity that i'm holding so that's all i've got for you today i hope you find this helpful if you have any questions feel free to reach out to us in the bankless discord also you can comment on this youtube video or on any of our tweets and we'll do our best to answer your questions thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music] you
