all right i'm going to show you how to become a uniswap lp in argent in under 30 seconds so click the invest button scroll down to uniswap v2 liquidity choose whatever pool you want to become a market maker in then click the buy investment button and then put in however much ether you want i'm going to put in about 25 dollars worth and click the invest button and that's it so it's going to split my ether in this case into 50 die 50 ether which then allows me to be a market maker and earn fees whenever someone trades between dye and ether in uniswap v2 and then argent subsidizes all the gas so you can see my transaction still in progress but it should settle in a few minutes so after the transaction settles you'll see it in the finances tab here at the bottom the die eath pool and that's a uni v2 token so that's it and i hope you find this helpful you
