it's gamestop season the gamestop wallet is here it looks like a metamask extension it's a layer 2 wallet and ryan has got it built into his browser already i mean if you know what metamask is you kind of are going to be familiar with it but it's built on the loop ring layer 2. but the bigger question is what you can connect this to in the world of gamestop and so there are gamestop nfts at beta.nft.gamestop.com going from a brick and mortar business to a web three nft store i can't believe it the meme became reality and they're actually getting into crypto in a meaningful way i mean this is like a meta mask level it looks good wallet it looks fantastic there's a place for your coins there's a place for your nfts there's a place to swap in fact the user interface in some ways is kind of nicer completely self-custodial and these guys are on it i'm blown away with what they delivered in this first release so it's super cool to see
