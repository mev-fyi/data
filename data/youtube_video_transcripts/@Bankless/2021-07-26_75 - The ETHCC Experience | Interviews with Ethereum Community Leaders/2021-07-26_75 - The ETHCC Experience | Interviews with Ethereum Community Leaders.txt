[Music] welcome to bagless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan john adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david standard opener to every bankless episode but this is not a standard bankless episode you are in france right now as we're recording this intro and you just attended ecc dude we all have fomo all right like i wanted to be there i saw some of the clips coming out of this event a ton of excitement and you have promised the antidote to our fomo so what are we going to dive into during this podcast yeah so the format for this podcast is uh going to be extremely different uh ryan you actually won't be in the podcast because you're not at youth cc yeah sure yeah but this is for those that uh we're not at cc this is the podcast for you uh so these are about roughly 12 to 15 minute clips of just quick interviews with some of the big names that we all know and love many previous uh bankless podcast guests uh and so i asked a lot of the the familiar names just what their ecc experience is like and also kind of what the the state of crypto is for them uh and so i talked to vitalik staney kane uh and aya mayaguchi and and so many different people from around the ecosystem and uh kind of uh ask them what what is what it's been like for you uh the guest the the ecc attendee what the what the experience is like what uh what uh talks are they looking forward to uh what are they up to in paris uh what after parties are they going to so if you weren't able to attend ecc at least you have this podcast that's awesome man i'm super excited to listen to it so i haven't heard any of this uh full disclosure to you to podcast listeners as we're recording this intro but but i can't wait to listen to it and i've got a ton of questions but maybe the first is this for for people not familiar with ecc what is the etc event and david is this the first real like ethereum uh physical gathering place event since since kovid went down was there like an ecc event like just prior to covid as well am i recalling that correctly yeah that's right ecc number three was uh the la basically the last event before everything shut down and unfortunately people who went to the last ecc actually contracted covert there and that's that's where people realized a lot of the crypto communities like oh this covet is an actual thing that was like february march of like 2020 yes yes i think march of 2020 and they try and have ecc at every single uh the same time every single year um but they delayed this one to be a little bit further into the summer just because they needed you know more time to pass for kobe to be a thing so everyone's still wearing masks uh in in europe the the vaccination the rate of vaccinations in europe's not as fast as it is in america so masks at least in america on the west coast like masks are kind of done um but in in france and paris masks are very much still a thing um and actually today which is today's the actual second day of ecc tomorrow is the third of three days um uh today is a more more restrictive uh you know rules across all of france uh and so yesterday you could have gotten into ecc without a vaccination card but today you actually had to go and show your vaccination card or a negative test to get into the event uh so yeah so you came prepared with all of that like you knew all of that going in that this would be necessary yes well i also needed to bring my vaccination card to even get into the country uh they wouldn't have let me into france without my vaccination card so that that's a battle that that everyone's been battling some people uh who went to the the event depending on where they coming from uh had to fight even harder battles uh kane left australia kane warwick from very locked down in australia yes and so he had to like more or less like a petition his government to like hey please let me leave and yeah and and like say like this this me leaving is going to be economically beneficial to australia that's why you should let me go uh and and so he he's here in france and then he also said that he's also not going to go home right afterwards he's just going to do a little bit a tour abroad yeah mario and oconti who i've been hanging out with all week is in that same in that same boat um so he actually literally cannot go home because they won't let him back into the into argentina um and so everyone's coming from all over the world and everyone has like kind of their own game that they're playing with regards to kovid and what is what it took to get here and what it's going to take to get back home some people just don't have plans to go home they're just going to keep on touring around the world i can understand why so is this is ecc really an ethereum centric conference i think so right because eth in the name eats cc but also uh seems to be more more broadly defy so what's the overall tone of the thing is it more technology is it more applications like defy or is it more like you know base layer ethereum stuff or is it all of the above yeah it's it's specific to builders and so all the panelists actually there's actually not very many panelists i actually don't think there was a single panel it's all one one speaker giving one talk at a time uh and you had to apply to be a speaker but the the you know common denominator for all the speakers is that they are a builder and the what's unique about uh this particular eats tc event um and i haven't been to any other ecc event so i'm just kind of going by word of mouth here is that you know what the definition for builder is has really expanded in this particular ecc event um last tc and each cc is a really hard thing to say just say cc yeah um the the last ec event um you know there wasn't really this nft mania or blossoming ecosystem and there's there was a lot less like non-defy you know platforms right and so this particular ecc there's a lot more surface area for builders to be builders and so now we are when we say builders we're not just talking about um just people who can code but we're talking about people who are content creators like cooper turley uh we uh i interviewed cooper truly and he's big in the creator economy and so i got his take about what it's like to be at ecc and he gave his own talk and he doesn't code he's he's part of the creator world and he's going to be in this episode too he's in this episode yeah how many people did you get in this episode dude uh nine wow should i list them off uh you can if you can remember them yeah so of course i got vitalik uh i've had 15 minutes with italic first bankless podcast with vitalik in real life so that was pretty cool like i said cooper turley uh also jerome the guy who actually organized and organized ecc number four and also ecc numbers one two three so every single one that was a really interesting perspective uh kane warwick stani from ave aya miyaguchi um from the east foundation who speaks really really softly so i really had to bump up her audio uh simona pop and then also jordy from from hermes network uh and then uh also oh and um uh joseph de long from sushi and sushi had a really big announcement here at ecc's uh so those are those are all the people that i interviewed and those who are the people that you are all going to hear from okay so aggregate this for us david like what's the overall uh feeling or or vibe i guess the last cc event was pre-coded but it was also pre-bull run remember like march uh 2020 eth and bitcoin were just starting a like minor ascent but of course i don't know we were still in the 200s 300s right and then kobet totally smashed all of that um now here we are i guess we've had sort of a bull run but we're in uh crab market doldrums eat price below 2k as we're recording this but what was the overall feeling or vibe that you felt from this conference yeah yeah yesterday eth really dipped below to a new low at 17.50 and then today it's kind of risen up to 1900 and the only reason why i'm talking about press right now is that i have not had one price conversation wow no one is talking about price no one cares right no one cares no one cares and like granted it's largely because we've still had like a big run-up uh you know it's still very much higher than where we were a year ago like you've said um but this has not been a price uh conversation uh at all um that's including at the conference and at the like peripheral events that i've been going to as well prices not not a topic of conversation not in the slightest so what is the vibe what is the topic of conversation well there's so many different tracks um and so there's like the nft track there's a defy track there's the the non-financial uk use cases of ethereum track um the vibe i think i would say well there's a ton of energy first off everyone is really stoked to be there uh and everyone's just really chatty there's there's uh like many different rooms uh for all the different like conference or panels and and workshops and talks and so people are going to the talks that they are like really intrinsically interested in as in like th this is my like thing that i care about so i'm going to go to this talk but other than that people are out in the halls they're they're chatting with other people there's booths kind of spread around um and there's a big like congregation room uh and so people are more just hanging out in in the in the overall community and then and then also like an outside area with a nice big tree with a lot of shade so people are sitting under the tree people are talking as you would expect and and and the the energy is absolutely fantastic i would i would say the overall ambiance is that like i said this is like a builder-focused um event where builder is now kind of more expansively not just not just coders but just people who create uh and people i feel like we all know that there's still so much work to be done like everyone has like their builder hat on uh and everyone is talking about like so many brand new projects that i have never heard of uh are are at this event and you know people are wearing t-shirts serena like you know repping their their project or their company and a lot of new projects and companies that i've never seen before um so i would say that the vibe is definitely like we're all here to build and talk about building and also talk about like all the new directions that ethereum has taken in the last year since the last cc event uh and and we all want to kind of pow out and you know communicate what we're all up to because we're all builders here yeah i mean it it it seems like since the last conference in person there have been so many catalyzing events like you know nfts really came out and and were a big thing david there was a raise this week of open c the first nft unicorn like 1.5 billion billion with a b absolutely insane success there and now the ethereum community has layer two actually humming so optimism and uniswap uh just went live with the first layer two solution of a flagship d5 application on a rollup i should say not the layer two solution generally but on a roll-up super exciting so roll-ups are here we also have eip-1559 we have eth2 that's shipped with staking for over six months that's gone very well a lot of positive catalysts ahead was that some of the enthusiasm that was felt i guess that's why the conversation was so varied it wasn't you know we're trying to solve this one particular problems because a lot of the problems are being solved uh and like the ethereum community has sort of spread out in so many different directions there's so many different avenues that are being pursued mutually at the same time um was the feeling was there a feeling of kind of enthusiasm about all of this progress or what were some of the main i guess topics of conversation when you're having those conversations with people i i would actually say uh ether as a topic of conversation including like eip159 in the merge that also has kind of in the same way prices have hasn't been a topic of conversation ether really hasn't been a topic of conversation either um uh and there there's definitely a layer two track so there's a lot of layer two uh talks as as well but also people i think were really a lot of the builders in this space have kind of considered l2 as like you know we've checked that box actually with that like that's done now yeah like how about scalability more broadly yeah scalability yes overall and so here's yeah here's where i was going is uh scala like l2's optimism and like hermes network is here with zk roll ups and hermes network is about to implement their their own version of the evm on hermes network so we got smart contracts on zk roll ups not just on optimistic roll ups and and so well those are definitely topics of conversations because everyone's really excited about this brand new thing that we have about uh i have on ethereum people are looking towards different directions now uh so like privacy is a big conversation and other applications of zero knowledge uh zero knowledge rollouts i thought there was a booth with the um the dark forest game which is a game based off of zero knowledge cryptography uh and and so people are and so gaming is actually a really big topic of conversation as well and so uh definitely a lot of talk about l2 but now people are starting to look beyond the horizons because now now l2 is right in front of us and so there's a lot of conversations about you know what's next what's after we have scalability because largely scalability is a solved problem we just kind of need the things to roll out that's incredible how about youth 2.0 any conversation about the merge where what's going to happen in the future of sort of the the base layer protocol um again like not and not a lot of talk about proof of stake in the merge it's it was really an application layer conference i would say not an ethereum protocol conference and so it's it's really doing projects that are trying to like you know market themselves and also like teach the rest of the community what they're up to and what they're doing um not not a whole lot of protocol level stuff except for except for like cryptography there's definitely a cryptography element as well i know um you went to uh bitcoin miami just a few months prior so contrast bitcoin miami oh my gosh cc what like i and i i get that there are different conferences like ecc is more you know tied to builders but they are both i guess uh conferences run by their respective communities what are some of the contrast points or similarities oh my gosh there's so much there's so much um and granted i only went to the bitcoin conference for about a couple hours before i left and started doing like some of the ethereum peripheral stuff um but first off each tc the tickets for ecc were 300 and one of the um one of the ethos of the event when i was talking to uh jerome who organizes ecc is it it wants to be accessible and and you know viable for a broad community of people to attend it you know we we in ethereum like to lower barriers and but also in ethereum we understand that there are economic costs of things like the economic cost of etc was roughly 400 000 uh and so that got funded by you know 300 tickets or also sponsoring the events uh so that's kind of how they they made that and start contrast to like the 1000 or 2000 depending on when you bought your bitcoin miami tickets it cost you minimum 1 000 and up to two thousand dollars if you bought them i think within a month of the event uh and so bitcoin uh 2021 was definitely like profit maximization and each cc is definitely like okay we paid the bills right like uh and so that that is a stark contrast as well um also with bitcoin 2021 there were i think like three basically main main stages that that people were talking on but with ecc there's one main stage but i think there's like eight or nine like peripheral rooms going on uh and so if you you actually might have been caught in a rock and a hard place between going to two talks that were happening at the same time and if you wanted to attend both you had to pick one uh because there were so many things were happening in parallel uh and you know that was also true at bitcoin 2021 but there was again there's only three stages and three stages with like like thousands of chairs in each one whereas like each cc is like you know eight to nine smaller rooms some of them have like you know only 50 chairs to maybe a couple hundred shares and then the main event had maybe a thousand shares um also there were only 500 tickets sold so you know uh you know covet had to bring down the total number of people at the event um wasn't too crowded also bitcoin 2021 definitely over subscribed way too many people were going there uh and it was also in miami which was you know they in miami never people never put masks on in the first place and france and europe you know much more like conscious about covert and careful about cover than i would say um you know i would say about miami and bitcoiners at large uh and so you know masks on inside of the buildings no matter what and uh even some of the workers there would like have to say like hey like can you put your mask back on please um and so that's that was a little bit of of the vibe there um a bit more price talk i assume and way more price talk at bitcoin yeah at bitcoin yeah uh-huh even though even at bitcoin 2021 like the prices had definitely started to dip by then um and more panels at bitcoin 2021 as well and overall like bitcoin 2021 not a builder's conference because what are you building on bitcoin right like people are talking about research and development with like core fundamental like functioning of the ethereum blockchain right whereas bitcoin 2021 like i like i say bitcoin is not a place for builders therefore the builders have migrated into the social layer so bitcoin is building on the social layer and that's why that's where you saw like toxic mask maximalism as a conference topic for bitcoin 2021. uh you did not as you could guess you did not see that it's like celebrities right like floyd mayweather right right seeping bitcoin into the the wider mainstream culture or the big news coming out of that was el salvador adoption right so it's like not actually building it's like we already have this thing called bitcoin it's kind of finished yeah we're doing lightning a few other things but now it's about seeping this into mainstream acceptance and adoption it's got to have a completely different vibe than uh ethereum and its life cycle totally the biggest celebrity there at ecc was vitalik right yeah he he's the only one that had a little bit of a little bit of a posse uh every and then and then you kind of had the others you know just have a posse uh well there was also we'll get to this topic but there was also a documentary being filmed at ecc and so there were there was some people with you know decent production uh cameras like following vitalik around kind of getting some b-roll of him just you know chit-chatting with with the you know conference goers and so like there was a little bit of like you know posse there um and then the other celebrity aspect was just the other builders like everyone knows mariano conte he's like he pretty tall so he stands out and he he's also public and you know he he writes really good smart contracts and writes them for a lot of different communities and so everyone knows and loves mariano and so you know having him around like everyone giving him high fives and then you know he had you had kane and stani and and so those were our celebrities they were like the d5 builders uh and and so like i know did anyone know david hoffman and venkless the shirt really helped you know that shirt helped me stand out uh but no everyone it was hard to like walk more than just like a couple hundred feet without someone saying like hey man i love bankless i love what you guys do and i'm decently like introverted uh actually why podcast actually works well i find that hard to believe i know we've never met in person david hoffman but like i find it hard to believe that you're introvert but i know you've told me that you claim that right yeah so like coming to a an event where people already kind of like know me because i'm a youtuber like people know my face it actually is really helpful it's like i don't actually have to like explain go introduce yourself i don't have to wear the nape hello my name is david namesack yeah i mean i still introduce myself because i don't want to like assume and be like overly cocky but like yeah it's really helpful just like oh yeah like you've listened to bankless like you know we i don't have to talk too much about that well it's funny because i'm sure if they've listened to bank list they probably listened you and i ramble for like hours right so right they feel like they kind of already know david hoffman right so that's an advantage when you're attending a conference i suppose well tell me more about this uh this documentary so is this the documentary that was recently funded on the mere protocol made like two million dollars in funding community funding and it's going to be an ethereum specific documentary what's the scoop here yeah so the title is ethereum the infinite garden which is a fantastic name uh and then really the word infinite talks about iterative games uh and versus uh and this is a game theory uh reference where you have um one-off games where you just play one match or you have games that are recursive and you have they're iterative you play match after match after match and in one-off games you are in competition with your opponent but with iterative games you need to work with your opponent to come together so you guys can survive in the long term that's like the that's the and so that's the reference of the infinite garden uh a garden of growth uh new things being born out of this iteration cooperation garden of cooperation that's great that's great yeah it's a great great uh reference so i love the title uh and so um i i met with the the producers there and and so they actually filmed me interviewing uh some of the some of the key defy members right and vitalik included right and so i had my like dinky little like macbook laptop like recording like kind of hacky like recording on zoom and so i was just the only person in my one zoom room and the the zoom was recording me talking to vitalik with my microphone and then we had like this big big camera like walking around us while they were well they were recording us and so if you guys are listening on the podcast you can go to the youtube video and check that out um and so they recorded me talking to vitalik they also recorded me talking to jerome the the coordinator of of ecc and then also aya mayaguchi of the of the ef uh and so there are some bankless content being recorded being recorded by the the uh the actual documentary and ryan uh when i when i met the director she said like oh yeah uh you we want to talk to you and ryan and so i haven't had that conversation yet but uh apparently they they wanna and they wanna talk to us with like cameras and stuff i would assume i could only i guess it's a documentary yeah that's crazy man so if they do want to film us ryan here's what i think we should do i think they should film a meeting in person for the first time the first meeting in person just for the documentary wow just for the documentary you know what that would actually uh make it pretty epic and definitely a good story we should we should do that if they want to documentary people are listening when does this documentary come out i mean they're still filming it right so i don't know much of the agenda or itinerary i would imagine just like ethereum it would change as needed yeah so they're kind of just they're trying to fill they're just making content right now filming content and then they'll actually like edit it and turn it into something but i would expect not definitely not this year uh maybe if we're lucky in 2022 i think um but i don't know what it's like to produce a movie i only produce youtube videos that's right on zoom you know simple recording equipment uh that goes behind the scenes i guess they'll get a taste if they if they watch the youtube or if they watch the documentary as to behind the scenes of of how a bankless interview works um david what else do you want to tell us about each cc is there anything else yeah so uh today like i said is day two of three days of each cc i'm here until sunday this is actually my first time in europe kind of a europe noob um but tonight is french absolutely terrible so i i know a half decent amount of spanish enough to get by and so when i came to france in france i i came to france i was like okay i can't speak english they don't speak english here what other languages do i know i'll also start speaking spanish like no no no that also doesn't work no there's there's a decent amount of english speakers here where i've been able to get by i actually haven't been able to do too many france things um just because i've been all ethereum focused but after tomorrow i think i might just like straight up turn off like crypto mode and go straight into like french you totally should don't check any prices don't worry about i got everything covered on the bankless stuff just go enjoy paris my friend but the event that everyone is talking about is tonight which is rave uh and i talked to stan it's tonya about this yeah so ave is throwing a rave and they're calling it robin wow yeah and so uh i talked to sonia about that because i also talked to stani about um ave pro which has now been rebranded to ave arc to something something different fun fact uh and so this is their institutional ave exactly edition right something that compound did recently mm-hmm but but it's cool that ave is also throwing a rave or rob a uh but they're also throwing or generating like an institutional level uh defy app and so obvi obvious got ave the app for the retails you know the apes like you and me and then it's also got ave arc for institutions and now it's got rave the rave for the party scene right and i would imagine that like this is not going to be the last time that ave throws a a dope party uh and so they're doing it all man and so that i asked johnny that question is like avi's just growing tentacles into like all different spheres of ethereum and and stanis right on board with us man about like yo this isn't just like financial applications this is like community and culture uh and and one of the the big takeaways i had from my conversation from stanis he talked about how with there's so much new surface area in ethereum lately and there's so many new tracks to talk about at ecc we are no longer talking about like just coding or now just finance but also nfts and culture and more broader applications and so he's calling like all the attendees of ecc a society not just like a society a society that's fascinating or maybe a nation is in a nation for this what's so interesting about this david is do you remember there was a time where we could like count the number of defy applications projects on our hand right we knew all the founders we knew everyone every time every year that goes by it feels like we have less and less there's just too so much more to keep track of and now it's like it's even it's impossible to keep track of everything in d5 plus nfts you know plus like layer two plus all of these other areas that like identity ethereum is investing at the same time it's almost like the internet right like the very early days of the internet there were just like a few websites you kind of knew the main ones now go try to keep track of everything that's happening on the internet in parallel that's what is happening with ethereum it is becoming a digital society of of crypto natives super cool to see that man absolutely i don't have anything else to add ryan i think we should just go right into the interviews that's great let's do it guys we are going to cut right into these exciting interviews i can't wait to hear them myself but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrom is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing v5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrary comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrome so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrarum and join their discord all right everyone i'm here with none other than vitalik buterin on the second day of eath cc the first major ethereum event after kovid vitalik what's it like to be at east cc it's it's good to see people again i mean well i saw some people for the last one and a half years but definitely far fewer than i'm normally used to so yeah and so it's just good to see the lovely and friendly ethereum community in person and what about the east cc number four are you particularly excited about and also how have you seen this particular ethereum event be different than the other ones that you've been to in the past hmm i mean i guess i feel it feels like the ecosystem is just like slowly and steadily maturing like i i don't think there's necessarily like one a sort of zero to one sea change happening but i think that's a good thing right like i think the ecosystem has already for quite a while now just been on this sort of very good forward course and uh the projects keep getting better the kind of bar of uh stuff that people uh actually talk about at the at their presentations just keeps getting higher and things that keep getting more interesting so i think you know things in the ecosystem just keep improving and it's as obvious here as i as i was hoping there's a bunch of different tracks for ecc a bunch of different like lines of topics uh what's what's new that you are interested in and are there any talks out there that you're particularly excited to listen into or any talks that you enjoyed yesterday hmm let's see they're they were just like a scattering of a lot of different uh and interesting things right like there was there's at the there was the presentation on proof of humanity yesterday there was a carl talking about retroactive funding with his usual lovely carly presentation style um there were there was that interesting presentation earlier in the morning like talking about um cryptocurrency monetary policy and how cryptocurrency monetary policies could be used to incentivize different things so you know just a lot of different uh discussion from different people on a lot of different topics one theme that i've noticed is that we in previous ethereum events we had you know topics and conversations about possible products or possible future things and what's one thing i've noticed at this particular ecc is we have people talking about their next products not their first products have you noticed any anything like this as well um that's definitely true and then the other thing that's true of course is that people not just talking about their next products but people talking about their existing products right there's just so much fun existing stuff to talk about right like in all the previous um events even all the previous online events like uh optimism like and arbitrarily were future products and now you know optimism and or which one both have uh live uh versions on mainnet of some kind like uniswap just uh launched on optimism about a week ago um so no the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed i think as uh the phrase and yeah i mean i'll look i expect you know the future the future that's already here to just keep on getting even futurier over time vitalik vitalik ethereum is six years old and we've been having six years of conferences and i i i'm a big fan of east denver those were my first ethereum events and this is my first ecc event and the the community is so vibrant and there's so much energy here as one of the the the biggest creator of ethereum do you ever just sit and reflect on the magnitude of of what you've created you've you've made people fly around the world to come to france to go to denver how how do you how do you just think about the magnitude of the thing that you have created i mean the ethereum ecosystem is definitely much bigger than i was expecting it would end up being when i get first started in 2014 and 2015. so it's definitely a very strange and very unexpected journey i'm happy with what came out and i think uh there's just so much stuff that's uh happening now i mean both at the conference and everyone who who wasn't able to make it this time around but uh hopefully we'll be at defcon when it happens um it will uh be you know just like so much many fascinating and like interesting things you know not just being being like talked about in the future but actually just starting to run i think it's amazing metallica in the sixth long years that we've had ethereum how has the ethereum community and the builders on ethereum how have they exceeded your expectations as to what you might have predicted back in 2015 um um the quality of the tic of the technology and just the kinds of things that people figured out would be possible to do with technology is super impressive right like even zk snarks for example right like that was still you know we called that moon math back in the old days right and uh now i guess uh while we're i guess on the moon and uh what next i mean well there's mars math i guess what is that is that like obfuscation or something but no moon math is just like hey what you just like do some stuff with polynomials and like everyone knows what those are and uh you know you if you if you want scalability you just make proofs out of them right and that's just like one example out of many um so just the uh the kinds of tools that people have come up with that we could work with is um a lot and also the kind of uh collaboration that led to those things being possible right like eve like zika starks like that involved a collaboration between you know academics um ethereum people um other other kinds of uh mathematicians uh software developers and all the various people at the companies that actually made it happen a lot of kind of cross-institutional uh you know cross-country cross-world collaboration happening um so it's uh like that aspect of things i think is uh really great as well and then obviously even beyond zk starks like we've just been seeing all of the rise of these uh ethereum applications that just all talk to each other i i don't think i was actually even expecting the applications talking to each other part in uh 2014 at all i was just thinking about it as more like individual kind of super power you know super powerful uh i guess decentralized automatons but no no the uh the automaton isn't any one of the things that's like all the things what about the ethereum community uh do you think we could really work on or or what is what needs more attention that you think the ethereum community should point their attention towards so one of the things i'm going to talk about in my presentation in a couple hours is non-financial applications um so like right now the the main non-financial application that we have i think is nfts and like ens is an nft right um so no no no it's all nfts um always has been i don't know the um but uh like we could really go much further right like one of the um things that we recently released an rfp for was um ethereum based login um so we could use an ethereum accounts to just to log into other services and like if you imagine everyone having a social recovery wallet and then using that to log into services then you know you have distributed identities that are both more resistant against like basically centralized takeover and control than uh like twitter and facebook accounts and at the same time more likely to actually give you your account back if you lose it than twitter and facebook accounts are like we could really be yeah you know out competing centralized systems here um and then aside the um decentralized social media and or at least kind of crypto enabled social media various forms uh like that's the sort of thing that already exists within the crypto space in various forms right like you know like i just might you know disagree with the economics of like you know the schemes and the voices in some places but like the thing you can say about them is they're not ghost towns and um i think if the ethereum community uh kind of gets into trying to like build better um crypto social things then like we could actually come up with some of potentially like very powerful and much better things there too and then retroactive public goods funding that's um also amazing um so i think there's there's definitely lots of exciting things that we could work on um but like the key theme is and i've been saying this for a long time like at some points we have to kind of really start focusing on applications but i think this has become both more possible and more urgent you know the the mainstream if sauron is on the crypto space now right like this you know we got like elon musk tweeting about the about the doggy is um you know we've got all sorts of uh celebrities um regrettably uh kim kardashian pushing ethereum max um you know hopefully she listens up but like if not then i know maybe we can replace kim kardashian somehow um the [Music] uh challenge i guess like a lot of people really are putting a lot of hope into the crypto space to like actually walk the walk in terms of changing the world and making it more collaborative and opened and permissioned and like at some point we have to actually do that right and the good news is that like the biggest bottleneck to us doing anything which is scalability like that's being solved over the course of this year so yeah i mean there's a need and there's an opportunity and we should just go and do it vitalik you are known for putting your attention on things that the ethereum the rest of us kind of figure out a couple years later and right now as you just said we are in our like scalability summer we had uh you know optimism roll out we have uh or or soon to be you know now you can use unit swap soon you can use uh synthetics also arbitrage is now out there in in the wild uh but what are you paying attention to and what do you think we will be paying attention to after we're done with the whole scalability thing what comes next in ethereum um um so a few things right so one is uh privacy i think privacy still needs to be improved right like the whole like the blockchain is twitter for your bank accounts thing like i think it's being underrated but like if someone wants to sort of like put the magnifying glass on that problem in an accelerationist way they could just like make a twitter account that like tweets out whatever and someone makes a no that would actually be kind of mean but my goodness if the point is that the people who wants to peek at things are peeking at things and uh more and more people are gonna peek at things and like at some point so we need to actually improve the the privacy situation but you know like umbra exists tornado exists um but just ways to do at least basic things on ethereum without leaking everything to the world is something that we need to improve on um while it's security i keep uh harping on about social recovery wallets but i think like didn't we do multiple podcasts about those already like i don't know i think you know we just have to like keep on i get well i guess it's not just about harping it's about like actually yeah implementing and there's all these account abstraction like other challenges but like i think social recovery wallets just need to happen because like we need noob friendly security and like 24 word seeds they're not new friendly security like they might look they're definitely friendlier than what came before but still like uh you know what happens if your house burns down what happens if you accidentally lose that like these things happen um so that's another thing that needs to be improved quite a bit um and it's not just a like solving these problems is not just a matter of like having solutions instead of not having solutions it's also a matter of having decentralized solutions come fast enough that the centralized solutions don't get entrenched right like that's something that i am i definitely worry about quite a bit um what well what other things again i think no there's a long tail like there's just making blockchain applications easier to use there's like just security on the application side um there's uh i guess uh oh another one is uh making sure decentralized governance that's actually good like i've been yelling against coin voting for years and uh and like i worry that coin voting is just kind of like slowly getting adopted into slowly kind of i guess gaining legitimacy by continuity even though in my opinion it really doesn't deserve to but like at some point someone's gonna you know make the vote bribing app yeah and at some points like these things that looked really just nice and and secure by default are just suddenly gonna look much less secure and people are gonna start scrambling so i'm just hoping that we can come up with better alternatives before then uh vitalik there's a growing social scene about ethereum and so many different people are coming to the ethereum ecosystem because so many new things have come to ethereum the nft community has exploded the creator economy is really you know burgeoning and now we're all here in person at ecc so you know tell me about your thoughts and reflections about this the social layer that's growing around ethereum well i think as is uh the meme that you've uh also been uh spreading many times uh layer zero is people right and for a blockchain community to prosper it needs to have a community that people wants to all participate in and contribute to and i think that's actually something that the ethereum community has has done really well right like the community is supportive it's a very very like helpful and friendly to people just trying to join and do interesting things and i think that's something really valuable vitalik we are in paris how long are you in paris for i'm in paris for about another week anything exciting about being in paris that you're looking forward to after after ecc is done what are you up to uh i don't know i mean it's a it's a good city i'm sure i'll walk around and i'll explore it it's always good to be here the fruit the you know the food is good the architecture is good lots of things are good and there there's a decent party scene that's going around after eat cc is over we have the the ave rave tonight and a few other parties are you going to partake in the party scene i mean so far i've been kind of like keeping up the nine to five as in the sweep schedule um but i mean i don't know we'll see awesome well vitalik we've had you on the bankless podcast so many times before but this is the first time we've been able to do this in person and it's fantastic to be able to do this in person and i'm really excited to go to all the other future ethereum events for people that have not yet been to an ethereum event maybe pitch to them as to why it's unique and compelling and why they might be interested to come to one in the future yeah no and it's definitely been just great to be at the event i think it's uh just amazing to see all of the people doing um building all of the lovely things that make the ethereum ecosystem as great as it is in person and just being able to see in real time like the latest stuff that everyone is working on and everyone is and everyone is excited about and actually being able to just like talk to all of the other people that are just enthusiasts and fans of the ecosystem um so i think you know i think uh like going to these events once in a while was great well vitalik thank you for coming on the show and uh have i hope you have a fun rest of the time at ecc i hope you do too cheers all right banquo's nation i'm here with stani the one and only stani and we are here at the second day of eath cc stani tell us what it's like to be at east cc uh amazing i mean this is my third year here uh or ford i can't remember but the atmosphere is always good i mean you see like a lot of people from the ethereum community uh developers building interesting uh things and and also like you see the whole kind of like community here in real life and it's wonderful to see again like so many nerds in a like a physical uh uh presence so cool yeah it is a a place of for for nerds who are also really really social and i feel i feel like that's always kind of like the through line of ethereum events it's like nerds who want to hang out and talk nerdy stuff um and so sonny you had a talk uh yesterday morning can you give the people who weren't able to watch the talk a little bit of a preview about what that was about yeah definitely so uh the talk was more about credit delegation so uh now in decent class finance for example which ava has been building for for the past couple of years and been contributing to uh it's about getting liquidity into the d5 space so getting uh dollars into crypto dollars and yield bearing crypto dollars and now kind of like with this credit delegation we're thinking how you would get this kind of like a big defile liquidity pool uh and use it in real economy and funding things that uh couldn't be fun before like young entrepreneurs um emerging uh businesses and uh creative delegation allows to take under collateralized loans and build this trust network so that's what it's all about and kind of like showing how decentralization can actually help the real economy and not just the kind of like a uh like a smaller group of bfi enthusiasts i think one of the themes that i'm seeing a lot at ecc is that we are a lot of projects and presenters are presenting the next products rather than their first products right so you know ethan turned into ave and then ave had its use cases built out and proven as its first products and now your presentation was about here's a product that i think we should do next and that's meaningfully different for an ecosystem that needed to that we are no longer proving out our first use cases we are now talking about the next products that we are going to build rather than our first products do you have any thoughts or reflections on that yeah i think like what's what's interesting is kind of like inspire other people and developers like what you can build and the talk of like trade delegation was about like showing like what kind of capabilities you can build and avi has reached into a point as a genesis team that we uh we're just finalizing the latest version of our protocol the the version two point five or three however uh the camden wants to name it and then we we move to build kind of like a next layer of of dfi and and the other protocols but the credit delegation idea is that we want to show something that is possible and just inspire other developers to build those things on top of uh this functionality and show like the potential and why we're trying to do this because we had similar kind of like experience with slash loans so uh beginning of last year we implemented the flashlight feature into the ave protocol and it wasn't used very much but then when we started to actually promote the use cases what you can actually do with flash loans we started to see like different kinds of uh usage and now there's like a uh billions of words of flashlight flashlights from other protocol during this year so it's kind of like shows that if you can inspire developers help them out um and just kind of evangelize uh the functions like people will start to build yeah as it turns out marketing does work uh so we are at hcc number four which is the first ethereum defy crypto event uh other than bitcoin 2021 to really happen after covid and like you said you were also at east dc number three which was the last event before covet happened how is ec4 different from the previous eccs and the other crypto events that you've been to in the past what's new and how is the energy field different at this particular event i think during this you see definitely like the the gap and covered in everything maybe i would say brought a lot of kind of like new audiences into the space as defense started to scale we saw scaling with the nft community creators coming into the space essentially what you saw kind of like i would say new demographics entering into web 3. and what's interesting here is that now we kind of like are expanding the the community just not being only like nerds excited about decentralization and you know like coding but actually into your community that it that looks like a uh kind of like a society and and um and i'm very excited about this because we get more professionals uh more creators and and and just like more diverse uh ecosystem and this is what ave is all about we we are about inclusivity being able to expand our technology and and just empower as many kind of demographic as as we can so uh this has been like the the progress during and i think it's because a lot of content went to internet people had more time to research and and explore and this is probably the reason that we we we see this expansion but we have still a lot of work to do if you want to get uh webster into mainstream mm-hmm are there who's talks or or uh the speakers or panelists at ecc are you really looking forward to what really excites you about the uh the potential talks that are uh coming out uh in the next couple days there's quite a lot of talks and actually there's there's multiple talks at the same time and and various topics and uh what i usually do i try to look at the talks afterwards because i'm trying to be here as available as possible for for the community but uh one of the talks that is always like inspiring for me is what with alex uh talks and mainly because uh there's always kind of like a this um bigger message on on what we could should build and vitalik usually tries to also highlight uh parts that are a bit of like uh underserved and this is something that how ava has grown itself we were always trying to serve like underserved markets and empower communities whether it's asset listings or whatnot uh and trying to just get new demographics and this is something uh which is very interesting if everyone's at home i can watch later uh vitalik stark are pretty good and of course uh there's a talk i'm going after this uh by uh dean uh man and he's talking about memes so i'm very curious to see what's going on there uh and and memes are very important i mean like you remember beginning of all there was just like a lot of memes all the time and you know someone said that i'm the uh kind of like a me meme lord of ava so yeah ave is one of the projects that made it through the bear market i think memes are the way that like people keep themselves entertained and keep themselves going through bear markets and so it's it's no surprise that like the ethereum community is like really meme friendly uh before i have a few more questions but before i before i get there i want to ask about ave pro uh that we've been hearing some rumors about ave pro uh is there any kind of details that you could share is any release dates or or what can we expect with obvi pro yeah one one interesting update is other pro is now our arc so we ran the product to be a bit more sexier but one interesting part is actually the avi arc is is about it's the same infrastructure infrastructure smart convex infrastructure we have in in in currently deployed in ethereum uh and in polygon and tomorrow somewhere else uh the the only difference is that we added a functionality called whitelisters which allows you to deploy a completely new market uh so-called private market so you can decide uh what kind of liquidity you accept there so it's not just only asset listing and onboarding but also you can whitelist their liquidity sources uh and and uh borrowing who is providing liquidity borrowing it and who is liquidating and this brings the use case of so-called like private pools if you want to create a market where you have less assets more assets or you have certain kind of like additional requirements let's say you want to use d5 but you you might have some compliance requirements that let's say you want to use the transparency of dfid the ability of using self executing smart contract instead of paper agreements and having a network of counterparties uh and and of course like the liquidity uh then you can use use uh the arc market and build yourself this kind of like a market and what we are trying to like achieve in the longer term is that we get more institutionals to kind of like a test on on how d5 works and how they actually benefit from from using this interest finance the transparency the efficiency of the smart contracts and hopefully they will forget uh all the kind of like what's happening in traditional finance with piper agreements and everything and move towards uh like permissionless decentralized finance so what sort of signals have you gotten from institutions that they are actually looking for a product like this or are you kind of just building it and hoping that they'll figure it out yeah this product is completely based on demand so so demand has been very very strong before the product itself and once we kind of like there was more people got interested in it and and there was like more uh publicity about the product uh there's even more interest so uh we have um pretty much from institutional sides there's uh hedge funds uh market makers and and banks and it's actually very amazing to see that uh kind of like institutions and banks that i would never expect to even look into the fire looking towards the ark market so that's going kind of like very fascinating to see like how much it has drawn traction for them and on the complete opposite side of the spectrum ave is throwing a rave tonight and how do you pronounce it are you calling it uh the rave or the the rave or what what are we calling this i think it's from it so yeah so it's it's kind of like rave of it and the thing is that uh we we planned in in uh previous conference in mbtc miami that um we um uh we want to throw a rave and and you know we drop coordinates and ask people to do come there but then then you know i was the only person there from from ave and and of course ajit was there so we were too so we were like okay maybe there's isn't it stuff stuff to throw at rave party so we're going to do it today and the idea is just kind of like to show that you know uh like the ethereum community is is sort of about building like um empowering but also it's kind of like having fun meeting people and and building new friendships because it's not only about like smart contract-based composibility but also like human composibility is very important and i mean this is how we became friends and and everyone else in the space and this is something this relationship will last longer and what's funny is that some of our like transactioning and kind of like interactions happen on chain and we can always go back and look like what we did then you know it's interesting to see like how our like human relationships will will be like uh empowered with blockchain yeah earlier you talked about how we are as a community turning into a society right not not only we are no longer in the phase of you know builders only in in ethereum and d5 we are now also like the culturalists in nfts and now there's games and in in addition to the expansion of d5 i really like how you call that a society now we're all all partying together sony how late are you going to be up tonight well that's a good question you know uh i guess like i i mean it's robbed so you know it's it's very very like hard to leave and and i think i think that will be the case for everyone tomorrow i i have a very early uh uh um meeting tomorrow at 8 am so it's going to be very tricky and interesting at the same time but i definitely agree like this is becoming like a very cultural movement and and just like uh especially when my stream are coming more into the space uh there's they're raising questions that are very important like ecological impact of let's say proof of work and things that we need to consider over kind of like as we scale to the mainstream so i'm very happy that this is becoming like a larger culture how many people are going to be going to this event and what's the capacity uh i think in total we are at 500 so so there is kind of like a rooftop party first and then we have a basement where they actually rather will be so uh let's see there's like a all tickets went quite quickly um i mean they're free of course and and we try to invite as many as we can but we have certain limitation and uh yeah i mean i'm i'm very excited to to see like a lot of uh friends there so ave has the defy app for all the the retail people like you and me it's also building out the institution with arve ark it's also dabbling in into the party scene and the social scene donnie do you ever just like sit back and reflect as to the magnitude of the thing that you just built because it's spanning off into so many it's got so many different tentacles at like everywhere and like everyone knows ave the branding is phenomenal that you guys have your own like memes and graphics on on discord the thing is just turning into an absolute monster like how do you like just reflect on just the magnitude of the thing that you just built it's hard to it's hard to kind of like even uh uh even measure it because like it's just growing and deeply small like ave is still small i mean if you look at something like google with like tens of thousands of employees you know we're still like obvious 65 60 something employees so it's very small but i do believe that protocol will be bigger than businesses bigger than nations because of the advantage of the efficiency and these protocols will become as a decentralized organizations in a powerful position to actually uh move not just move culture but you know empower different kinds of societies for example if there is a cause in some part of the world that adults can actually contribute funding their uh inflation and actually empower a lot of people so i guess like we're moving to very interesting uh models but as of we definitely like we are a web 3 builder company so we we built the the albert protocol which is now the the biggest d5 protocol and as we have built it and now the community is is governing it and and continue continuing to uh improving it uh the next step is pretty much like build the next innovation and just decentralize different kinds of uh web3 businesses into something that our community owned owned by the users and and governed transparently on chain and that's the kind of like a goal that we are trying to achieve and this goal is the same that for example ethereum has and and is in general in in in battery sony last few questions for you for people that have never been to an ethereum or crypto event pitch them as to why they should consider coming in the future well uh there might be a chance that we throw another rob that's a great reason yeah and i think it's just kind of like seeing actually the culture that is happening uh especially the bigger events uh are very cool defcon is uh might not happen this year if it happens nice but if it doesn't next year it's a very like uh interesting to see like how uh diversity communities and just see very amazing talks and and there's so many ideas flying around and so many ways to contribute and and this is an event where you can bring your family of course after like the kobe then everything is over and and just have a lot of fun and enjoy and i think this is a place where uh kind of like ideas come together people come together to build innovate get inspired and and just take a lot of things back to home and spread the the kind of like uh idea of decentralization and and make uh you know world more transparent and and and also finance better and and other areas where web 3 isn't yet kind of like touch upon so there's a lot of opportunities here sony we've had you on the bankless podcast but that was over zoom it's fantastic to be able to do this in person with you and if crypto and that's the whole point of crypto right like if we don't actually meet in the physical world and and take over in the physical world we all want crypto to take over but it actually needs to happen in the physical world and so it's fantastic to be able to talk to you and do this uh face-to-face and i hope to do this many more times into the future totally thanks for having me here it's it's very amazing and being like this physically and and actually you're real so it's nice to see well cheers johnny thank you so much all right guys i'm here with kane warwick of synthetics here on the second day of eth cc kane what's it like to be at ecc tell us about your experiences so far it's very weird to be uh back at a conference seeing all these people that haven't seen in like two years it's but it's been really fun it's been good to catch up with people and the vibe is uh is amazing and some of the talks been really cool as well so how did you get out of australia tell us about that process it was not easy um i needed to prove to the government that you know i was speaking here there was economic benefit to australia um that we had our offsite in mexico which is uh coming up in about a week um so it was a long process uh to get out of here and uh a bit expensive but well worth it so you're telling me that anthony cesano could have made it but he didn't maybe he's uh just not famous enough i don't know i can't really know who that guy is i think uh maybe the economic benefit that he brings to australia is just uh not quite above the line so um apologies asano but uh yeah i think uh maybe next time i'll uh try and help him escape he can jump into my bags or something uh can you have a talk coming up later today uh for people that won't be able to watch it in person can you kind of give them a little teaser about what it's about yeah so uh i published a blog post uh a couple weeks ago about dao capital formation so you know raising funds directly into adele so you can start a new community a new project um so it's gonna be kind of covering the highlights of that um and then obviously answering some questions uh you know about specifics of how that whole process works um and yeah probably also uh i guess answering some questions about my return uh to synthetics or the return to synthetic so yeah and then are there any other talks that are being uh giving out today from other people that are you particularly excited about and looking forward to um yeah there's a couple things um probably i think the obviously vitalik's talk is gonna be good um and then there's some gaming talks uh which are pretty interesting um and uh i think there is another talk uh later this afternoon um those going into like some other governance things as well so yeah um you know i mean yesterday i went to maybe seven different uh talks and they were all amazing so it's been a really really good lineup i think a lot of people have banked up a lot of content for the last two years ready to present so so this isn't your first ethereum event um but it's definitely the first ethereum event since kovid right so what's the vibe like for you and how is this particular ecc different than the other ects that you might have been to in the past or the other ethereum or d5 events that you've been to i think the last uh eighth event that i went to is maybe edcon um in sydney um which is pre-covered i may have i may have gone to something else like late 2019 um but yeah like in 2020 obviously no events um it's again like the vibe is definitely uh pretty excited i think everyone's you know uh there's so much has been built over the last two years um so many things that you know had been promised or you know people were expecting or whatever have kind of come about um obviously some other things that are like getting really close as well like l2 scaling super exciting um so yeah i just think like overall the ecosystem is so vibrant there's so many people building things and and so many you know cool projects that i've run into while i've been here um it's been amazing so we are all here in person which is actually relatively new for for us as an ecosystem at least for the last year or so uh and you know there's a bunch of faces from from crypto twitter and from from discord that everyone's relatively familiar with what's it like to be meeting all the people that you've been talking to online for the past year i mean it's it's been really fun to meet people that you know i've obviously met before in the past and i've spent time with um but i think particularly the people that i've never met before it's been you know even more interesting right like you know we've never met in person it's kind of weird one interesting component i guess is obviously we don't have masks on right now but everyone's wearing masks so there's been a bunch of people i've walked up to and we're kind of like looking at each other like do we know each other like martin from gnosis was like is that kane and i was like who and he's like martin and you take them off oh okay so it's a bit of like a masquerade uh ball as well like you can't tell who's behind a mosque so um yeah it's been but it's been fun um it's been super exciting and then you know we've had a chance to hang out with people after the conference as well which has been cool so when people are coming up to meet you what are they asking you about what are people particularly interested in and asking you about uh synthetic stuff or or anything else related to that it's been a range of things you know there's been some conversations about governance um like even you know today on twitter we were talking about like representative democracy versus direct democracy um and i think you know that's probably the thing that like has always stood out for me uh like even just then i was talking to fernando about like um liquidity distribution and yield yield farming distributions and we were talking about the ins and outs of it like it's always been uh very kind of technical straight to the point questions like you you run into someone you start having a conversation you just go down a crazy rabbit hole like really quickly um and i just think from like an intellectual standpoint it's super stimulating it's really fun so um yeah that's been uh that that hasn't changed uh since uh you know covered so it's cool so with all these crypto events that we have that it's not just the event but it's also the peripheral and satellite events that happen after ecc uh what are you excited about to go do outside of the conference i mean rave is on tonight and i think that's probably going to be the highlight of the conference for everyone um it's funny when uh when i was leaving um you know like i've got all these things on my calendar all these different appointments and my wife was like it looks like you're going to a rave but it was funny actually because this is how crypto she is she was like what's this rave thing and i was like oh she even pronounced it right so um so yeah i think uh i think people are pretty excited for that um but you know i've just like been catching up with people going for drinks and you know going to a couple events and dinners and stuff so um yeah just having a chance to kind of sit down with people for a couple of hours in person and chat to them has been amazing so uh how late are you gonna stay up tonight uh i'm i've managed to stay up until midnight i got to like about 12 30 last night um i'm still a little bit jet-lagged hopefully i can push through to like two tonight that's my goal i know it closes at four but we'll see if i can stay till two i'll i'll think i've done pretty well awesome and uh what are you really just excited for to uh with the remainder of your time in paris uh paris pretty cool city i don't know if you've been around europe a lot but after after ecc what are you going to do just in the city of paris so i'm hanging out here for another couple of nights um there's a few people staying on obviously at the conference and just going to catch up with them and then i'm headed to new york after that so looking forward to catching up with the the new york crypto scene as well there's a bunch of people that already hit me up so um yeah so that's going to be really fun so it's a bit of like a crypto world tour for me yeah trying to avoid going back home as long as possible huh yeah yeah absolutely um i think when uh when i initially uh kind of proposed it they want you to obviously stay out of the country as long as possible they don't want you kind of coming back um but luckily we also have our global synthetics off-site so a bunch of the core contributors from the western hemisphere getting together in mexico so that's kind of my last stop which is going to be even crazier because there's people in the core contributors and and in the synthetics community who i've been you know working closely with for like almost two years who i've never met um so it's gonna be pretty amazing so i'm i'm really excited for that and i'm glad that i could uh get out and go and join that conference so for for people that have never been to an ethereum or defy event maybe pitch to them as to what they might be interested in if they actually did decide to come out to an event in the future i think someone posted this on twitter um you know bitcoin conferences and and even like general crypto conferences like consensus um you know the talks and panels like in the nicest possible way they're usually kind of there's not a huge amount of value i think with the uh with ethereum conferences there's so many people pushing uh the kind of state of the art in so many different directions that it's actually hard to even kind of choose like there were multiple times yesterday where i had like conflicting talks that i wanted to go to one was late and i would like scramble out to the other one um so i think like the amount of content that you can kind of consume in a two-day period is pretty amazing and you know obviously we all read newsletters we all you know listen to podcasts and and you know read the different blogs and everything but having someone on stage kind of you know pitch it to you directly being able to then and you know ask questions they answer them there is something about that that like i think um you know just kind of sticks with you a little bit more um and so making the effort to like come in person and some of those just serendipitous conversations that happen um are amazing as well but like making the effort come in person the amount of like just brain dump that you get after like a two or three day conference is just incredible kane we've had you on the bankless podcast before but that was over zoom uh this is actually in person which is new for me as well so it's fantastic to actually meet you in person and be able to actually have this conversation face to face yeah thanks it was it was super fun um and as i said before i'm uh i need to go and frantically claim my bank tokens because i've been holding off i'm procrastinating so that's my next task after i get out of uh the studios uh jump on my laptop and grab them i've got a few weeks left to do that yeah they will expire for you the listener as well yeah kane thank you for coming on the show amazing thank you so much great to meet you all right guys i am here with jerome d t shea jerome is the lead host the lead organizer of ecc the event that we all find ourselves at today uh now that ec cc is actually here and we're all here jerome uh how do you feel like are you excited what's going on in your head i'm mainly feeling relieved to be honest like we didn't we didn't know not if but when we were we would be able to watch this thing um so i've been with the term francis the beginning as the president since 2016 uh and we've been hosting this conference for the fi fif fourth first time yeah first time uh we did five conference because we did etcon in paris back in 2017 uh but we're very happy to have this conference as a recruiting event that's always happening in paris always gathering everyone roughly at the same time in the year in paris um and getting everybody together at in paris is awesome like i think it's really really nice to see everyone coming together after like 15 months of not seeing each other we had the privilege of being the largest conference of 2020 since we were whatever the last one uh and now well opening up the the new season yeah if cc was the the last event before everything really shut down and now it's also the first event to really kick things off as things uh open up again you know fingers crossed it stays opened up so we're all optimistic about that but as the person that has been to all four ecc events can you kind of illustrate for people who haven't been to any of the previous ones or or people like me who are this is my first one tell us about the trajectory of you know one through four how have they changed and grown and developed over time yeah so we we matured uh at the same pace of the ecosystem basically so initially we wanted to host a conference that would be community based uh and recurring at the same times of the year at the same place because by the time edcon was moving every year uh defcon was moving every year and we just wanted to say well let's make it easy like you don't know if you're going to be able to travel to bogota if you're going to be able to travel to to japan well yeah let's just go and stay in paris all the time so we started with this by i think it's organized by each and friends the non-profit that i mentioned before was hosting the uh interim front's website as well translating things in french for for the french-speaking community and as nonprofits we basically say well we have connections with engineering schools in france so we just wanted to like host an event there uh calculate how much it would cost to do live streaming uh divided by the number of people that we are thinking about having and say well okay it's going to be 200 per person and we are going to have a balanced budget so we started off in 2018 with this uh and the excitement was huge because it was like the trajectory of the rule previous bull market so we were like yeah sure let's go to see a conference and everybody was so lovely so happy so easy going to to to work with uh that we decided to organize it one year once again at the same place uh next year so the first edition had about 700 people the second edition in 2019 had about 1 000 people and on the third edition that we did last year we were thinking about going up to 2000. uh we had commitments we had lots of speakers and unfortunately well coveted hits so all the speakers that came from asia couldn't come most of the speakers that came from the us canceled uh but we still were able to host the conference and have it uh have it balanced and everything uh running and now we are hosting the 21st season season and it's going great like we could have probably 5 000 people at the same time but unfortunately due to the sanitary restriction we had to have a hard cap of 1000 but expect us to run this conference again next year and make it super duper big again and the core value that we tried to convey with this conference is to say well it should be accessible so a ticket to atc is usually 300 euros or so so it's pretty pretty accessible for anyone compared to most tech conference where you pay thousands to get in um and we have lots of talks next to each other like everything happening in parallel so we have a ratio of about one person out of five that is a speaker so you meet the doers and that creates this kind of cool interaction colombians where you just bump into speakers all the time i want to keep growing at this space making sure that we stay at least at the one out of six one out of four uh people that are coming to speak uh not coming to be on a panel and discuss a topic without preparing anything that i'm against on panel but you know uh it takes commitment when it takes people to to demonstrate what they are going to talk about uh to really make something exciting so we're going to continue this uh this stage jerome you talked about how there were there's just so many different rooms and panelists and the speakers are also being in in other speakers audiences and the future audience members are the the next speakers uh that kind of just overall kind of reminds me of the ethereum ecosystem at large like users and investors and builders they're all the same they're all the same cohorts we're all the we're all the same people here tell me a little bit more about how ecc is like resonant with the ethos that we find in ethereum at large um welcoming open um cheap to go lots of great content that's that's what we want to uh we want to demonstrate um ethereum friends is a nonprofit like we aim at balancing the budget keeping the price of the ticket as low as possible uh so i think we are about 300 euro for the three days of conference and we want this conference to have the greatest amount of content that you take out of it so here's our wall we try to have as many um as many tracks in parallel that we can and make the conference long as long as we can um so it ends up with a nice ratio of number of speakers and numbers of attendees uh making it that one person out of five is actually talking about what they are building right now um so if you are new to this field you end up in this super interest ecosystem where you meet all of the people that are building this you meet rock stars that you've heard about on the internet or you meet the the builders of this or you meet the guy that just started this this new new gig and want to recruit and it's it's it's a very welcoming environment um and everybody is easygoing and everyone wants to share um i think we wouldn't have got the same uh the same crowd or the same the same ito's if we were an expensive conference and doing it commercially so i'm very happy that we have been long-lasting and sticking to our to our initial uh values and and over the years you know we we tried to get different crowds to come also because the price of fees improved and the attention from the media changed a little bit um so for us we we wanted to continue this education purpose that we have in uh in our in our main goals at ethereum france and it translated into opening an interim vc track so vcs can come to hcc but have to pay for it like we are not going to beg them to come and pay them the trip like hey you want to meet the com the the community you just attend like everyone um but you get a a nurtured uh deal flow of uh of companies that are coming to speak on technical topics at fcc uh being in front of the of the corridors of ethereum being in front of the the main doors of ethereum well you get something that's neutral and clean um so they they are coming uh in huge amounts of number of vc's like it's just uh it's just mind-blowing we don't think we have 50 or 60 funds that are attending this year and so for for our ecosystem that initially financed it with icos and and token token emissions um it's a shift towards i think more more uh resilience in their financial structure to have some vcs in in their in their rounds and for us as organizer of the conference it's becoming future people that we want to sponsor the conference so we want to come every year or we want to do product release here uh aves has done great demo this morning uh i think i missed sushi swap demo or wow yeah but anyway uh yeah everything is happening there and it's uh it's really great to see that are there any panels or guests or topics or you know talks that you are particularly excited about anything that comes to mind well we don't do that much panels we prefer to have speakers that come and talk about something they are passionate about or talk about something they've been working on for some time um in our experience with panels that they are great for after shows and great for having many people come together around the drink and discuss the topic and then talk with the rest of the of the assembly uh at sec most most of the speakers if not 100 of the speakers are just doing a talk like you prepare something you present something you give us an abstract to work on and say like hey it sounds interesting like you're not the the the 100s person that is going to talk about the future of defy yeah well everybody wants to talk about that um and one thing i'm super excited about is of course vitalik speaking tomorrow about uh how to do good with d5 uh well probably e-stake on dfi is interesting so this is definitely the d fire we have a track uh the d5 track is like three or four times the size of the other track uh and it's hard for us to keep it to keep the well balanced having having great diversity in the different side of talks and i'll go to the the zika snack and zika roll up workshops that's going to happen on on thursday so there's a lot of people who you know had to stay home not ecc can't host everyone but i'm sure there's a lot of people that you know maybe they were on the edge and then they decided for whatever reason to not come why should they have come and why should they think about coming to ethereum events like this in the future so being totally unbiased this is the best interim conference in the world at least last year it was one of the last on one of the only so we keep we keep that uh we give that to yourself uh i hope to continue to be able to host it this way um the thing is if you go to paris it's easy to reach so first thing paris is a capital is easy to reach usually from wherever you are in the world uh it's a full week of events so you get something for the trip uh the conference itself it's not that expensive we tried to be one of the cheapest of the of the ecosystem and you can have a whole week of stuff happening so the ideal htc uh on the normal sedentary situation is that we have a job fair on the monday you meet vcs you meet people you meet probably your new employer or you meet your your new colleagues um you have three to four days of conference and then you have a hackathon and around that you get parties all the time like or events all the time or side things happening all the time and um if you are grounded like if you cannot come you cannot travel uh we are an open source promoting association so everything is available online the all the talks are live streamed and available right away like one hour or so after the day directly on youtube so like check it out if you cannot come just be there look look look at look at here look at the conference from your remote place and hit us on telegram you just on the on on twitter we're very happy to uh to talk with you and do apply to the speaker call uh that you will probably publish in november so last question for you jerome after ecc is over either at the end of today tomorrow or thursday what other events are you excited about that you're going towards um so well i my my my main body years was 10 years ago like when i was uh when i was at school uh and uh back then the the the music crowd in paris was the french touch crowd you know the end but bangers uh daft punk justice and so on and the the rv team managed to get all the djs from this lab label to come and play tomorrow night so i'm very excited about that uh i still have to work on my presentation for the closing talks so i hope i don't get too too excited during this uh this this party but that's definitely something i will i will head to uh there is the ledger closing party also that i'm really looking forward to because on the rooftop near the sun it's going to be a beautiful setup um well i think i'm mentioning only parties but uh yeah i need i need to take the to take some uh some of the pressure off after this uh this organization um and i'm taking a small trip to uh to family place after the conference but yeah so i'm i'm mainly staying for hcc and looking at a couple of side events uh and uh being super busy finalizing the last thing that needs to be finalized um but i think there is a hackathon being organized this weekend that i would done yeah i won't be able to attend um but i i think coin find is running it and it's a super exciting stuff being built around nft with them so it should be it should be cool i i follow that from uh from my my uh holiday place awesome jerome well as somebody who really thoroughly enjoys meeting real-life crypto people in the real world and i do believe that eventually crypto will come to take over the world and so we also need to come together in the real world as a community so thank you for just organizing ecc you know for the last four years and continuing to do it into the future as well well definitely thanks for coming that's uh those events happen because people are coming we try to make everything easy so they can come and so far they decided to and that's great for us and you can count on us to host it again next year i'm possible all right guys i'm here and pleased to be joined with aya maya gucci of the ethereum foundation aya you just got done with a talk here at ecc and for those that weren't able to attend can you kind of give them a preview about what you talked about i spoke about um ethereum infinite garden and how i see like what's the most special about ethereum i think and and um and then this was about like it's not just about the technology it's actually the the the people and how how the community members play um in the infinite garden of ethereum which is that um basically this is not really about winning this is really the game is supposed to continue right and then so you play for the purpose of continuing to play so that was the talk and then also i introduced one of her fellows of the eastern foundation fellowship program this is the first cohort and and then she explained the the project that she's working on which is the giga and to to connect schools with internet and then also provide transparency and also like all their better governance and everything with the power of ethereum so and then also i introduced her as um one of the gardeners of the infinite garden i love that that metaphor about ethereum as a garden and in the ethereum world we're all about long-term games and iterative games and we are finally back into the world of more ethereum events in real life real real events and so now that we are all back as a community in ecc once again for the fourth ever ecc what are you really excited to see or who are you excited to see talk or what are you about ecc are you particularly excited for in general just like everyone knows i was excited to like get together with with other people again this is it's been a while and also you know like ef organized devcon and we've been like kind of postponing it for for many times and and then um we kind of appreciate ecc to organize this like uh like almost the first first event to happen after the call it started to happen and then uh so i think the whole devcon team is here to learn like what it's like you know how people are like experiencing this after the time that people were waiting so yeah and also like the combination of their thing that i wanted to send like the message that i wanted to send which is about the infinite garden and also i kind of wanted to see how people are enjoying like after a while so that was yeah that was that was my my goal to come here and then i'm also excited about the different talks and then there's some like they have this blockchain for good track and and um and there are some stuff that i didn't know so i'm i'm looking forward to learn about what they're doing aya the ethereum community is now six years old and you've been with it every step of the way what are you most proud about on behalf of the community that we've gotten that we've achieved in the last six years uh well i haven't been i've been in the crypto space for the entire time but even before ethereum but i'm um so um you know i haven't been part of the ethereum thing like for the whole time but i i think it's even as a external audience for like as a participant i think it's amazing that how what this community has achieved working like in a fully decentralized way basically like ef doesn't really manage and uh like recording it that's what we say and that that's still like very continuous effort to make it as decentralized as possible um that that technical advancements that ethereum has made is such a hard like uh problem to solve and you know like people said in the beginning oh there's no way they can do it and but we are seeing that it's actually happening now especially when the proof of stake is happening and then so yeah and then now this is actually involving outside people outside and then they can also see oh wow this is this is actually serious and this is happening and and um so it's great to it's not like i you know i'm proud but i just feel proud to be part of it and on the on the other side of things what do you think the ethereum community and ecosystem still needs to work on what do we have left to achieve that's still on the table hmm so i don't know if it's left to achieve but there are not a lot of like technical challenges that still needs to achieve but that one of the things that i mentioned in my talk is um yes there's an infinite garden and the way we keep playing this game but then like unless we are conscious this this uniqueness uh can be lost so i think it's really important for us to remember what's special about ethereum and like this vibe you feel at ecc and like you just don't feel that anywhere else um so yeah i think it's very very important for us to maintain so that this stays very unique and interesting and really like not about winning you said the vibe that we feel at ecc can you put that into words what is the vibe of each cc the thing is there's certain seriousness um like what people talk about like some like a you know like geeky conversation about technical things of course because it's an ethereum event but but then there's like always down-to-earth openness that uh you get to come talk to anyone and then they're open to answer to your questions so that um you don't feel that i mean like we feel that at that point too but we don't maybe feel that at a regular business conference or so that um the openness openness and the down-to-earth vibe and also like you basically people are always ready to be open to have conversation with anyone and and i always loved that vibe about any ethereum events that definitely resonates with me i think that the moment i realized that i wanted to be an ethereum was that my first ethereum event ever east denver and it was just a matter of the conversations and the people that i met at the ethereum event i made me realize that it's not something that i wanted to miss uh i didn't really know what ethereum was at the time i didn't really know what i could contribute at the time but it i just knew it's something that i didn't want to you know read in a book later i wanted to be a part of it as a as it grows and and speaking of experiencing it we are on camera here on at bank list while we are also on camera for the infinite garden so so uh tell us what it's like to be a part of a story of ethereum's first like high production movie documentary what's that like yeah so this is um very it's has been very interesting because um like i explained about infinite garden the idea itself when i first talking to the team um the crew optimus team and then you know they were still learning about what this was about when i was learning about them but we gradually felt like this this like alignment that okay like i think i believe this team actually understands and so i started to trust them and it's just like idea it's not just i i gave one inspiration but then it has evolved in the way that all other community members gave them ideas and it's still evolving right so we don't know because they just started and they just finished the fundraising achieve the fundraising and um so it's i like this ex almost like an experiment like this i don't know this how normally regular documentary is made but um yeah it's been like discoveries for both of us but also for them to learn about and then now they actually understand a lot of like um things in ethereum that um like it's hard to catch up with everyone um or everything but but um but i'm very very excited how this is gonna come that i don't even know how this is gonna um become but but um but i can see that that you know like a positive vibe coming from people from the community members and the support from everyone and this was like i heard that you know even the creative production side is um because this was raised in a way that like a decentralized way um so yeah i'm i'm actually i didn't know when we started this how this was gonna go but i'm very very excited how things are going and i'm just looking forward to see the unknown yet yeah so my my last question for you is you know we're not totally out of the woods yet with regards to covid but you know we're all here together we're in paris what are you looking forward to in paris uh after ecc is over do you have any cool paris plans uh i don't have plans yet but i'm huge i'm a huge fan of natural wine and then paris is the france is the biggest you know place for that um i was actually just in tokyo before coming over here um yeah and then i even saw an event happening tonight that people are going to talk about um the the ethereum feel good and then also drinking natural wine that kind of thing like it just never happens uh if you want to impress so yeah but i i mean if i start talking about natural mind i talk too much so i will stop there ethereum for good and natural wine uh that's the place i would expect to find imi gucci so i uh thank you for for coming on the show and telling us your ecc experience thank you very much when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various d5 exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless alright guys i'm here with cooper turley cooper uh how excited are you for ecc tell me all about it i am super excited this time last year i got covered at this very conference so it's very great to be back wearing masks feeling healthy feeling good life is great yeah we didn't really have a mass this time last year for ecc a little bit a little bit uh naive at that time but we really didn't know what's coming i know you're excited for the resurgence of crypto events and ethereum events but specifically with this ecc event what are you excited about um just on this one i'm really excited just to hear about the progress that's been made you know i think that a lot has happened over the last year we've been living online i think this is the first time where people can come and talk about things irl for me that's where you really get a vibe of like which projects have the most attention and energy just based off what people are talking about at these events so it's great to go a little bit beyond twitter discord telegram you know see people irl and hear what's uh really exciting and worth paying attention to definitely one of the biggest innovations in the last year while we were all home is stuffs in both dows and nfts which are largely uh you know status and social games right like dowser social communities and nfts are largely uh things that are about you know status which is inherently a social phenomenon so i think it's actually really cool that a lot of these events that are coming out of kovid are dao and nft i have dao and nft themes and i know that you are particularly focused in the world of dao's and also the creator economy which is also a social element as well and you just came out of your talk so can you guy for the people that are you know were at home and weren't able to attend ecc can you kind of give them a little teaser of what your talk was about yeah absolutely so i gave a talk on the future of music you know as you said i think this is an industry that's right for social and financial disruption and so for me being able to talk about you know how nfts play a role in the future of audience how governance makes sense in a more broader context you know i just love this design space of every creator feeling like they're they're on the startup now and so being able to take these tools and apply them in uh you know with crypto and non-crypto native ways that's kind of the intersection i sit at how do you take it down make it understandable to someone who's never used metamask before and how do you use tools like co-op to basically do nfts at irl events despite the fact that no one's ever set up a wallet previous to that and so uh who and or what panels are you really looking forward to to speaking about you know in there's always that that funny little line where the the audience looks towards one artist but then that artist is they're they're met like uh their savant or their person that they're interested in is somebody else so who's the person that cooper is interested in seeing on stage talking i mean it's going to be a cliche answer but i think vitalik is going to be fantastic you know i love coming to see him talk irl because you never know what he's going to talk about they kind of always give you something to look forward to a little bit further along so obviously he's not super active on twitter and so being able to hear about what he's been pontificating on over the past year we've been locked in covet it should be a good way to just refresh and see where things are at yeah vitalik has a habit of delivering always really hot keynotes and i'm also excited for that one as well uh for for people that weren't able to attend ecc can you kind of tell them what's the vibe like from your perspective and how does this ecc event differ from the one last year and also other crypto events that you've been to yeah it's a great question i mean i think of ecc as a community conference so obviously there's a lot of developers here there's a lot of ecosystem partners you know where this stuff differs from maybe like a devcon or an eth global event is that this is much more community focused you're going to see a hundred talks over the course of three days you're going to hear about a bunch of different projects while there's a bunch of builders here i think that this talk is about uh conference context basically leave this conference feeling like you have a good understanding of where the industry's at which projects are worth paying attention to and what people are working on so as you go back to your digital life you can have an understanding of like oh these people are hanging out with these people these people are partnering with these people this event was really cool and there's a nice vibe going to it and so um i just love ethereum conferences in general i mean you'll catch me at every major one this year for the next couple years of my life if i have something to say about it and so just being here in person it's really important to remember our roots you know i think that ether went up a lot this past year and for a lot of people there's a you know maybe a feeling that you don't need to be as present at these things anymore but i think for me it's now more important than ever to show face and show that regardless of what happens financially that we're all here for the same reason one of everyone's favorite parts about these crypto events and crypto conferences is that there's a bunch of satellite or peripheral events that happen after the scene so uh what are you going to uh after today or tomorrow or thursday that you are really excited about i'm really stoked about the fwb party tonight we actually built at school to be able to do irl rsvps with tokengated access so basically you rsvp by holding tokens you receive a qr code and when you sign into the event it still makes sure that you're holding tokens at the event so i'm really excited about that primitive that's later tonight i'm going to be going to federal with unit swap and upshot got some awesome djs that are playing there the r ave party tomorrow night with boys noise going to be fantastic and then thursday night the ecc closing party should be a really great time yeah so cooper is the absolute embodiment of the social scene around crypto and crypto events and so take a leaf out of cooper's book when you come into crypto events plan ahead because there's so many events that you need to go to uh and if you don't plan ahead then you're going to miss them cooper uh thank you so much for coming and sharing us your ecc story pleasure to be here man i look forward to seeing the recap and everyone have a fantastic week all right everyone i'm here with simona pop from status and simona i have seen just almost at every single crypto ethereum event that i've ever been to and so i kind of want to lead with that question simona can you tell our listeners who maybe haven't been to an ethereum or crypto event what are they missing out on and maybe why should they go to one in the future hey hey thanks for having me um on the podcast and great to see each other again um i feel this is um such a great time too everybody's back together everybody's enjoying obviously paris summer in paris is wonderful but when it comes to ethereum events i feel they are so many um steps apart from your traditional crypto event i feel the atmosphere the vibe is completely different and it's an incredibly incredibly welcoming one which is why particularly for newcomers i feel ethereum events are the way to kind of try and test and kind of immerse themselves into the space because everybody's incredibly helpful everybody's incredibly you know welcoming positive and it just that's why i guess i go to all of them because it's such a wonderful time and just catching up with everybody so i've seen you at east denver and i know you've gone to devcon and all the other previous ecc events uh and you know we just came out of a over a year-long lockdown uh with covet and now we're finally getting into the world of events once again so with this uh the first ecc event out of kovid uh what are you specifically excited for with this one particular uh event i think obviously the main uh piece is the the everybody getting back together again seeing each other after such a long time um is is a mix of i guess joy a little bit of a this is so intense after not seeing uh people for for so long but i think the main um the main vibe i would say is so much has happened in this past year and a half and there's so much to celebrate going forward that i feel it's that kind of celebration that we're all back celebration for the work that we've been doing in these like stressful conditions and also you know uh the future of france and uh and everything that that brings so um just a great great um celebration i would say of ethereum of each other um so yeah very very um i don't know positive joyful vibes um i was going to ask uh oh yeah um so with all of the talks and panelists that are happening are you what are you specifically looking looking for what a panel or topic are you really excited about and uh who who uh of the panelists or the speakers are you really excited to see talk i think i really there's um should i start again um i think there's it's really as always with ecc um one of the main things that i love about it is it brings together so many different types of speakers so many different topics and it's not necessarily just the technical stuff it blends really really well with you know talks about ux and where that's heading and how we're improving and so on so i think it's a real good mix of so many different topics and so many different um i guess forecasts for 2021 and where where we're heading obviously from our side we have a workshop um that the waco team from status is assuming and it's all about um i won't say too much but maybe an integration with wallet connect and so on and how that's kind of going to again enable that better experience that much much um you know i guess setting ourselves up for that mass adoption that we're all looking for so so many things and also let's remember there's so many side events it is a busy busy agenda packed with so much so um i think obviously uh ethereum magicians are having their um uh their event as well i think it's today then there's the dow event on friday so it's just so many things but again um great things because um there are so many interesting things happening [Music] i definitely think that should be a big takeaway for the listeners who are looking to experience their first you know ethereum event is like it's not just the conference but it's a just a litany of just satellite events that happen after the fact and i'm also really excited for for those as well and people think that these things are are technical conferences about information and you know trends but it's also really really social like and i think i see you as like one of the social leaders in the in the community you're always at the events we're always talking to people um and you also mentioned the status so kind of give us the update on status and also for the listeners who might not be familiar with what status is tell us tell us what status is and why we need it in 2021 and maybe what the the future road map of status looks like absolutely and just circling back a little bit to to that social element i think it's such a great way to actually experience crypto and meet so many people and get become aware of so many of the great projects that are um that are in this space and so many people who have let's say attended conferences or hackathons remain in the ecosystem i know so many people who you know came in 2017-2018 and are now pretty big uh deals in the space so absolutely very very uh a meritocracy um kind of dynamic status-wise um it is a web3 wallet it is a chat privacy first chat censorship resistant and a web3 browser what that means is you have all of these incredibly powerful pieces in one application and because we're mobile first and this is very important from my perspective it's that accessibility for people who may not be tied to their laptops who may not have a laptop right there's so much digital access that happens via your mobile phone and i personally believe that it is incredibly incredibly important to have a powerful piece that can almost be the gateway to ethereum because it does all of the things and so with our work for instance in latin america we see this a lot because their mobile use is the predominant access uh to to digital services uh what we're working on and this is something that i'm incredibly incredibly uh passionate about is a communities feature that will essentially bring all of those three pieces into powering web3 communities and having those crypto native flows as part of the experience so as you'll know right now web3 communities exist on web 2 platforms and maybe they shouldn't so i think again having that stack and being able to provide that decentralized privacy first goodness with those crypto native flows let's just you know power those web 3 communities with with a web 3 stack obviously there's so much to consider when you are building a censorship-resistant thing and also enabling certain levels of moderation but we're on the right track and and hopefully we'll be able to share um that with everybody very soon and uh what parts about the actual status app is actually hooked into ethereum what parts of it actually touch the ethereum blockchain all of it and so like if i if i it and so it's like it's a messaging app kind of like telegram and so like how does that how does my message that i send to my friend how does that work with ethereum so with the messenger obviously um you you get it stored locally right so it is on your phone and that's also why it's such an important piece from a privacy perspective because when you join the app you will see there's no phone number there's no email we ask nothing about your personal details it you get assigned a random three word name and then you can store uh contacts locally so that i can know that it's you but i'm not divulging your identity to the rest of the network so that plays a really really important role not only from the privacy perspective but also from the uh you know from the storage perspective from where the messages get stored or how long they're stored for uh that you can we're now working on editing and deletion as well which wasn't a feature before but obviously we recognize that those are incredibly important pieces of the chat experience and so with all of those combined i think we can really achieve that level of censorship-resistant protocol but levels and tooling for moderation at community level and that very much feels like a user's private key and public address right like where you just are given the infrastructure you need without having to ask for permission right right you're just kind of using that same model but now we are extending this into like uh the more traditional app layer that people are used to uh simone it's been uh fantastic talking to you i have one last question that i think you are uniquely capable of answering as the how would you say how did you illustrate the trend of crypto events crypto events were very different in 2013 1415 and then ethereum came along in 2015 and it had its own trend or trajectory how would you say that that they've changed into what what is the arc of these crypto events what are how are they changing over time i definitely feel there's a lot more substance that we're focusing on right now and also if you look at everything that is happening even at ecc right now there's a lot of activations and there's a lot of opportunities to engage with the applications and i feel obviously we're now at a uh at a stage where there's a lot of the applications are live a lot of uh usage and so on so you are able to experience it much in a much fuller way i guess versus listening to talks and oh it's coming we have it now and there's a lot of um i mean i used to do this a lot with um you know my previous role with the bounties network do a lot of bounties for engagement and now i'm seeing people really immersing themselves in those applications in those activations really getting a taste for what it is like to literally use web3 applications now and obviously see if we need to improve the ux do this do this do this but it is a process for almost for the community by the community right and we all build together we help each other out and i think that's also a an incredibly incredibly powerful piece about ethereum is that we are all in it together right and the tide lifts all boats and all of that so it's an incredibly incredibly collaborative uh space and i'm i think we're going to see a lot more of those happening where we collaborate together projects working together to create engagements so yeah i think a lot more immersion in the future i think what i've already seen in that same vein is is we are seeing people talk about the next products rather than the first products right stani from ave comes out and says i really think uh credit delegation is like what's next for defy after he's already you know deployed eathland and then turned it into ave and already done all these other products we are now able to talk about like we already have this first generation of products that were built on what comes next and all of a sudden we go from like an industry of speculation and you know what could be into what is and what is next and i think that's really just a an illustration of the maturity of this industry that that we've come so far uh so i i'd love to give your uh perspective on that but also with uh going back to the trajectory of crypto events over time what about attendance are they getting bigger and bigger and what's attendance like over time i think one of the main things is potentially yes getting bigger but also the the piece that is most exciting for me is we're seeing more and more newcomers and this is a trend that for instance uh i've been judging each global events i think since their inception and it's a wonderful kind of way of keeping track of just how many people are coming into the ecosystem because i mean the latest one i think we had 45 were newcomers which is incredible if you look back at 2019 i think we had 10 percent so that for me is such a great signal that we are heading towards that adoption and heading towards the fact that more people are interested and they're coming to build and they're coming to you know connect and they're coming to actually potentially uh cross that bridge from web 2 and whatever it is that they're doing now to web3 and um you know the the future that we're all building together and so i think potentially getting bigger but i would say that's not necessarily the um you know the the metric that interests me is the how what is the um what's that audience profile who's coming what are they doing and you know seeing that that engagement from newcomers is perfect i think the combination of having a lot of newcomers plus a lot of products that we are already having delivered and talking about the next products that's a very different environment from like the crypto events of 2018 and 2017 where we have a lot of newcomers but it's all you know icos and speculation on the future so i i hope that these new products that we're all talking about on stages and all these panels make all these newcomers you know stickier and they stick around and hopefully we all see them at the future crypto events as well and simona i hope i see you at the future ethereum ethereum events as well and which i'm looking forward to going to all of them and i'm sure you are going to be there so simona thank you for for telling me your ecc story thank you so much and yeah let's have a great week cheers hey guys i'm here with joseph de long of the sushi swap protocol and uh joseph just had a fantastic brand new announcement uh that he debuted at here at ecc uh and so you've probably already seen it by now because this podcast coming out a few days later but joseph for people that weren't able to watch you give your presentation could you kind of give us the the elevator pitch of what sushi schwab just released sure um we released a new amm called trident and um and this um our new amm um is actually built on top of bento box our platform that allows you to have strategies on the underlying tokens and so um the tokens come in and applications like um kashi or trident which is our new amm uh on top have access to a virtual balance but um so you can kind of like do your regular swaps but underneath the actual underlying tokens are taken and exercised into a strategy um and so you get extra yield for anything that you have deposited um the so so that's like uh you have bento box which is a place where applications come and deposit assets into bento box makes those assets be able to find yield in in defy and then bento box credits a certain application with the amount is deposited right so it's kind of like a referral system in a way it goes back to the depositor it's more like um it's more similar to the banking system if you think of it like you go and you deposit your money in the bank right and then you have kind of like this balance they don't have a shoe box it says um david's money right they have they have kind of like um one big shoe box and then some of that money goes in and um and gets kind of like lent or or um invested it's very similar so your announcement actually goes even further than that so tell us a little bit more about the the further changes to the sushi swap protocol so we have four new pools um first we i think everybody anticipating that we built a concentrated liquidity pool um and that's great for like kind of um getting best prices on like blue chip assets but it's more difficult for liquidity providers um and we've kind of like built a whole new interface to make it very simple for lps to to stake and set their ranges the the next part is hybrid pools our hybrid pools are um a stable swap pool where you're able to swap like kind assets like usdct to usdc um renbtc to wbtc things that are similar that are going to hold the peg together um and those are permissionless and you can create any pool with assets of two going all the way up to 32 at different assets um uh the third pool type we we've brought back our constant product pools with a 15 gas efficiency and then a 2x like capital efficiency um because it's built on bento box um there are our fourth pool are just weighted pools so this is uh turning sushi swab more from just you know a fork off of uni swap v2 into something more of like a suite of services can you elaborate on just what do you think this means for the trend of where sushi is going it sounds like it's doing much more than what it was originally so we had had like our own like developments with kashi and bentobox and miso but we're still kind of like reliant on um you know kind of like this fork legacy code and this kind of i think symbolizes like sushi growing up as a platform and long term what you're going to see is you're going to see a platform where all these different services are integrated together and it's going to be a very uh friendly experience for uh users very cool and i think it's one of uh the the greater ethereum and d5s favorite stories to see sushi swap start as a fork of unit swap v2 and then completely blossom into something brand new uh who do you think in the like what's the average defy user that's really going to use uh these new services that you have or is this more of a product for other applications where do you think these new uh sushi swap products are really going to see traction well i think we're going to see it from the from the lps i think that um uh concentrated liquidity positions have proved themselves to give like best prices and that there are going to be active lps so we're going to try and capture some of that market um as well as like continue using there i think like each of these different pool types has like excels at a different type of um a token like for instance um concentrated equity positions are good for like d5 blue chips and getting best prices um our hybrid pools are good for um uh like stable swaps like like kind assets um like really excel on those um as and um our um constant product pools um those are good for like kind of like long tail coins and then like um our weighted pools those are also good for like long tail coins yeah so i'm definitely excited to see just what kind of the where this changes the trajectory of where sushi swap finds adoption so but i would like to turn the conversation to some more broader ecc events uh and topics of conversation what uh do you have any like topics or panels or speakers that you are really excited to hear from coming in to ecc oh uh there's that like uh geth day that they're gonna do like a rundown of death i'm definitely very interested in that we um you know coming from protocol background as well as like needing to build better infrastructure for sushi i think that like the protocol infrastructure is just not there and um we need to build something like more robust to give us like better data availability i think and uh overall like are you just stoked to be back at crypto conferences before ecc were you a big crypto conference guy and how is this ecc a little bit different than the other conferences that you've been to totally i mean like i i a lot of people like uh dump on the conferences i love them and i've always loved them um right before lockdown happened the place that i was with ecc and it felt like like in hindsight looking back like um you know like the the empire strikes back it's kind of like the end of empire strikes back and like everybody's getting covered well actually there's this like new like mystery virus everybody's like a little bit scared of everybody gets it at the conference the future of d5 is like like people like maybe recognize that but the future of d5 was uncertain at that time and now we've come you know two years and the future is very certain and um and we're back you know um and kind of like the world's recovering from this awesome joseph well thank you for coming in and sharing your announcement with us i'm sure bankless listeners will go out and find more in the preceding announcements that come out of this conference and also thank you for sharing your ecc experience thank you very much thanks for having me all right guys i'm here with jordy bylena jordy is the founder of hermes network correct yes that's right and uh jordy we are here at youth cc which i'm really excited for uh so tell me what about each cc are you really excited about yeah it's for me cc is a very very special conference uh personally it's my favorite uh it's my favorite conference for many reasons um for example here is where we start the item three project that's the the team that's doing the the the hermes and so on so we we we start together with my partners here but it's very close home i'm from barcelona i'm living right now in zug but i'm it's very close to barcelona so it's a very easy trip and [Music] you know the the paris you know i've been this weekend for example in paris and and when you walk uh in the streets of paris you start to feel very good and and and you know going to paris for this conference at least for me it's it's it's my feelings starts rising up and and very excited and especially after the after the pandemia you know i'm so happy that this to be the first the first uh conference the first um real you know real conference the conference in in place conference because you know it's this special and it's like coming back a little bit to normality i know that we are not still like full normality but at least we have a conference a real conference where with speakers with the people we miss we miss it and and and i'm absolutely excited about the about this conference and well yeah let's see how they this week this week works but uh we are also presenting a lot of new stuff we have been working a lot during this pandemia and then it's like okay let's let's just start over again let's let's let's let's let's come up again so it's very exciting yeah it's also my first time uh in paris and the energy in the city is like pretty pretty nice to feel and i also think it's pretty cool that the the crypto world the ethereum world is really one of these first industries that's really planting its flag and saying hey we're gonna do real life stuff again so i'm also really happy that the events are picking up is this your first cc or have you conned to the other ones before yeah i think i've been in all of them since the since the the beginning yeah so it's not my first cc for sure so what about this particular ecc are you particularly excited for are there any speakers or panelists that are on the agenda that you are really interested in seeing yeah i think uh personally i'm i'm i'm very interested because there are a lot of projects especially in layer 2 scalability that's the main of course there are other topics but probably if you ask me myself this is the the one that i'm more interested from we are at this point where this technology is available and we are engineering we are building these um scalability solutions so i think it's going to be very interesting to listen all the projects how they are approaching these um these these these challenges uh of scaling and bringing the blockchain technology to mainstream because this is not the only one but probably is the most difficult piece that we are missing for bringing this technology to the to mainstream so very excited to hear what other projects are doing what uh you know researchers different ideas what's coming on uh what applications they are planning and building it i think it's going to be very interesting um at least in the context of this uh scalability moment that we are living right now as we've been uh speaking on the bankless world we keep talking about layer two summer layer two summer and we we have both optimism and arbitrary launching sometime in july we just saw uniswap go live on on optimism so let's actually dive into a little bit more about the hermes network uh because that's actually something that we haven't actually talked about as much on on the bankless podcast tell us a little bit about the hermes network and and where it fits in the whole l2 ecosystem well lms network is a layer 2 roll up it's a zklr2 lab it's not an optimism it's vck right now hermes is for payments you can do any kind of payments in layer 2. it it scales a lot you know right now each each transaction controls uh 2000 transactions and in ethereum block it feeds 15 transactions so actually you know the limit would be the actual limit would be to have 2 000 transactions per second which is uh two orders of magnitude more of what's ethereum right now and this is you know this is the mainnet this is running uh we launched at mainnet on march uh the smart contract already hauled 30 million dollars at a certain point so from the security perspective we are you know we are getting this point that looks like start being safe you know that these things you can never say that something is fully safe but well it looks it looks good on on this we got a lot of experience in scaling because scaling is not only the like the engine the main technology it's also you know you need to hold a lot of transactions you need to have a huge databases you need to have explorers that holds all this information so we we got a lot of experience all the information there we are i would say that from the airmas perspective we are fully decentralized uh protocol um we are ramping up ramping map and and we need more transactions to to fully decentralize the protocol but the protocol is designed to be decentralized and we hope that slowly we are getting to uh this isn't the centralization point and we are also very excited because if you see the cost per transaction you know for the verification of the proof and so we are the the by far we are the cheapest uh uh roll up layer two solutions ck roll ups layer two solution solution uh in listing customs now the proof is very cheap and the smart contract is very optimized and we are very happy to be to be there and from here we are very excited because we are we are not stopping we are doing a lot of uh we are growing the the network and well we are here in paris we will present the the zika zika vm will be the next version of hermes where it's going to be possible to run smart contracts and transactions we are doing uh we're implementing the ethereum evm bytecode to buy code uh uh so just implementing all the bytecodes of 3mbm so you can you should be able to run any smart contract in in layer 2 in a row up and this is a project that we are working on and and fully committed we have other uh projects that we are also building like a token swap service we are building also uh instant payments decentralized manner kind of payment channels on top of player two it's gonna be important also to to have a finalities [Music] to have better finality uh times for you know for real-time projects uh we want to expand uh hms networks to many many communities many countries and start working also from the wallets and developers and different exchange and integrating it so we have a lot of work still a lot of work to do and but we are fully committed to the project and yeah that's that's all that's that's what we are doing so often there's a little bit of confusion between the difference between like a side chain and an l2 so i just want to make the bankless nation completely you know up to speed is hermes network is an l2 with zero compromises to the security and decentralization that ethereum has which is what we like when it comes to trustless technologies but uh different differentiating itself from optimistic roll-up technologies like arbitrarily optimism uh hermes is a zk roll up which has some interesting different properties uh that the the optimistic roll-up side of things don't have can you kind of just illustrate and elaborate on what those are and how that kind of changes what hermes network is yeah well a layer two solution the idea is that uh there is a transaction so it's a layer one transaction that actually packs like many many transactions so you have a state then you say okay i'm going to process 2000 transactions so you just put a new l1 transaction say look the new state well after processing all these transactions is this one and then you you just send that the difference between optimism and zika roll up is an optimism uh the coordinator just say the new estate and it can be good or or or wrong they say valid or wrong he says that the state people they have to check by themselves some way and then there is a mechanism for challenging these steps it's like okay if if the coordinator have uh an invalid state somebody can challenge that state and if he's not able to prove that this is a valid state maybe they there is some collateral that the coordinator will lose or things like that this is the idea of optimism of optimism roll ups ziki roll ups are different so you you you put the new estate but you also put a cryptographic proof that this state is valid so you don't have to worry about the the all these uh system you see this valid this is okay it's it's validated in one chain in the same smart contract uh and that's it you know that's that's that's uh end of the end of the story you don't have to white or uh be sure that this uh coordinator did something wrong and then you have like to go back and you enter to this gaming you know game theory uh ideas uh the problem of zk roll ups so the zika labs for this is much better idea you just put just put the new state and you forget about that the problem of the zika roll-ups is that you have to compute this proof and this proof is not easy to compute and you need a lot of computation resources to do that and this is the technology that actually is growing the one that we are working uh two years ago computing this proof was like crazy it was almost impossible i would say right now uh it's uh the technology has improved a lot the them even the mathematical algorithms has been improved a lot so this is being every time easier and also for example this for the zika vm you know zqbm building a zika ibm in optimism way it's i would say it's quite easy okay it's easier because you just validate the the virtual machine and that's it building that in as in a zk roll up where it's a little bit more complex because you need to build circuits that process programs and this is more complex but it's absolutely doable and you know as i told you before hermes we will present and we will explain i think quite deeply from the technical perspective how we are going to build that a little bit we are going to show the details of uh uh what are the different pieces that we put together to build these zika roll up and we will prove that that this is absolutely possible and not only that that's we are going to prove also that we can do it uh without changing the the ibm protocol without changing the ecosystem and this is the to be the new thing that we will present here in the in the sec fantastic yeah i'm really looking forward to that different construction coming out and importantly i think the the first difference i think people will experience if they were to use hermes network is that those withdrawals out of the layer two doesn't have that seven day withdrawal period that's correct right exactly yeah that's withdrawing the withdrawing thermos it's just a layer one transactions and you just withdraw and first of all one of the things that's interesting in hermes is that you have what we call it the force withdrawal so the coordinator can never lock up your your your phones you know if you want to withdraw your phones you can always have a dual layer one transactions and you will also recover the the the phones this is we're trying to follow the principles of censorship resistance and and and this is for example one of the properties uh and uh fairness and yeah it's it's immediate you know just to the withdrawal and like a normal transaction it's a little bit expensive because we need to prove that money is inside so it's a little bit expensive transaction in gas terms but not that much you know it's just you can you can recover your fonts and yeah that's it and of course it's more important that you actually have the option to do that rather than actually needing to do that having the option is important jordy when ecc is over and you go around in touring paris do you have any paris plans any sorry any uh any paris plans uh uh well i've been this week as i told you i've been this weekend already in paris so uh after the acc i'm i'm i'm i'm going back to barcelona at least in this case uh but yeah i enjoy enjoyed paris during this weekend and as i told you it's amazing you know my i charge myself a lot just being our own paris for this uh weekend and yeah hoping for the next years you know for the next year to to to continue this amazing conference well jordy thank you for stepping away for the conference for a moment and coming and talking about hermes network too at the
