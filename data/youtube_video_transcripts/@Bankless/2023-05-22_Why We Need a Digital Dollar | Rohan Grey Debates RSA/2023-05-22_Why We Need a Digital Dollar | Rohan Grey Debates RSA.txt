welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless why we need a digital dollar the question of a cbdc this is a debate that Rowan gray and I were having um over Twitter I believe via DMS a debate a conversation a back and forth that I knew at the end of this conversation we needed to convert into an episode so that is what we are doing today cbdc has been a Hot Topic Republican Front Runners are revoking their support for cbdc they see it as a threat to the United States what does this mean David has called this cbdc season two I think that's what we're in today and Rowan gray of anyone on the planet offers the most unique perspective some issues David and I disagree with him on some issues we wholeheartedly agree you're gonna have to stay tuned this episode to find out where we disagree and where Common Ground lies a few things that we covered today number one where the power structures supporting and fighting over a central bank digital currency number two why Rowan thinks the crypto Community might have to support the digital dollar or else number three why Rowan thinks we should be skeptical of anti-gensler politicians and number four we talk about the Common Ground the common cause between Rowan and the bankless nation and why we are fighting this fight David so much in this episode why was it significant to you it's very clear after having our second episode with Rowan gray that when I feel like we are kind of cut from the same cloth different ends of the cloth very different ends of the cloth but man we see eye to eye on so many issues and then as it relates to just this one thing is completely inverted so it's like it's like he's like our our cousin in some distant land some alternative Dimension that we are super aligned with but there's this one thing that we are completely backwards on so so that's uh more or less a teaser for the content at large that is kind of the theme and why we can actually talk to Rowan gray who is I would I think he would accept the labeling of a statist he's a big statist uh and but also at the same time fighting the same fight that we are fighting for the the 99 of the world and for public infrastructure that supports uh everyone else uh public money systems that allow humans to express themselves and access freedom and autonomy just we approach things from different angles so this episode starts off with us trying to understand the political chessboard that is surrounding the cbdc fight there are different factions there are different Power structures all trying to compete for a specific flavor of a cbdc and Rohan gray wants the public sector the government sector to create a certain version of a cbdc that he thinks is good and Ryan and I perhaps agree with some of his takes there not all of course uh but I think bankless listeners that have been paying attention to bank list will definitely notice some common through line some things that bankless has supported from day one that Rowan also completely supports and we have full alignment there that are just mapped on to the structures that we are building here in crypto that are also structures that you would find and in nation state governments and so understanding taking prior lessons and education from previous bankless content themes and applying them here I think will be a fun activity for The Listener yeah and of course Gotta Give the political disclaimer of course uh bankless is not a political podcast we're not supporting a political party they're Republicans or Or democrats I think Rowan gray gives some of his takes here that skew maybe towards one side and somebody listening to this might recognize that um but I I will say this he does speak very candidly and I think one thing that we're unified on is uh being anti-corruption and being pro power to the people pro-civil Liberties and that I think also comes through the episode as well David I think we got to do a debrief for this episode because I really want to talk to you about this would be a good one all right so we're doing a debrief guys a debrief is the episode after the episode you get it on the premium RSS feed if you are a citizen so upgrade to a citizenship and you can access that right now guys we're getting a to the episode with Rowan gray but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible including Kraken The Exchange we recommend for 2023.

professor at Willamette University College of Law and he's been involved in the world of politics and government as it relates to public money systems we brought him on I guess a couple of years ago my how long ago was that when we were talking about the stable act this was a stable coin bill that was being talked about in DC at the time we did an episode with him that was in December of 2020 is what I'm reading here um but I think it's time for an episode because cbdc season two seems like it is emerging at least in the political sphere so we're here to talk about that with Rowan his thoughts on what is going on I'm sure there'll be some interesting discussions some debate as there always is Rowan welcome back to bankless how you doing thanks for having me not too bad thank you okay cbdc season two here we are and uh the reason I think I'm calling it this is because you and I were dming because I was asking you if there was um uh your recommendations for a guest to come talk about uh cbdc and politics and um as we were having the conversation back and forth it was just like oh well Rowan is the guest we should definitely talk to him so that's what we're doing but some headlines I've been reading and here are a few over the past couple of months U.S senator Ted Cruz proposes cbdc ban amid growing Republican pushback headline number one number two U.S presidential hopefuls rally against Central Bank digital cash with the presidential hopefuls in question I believe it's uh REM swanny Ram Swami is that this is a a Republican Presidential nominee I believe in desantas um of course so two of them number three DeSantis legislation to protect Floridians from the cbdc so to Santa's of course using his Governor authority to protect the citizens of Florida against the cbdc This was um I don't know an executive order some legislation put forward in Florida Rowan what is going on is there a fight in DC coming over this cbdc issue yeah I mean I think there's a number of different kind of battlefields or kind of lines of this fight but certainly um as is often unfortunately the case the Republicans have have lent into defining this narrative and defining those those lines uh earlier than the Democrats and they've decided that uh they are going to be the party of of protecting people from Big Bad scary government at least that's the narrative that they're going with so um before we get in deeper in this conversation maybe we should uh disclaimed do you do you have a dog in this race do you have a side are you team R are you Team D well I'm in Australia and I can't vote so I don't really care about American policies um other than it other than it actually affects things substantively you know these these dual party structures exist around the world and you come to a different country and there's always one and kind of getting too caught up in them believing they actually mean something is is its own problem but I mean I'm certainly not a fan of the Republican party I certainly not much of a fan of the democratic party either but to the extent I think there's much politics to be done it's usually on on the blue side that said I I probably have more disgust and Scorn for your average Democratic party politician than Republican because I at least hold them to a higher standard but I do have a dog in this race which is that I helped draft the ecash ACT I'm a big supporter of public uh Financial infrastructure I support fed accounts I support a public banking infrastructure at the state and local level but in the context of new Payments Technology new monetary technology the thing that I'm most interested in is a privacy respecting anonymity respecting offline capable peer-to-peer hardware-based digital cash instrument something that can replicate the features of cash that you can use you know you go behind the schoolyard and you buy some weed or whatever else and it doesn't leave a trail it doesn't require some third party to approve it and it preserves the civil liberties that public cash has had for hundreds of years and at this point there are a small number of people who support that all blue but not representing the Orthodox party line of the Democrats and everybody else is a cop or a spook so that's that's the two that's the Battleground I care about but it doesn't neatly fall on on partisan lines and you're specifically interested in a state-sponsored version of this not a crypto Network version of this to be clear correct yeah there's two parts of that one is I think public money that is to say the thing that is legal tender usable for public Jews taxes fees fines Court judgments is the most important kind of money it's the most widely used money it's the money that is the integrated with the legal system it's the money that any entity that wants to incorporate as a business anyone that wants to live as a legally law-abiding citizen is going to have to use at some point and it is the money through which the major uh socio-political questions about privacy around Finance are going to be debated what that is to say if we lose the fight over anonymity in public money I don't think there's going to be political and legal space to preserve it in private money and we can say well we'll just build technology and dare the government to come after us and we had that conversation 2020 and I think the last couple of years have shown the government contain to come after you when it wants to and so my view is we need a mass movement of people standing up for privacy in money and the thing that they are going to think of the average person is going to think of when they think of that is cash that is to say with dead presidents on it and so what we need to do is take the fight to public money and say we need the same kinds of privacy and digital money as we have with physical money we need the same thing that cash does but digital the other reason I think it doesn't work with crypto is because it's a it's a actually a kind of technical issue which is with public money what you have is centralized issuance but decentralized payments processing so with cash you you have this question of how much should you issue to whom should you give it those are questions of public policy that question is a budget policy they're questions of macroeconomics and questions of monetary policy but once you actually inject physical cash into the economy it circulates in a decentralized peer-to-peer way right you can transact with two people offline with without any centralized intermediary now you might not like the value of the US dollar but the actual payments processing is meeting 100 of the criteria of what I consider to be privacy respecting and Anonymous offline capable peer-to-peer cash a ledger-based system doesn't let that happen because by definition you need to be connected to a ledger and the reason you're connecting to a ledger in that situation is to try to solve the double spend problem and that's why you have Bitcoin Etc but with a public currency you sold the double spend problem through the centralized issuance layer and that gives you actually more flexibility more freedom on the payments processing layer so I'm a big fan of secured Hardware over a ledger because I think that's the only way that you actually get true offline peer-to-peer capacity there's so much to unpack hero and that's why we love having you on and I'm going to let David grab the kind of the next question the transition here but I did want to make one thing clear for bankless listeners when when Rowan talks about public infrastructure he's talking about nation state not in the way that that people in crypto or David and I you've heard David and I use the term public infrastructure which I think Rowan would say that's more permissionless infrastructure it's more like anyone can use it anyone connect to it I think we have an argument that that is still public infrastructure but we'll leave that aside the definition Rowan has just used means Nation state-sponsored public infrastructure public is a word by the nation state for the nation state right um and I think bankless listeners that were um just paying attention to the Rowan's uh values in what he wants in a cbdc it makes sense as to why uh we Bank lists can't actually talk to Rowan I think we have a very large overlapping Venn diagram in our values except we just differ on this one thing which is like all right who issues it though and I think that's why this this perspective this this uh episode I think is uh uniquely interesting and why there's going to be a bunch of uh fun productivity here because I think we are both similarly cynical of the politics and uh the political games and so Rohan as we dive into this conversation uh if if your version of a cbdc came out that'd be great I'd love that version of a cbdc if that if I had to select between all the versions of the cbdcs that are out there but I'm gonna go ahead and guess that there is not consensus as to that that is the version of a cbdc that ought to exist from the power structures that be and that's what I hope to unpack here in this episode but I'm wondering if you can help kind of just like lay the landscape uh politics is a game of chess um what does that chessboard look like who are the players like how do we even like come to unders to understand the landscape that we're that we're operating inside of here yeah so I'll start with my favorite thing which is probably the least significant from that larger chessboard perspective precisely for the reason you said which is there isn't a consensus yet and I want to make a little plug which is two things first of all I'm a lefty I don't really care about nation states but I do care about public governance and to the extent that there was something larger than nation state before that too it happens to be that the nation state is the largest form of explicitly Democratic governance we've managed to build at this point um but the entity that I would start with is the treasury right when we have a you know a global financial crisis when we have some massive problem you bring up together a bunch of different government agencies you know the FDIC the the fed the OCC you know FTC whatever it is but it's usually the treasury that is leading that there's a reason Alexander Hamilton builds a tiny little white house looking entity right next to the White House and says hey if I can't ever be president I want to be treasury secretary so I think the treasury is the largest most important Financial related government agency it deals with not only you know technology and payments but also everything related to financial crime National Security the IRS Etc and if you look at the monetary history of of the United States uh the treasury was historically responsible for making paper money it was historically responsible for making coins it was historically responsible making government bonds all the most important financial instruments and then the Federal Reserve which was only created over a century after the United States was found in 1913 nowadays manages the bank account side of things but if you were talking about trying to create a cash-like instrument The Entity would be experience making cash is the treasury and ironically enough um this same mint director Philip deal in the 90s who created this statute that authorizes the platinum coin which is now also in Vogue Giving we're about to have a debt selling crisis uh he actually testified at a congressional Hearing in 1996 or seven on the future of money where he said look everything's going digital we make cash like you know instruments the coin is the most privacy respecting instrument we've ever made it doesn't even have a barcode like the uh paper money has a barcode so we should be looking at the mint to creating a digital kind of card that does that kind of thing so he was sort of 20 years ahead of this whole debate so whenever I hear the word cbdc I cringe a little bit because what is a cbdc it doesn't tell us anything about the actual instrument itself all it tells us is that it's issued by the central bank and if you listen to Central Bankers when they started talking about this stuff and I was following it maybe eight nine ten years ago early on they were trying to work out what they wanted and they would say we don't really know what design we want but we know we're going to issue it and from a political perspective Central Bankers are a very particular breed within the government they like to consider themselves highly independent most of them are trained in macroeconomics and by that I mean a very particular kind of macroeconomics most of them are statistical modelers they don't have any understanding of law they don't have any understanding of civil liberties things like that they've spent their entire life looking at data sets and spreadsheets and most of them are relatively comfortable people they're earning two hundred thousand dollars a year at the fed and they go home at 4 30 PM not like every other public servant and most of them consider themselves culturally and intellectually much more loyal to a international class of central Bankers than they do to the rest of the government so the place where you actually start if you want to understand how Central Bankers think is not the FED it's the bank of international settlements and the bank of international settlements is where they build a consensus internationally long before they ever ask an elected member of any government they go to those places they read the reports they all talk to each other and they decide this is what a kind of sophisticated technocratic consensus view is and what the central bank has come up with over that eight nine year period is a set of principles which is a rough consensus amongst them one is that it is not going to be retail they do not want to provide retail services to people that sounds like bloody socialism so they are going to do what they're going to hand it over to private intermediary Banks they are going to set up the back end wholesale infrastructure and they're going to leave the last mile to private for-profit Banks because that's how their entire infrastructure is set up today the second thing is they don't want anonymity why because they don't care about civil liberties they're all very comfortable well-off people who are by the law they don't really care about your average person who might want to deal with political dissidents or sex workers or drugs or whatever or else and so when somebody says to them hey we just got a phone call from the NSA or the FBI saying we need a back door to catch the terrorists they go sure that's fine we get it so they are that is who they have loyalty to or at least who they're willing to defer to when it comes to privacy issues and then the last point about it all is that they don't really care that much about the accessibility and inclusion elements of cash because for them anything that doesn't have four to five to six to eight zeros behind it is irrelevant it's small fry the people that deal with cash are poor communities people who don't have access to the internet people dealing with very small sums of money mostly and those kinds of people are a rounding error in their conception of the world so when we're looking to map out the internal government agencies the actors involved the starting point of the central banks and the international Central Banking consensus then you have the treasury who is more politically accountable because the treasury is directly under the president so they are concerned about the Winds of politics they're concerned about coordinating with Congress and then we get into Congress which I'm happy to talk about we can stop there if you've got more questions but there's a sort of bunch of different factions in Congress but if you're thinking about the different main actors here I would say the main actors are the treasury of fed in Congress treasury the FED in Congress okay I want to pull that apart I'm seeing two um kind of uh different parties maybe a collection of stakeholders that that you emphasize want to make sure I understand it one is kind of the the ecash lovers or the people who would actually be on the side that you articulated articulated earlier and you think that is most likely to come from treasury although I will point out it's most likely at this point to come from Congress it's from Congress it's representatives from Congress who who actually care about the public the treasury of course there are individuals within treasury who care about that but the treasury Department as a entity is is Towing the official Administration line at the Biden yeah yeah because yeah I was I was I was confused when you bring treasury into that because I think maybe some members of Treasury and maybe even leadership Janet Yellen Etc who's just recently banned uh you know tornado cash a smart contract of fact sanction list right um and certainly Janet Yellen has a has her history on kind of the central Banker uh side of the the equation as well but but in general we understand that there is this group of people of which you would call yourself one of them kind of an ecash supporter that wants to bring about digital cash cares about civil liberties cares about inclusion clears it cares about protecting privacy and anonymity and then there's another group this is the bulk of of people that we we generally um crypto at least sees the support of a central bank digital currencies you're calling these like the bis the bank of international settlement so these are the central Bankers really so we got the e-cash lovers we have the central Bankers the Central Business another group which we can call the Liberals right these are people who like public infrastructure but they don't really care that much about civil liberties they're not anarchists they're not in that bottom left side wouldn't the Liberals be in kind of the central Banker category or or mostly ah but they are a little more supportive of public infrastructure so they might be okay with postal banking they might be okay with giving someone a gov a bank account but in their view they can trust the law to protect them that's what makes them a liberal rather than in my view left us right so they would say well we'll just have a law that says don't do anything bad with the data don't violate people's rights and that'll be fine and so you have these debates with people who do want to give everyone a government bank account because they don't like private for-profit Banks they think those people are exploitative which they are but in their view the most important thing is to make it non-private is to do the equivalent of taking it away from Private health insurers and making a public health insurance right that's the biggest fight to have is to get away from corporate greed but they aren't thinking about the bad elements within the government who might actually hurt people once they get their hands on that data I feel like that group Rowan would would just kind of collapse under their being okay with the Central Bank consensus policy on cbdc so I sort of grip them under the the bis Central Banker category the difference with the bis is the bis considers itself fundamentally committed to a private public intermediary so on the Privacy thing I think they are on the same side because they're Bankers they want private Banks to kind of run things where the Liberals are okay with kind of just like naturalization yeah public option or something like that right and but on the Privacy element the other thing is I would say that the central Bankers would be the kind of people that would say well maybe it's good that we catch bad guys whereas Olympus will say no we should probably have some privacy but we'll put a law in it'll be fine so they might actually have a difference of opinion but on a policy or on a technical level they might end up at the same place so I understand those two groups but there is a group which we just kind of started this episode with which which seems to be like some Republican Front Runners that are pushing it uh back against I don't think they're pushing back against the ecash lovers they're pushing back against the central Bankers this kind of consensus bis group that we're just talking to where do they fit these people who just don't want a central bank digital currency but have not um recommended ecash as an alternative who are these people um well this is where I'm extremely cynical right and you just heard me I've got no love for the Liberals in this debate and I got no love for the technocrats in this debate but the Republicans I think are the probably most deeply cynical at all in this front because first of all the people that you mentioned 100 of those kinds of people vote for the Iraq War and the Patriot Act 100 of those people vote for being tough on crime which means the death penalty and who cares about due process and who cares about Public Funding of defense attorneys and those kinds of things right so these are people that have never met an authoritarian system of government they didn't like as long as it was punching people they don't care about but they love to consider themselves small government people which usually means less taxes and letting private property rights Trump everything right they love the idea that they get to beat their wives they get to be behind closed doors doing whatever they want they just don't want the cops telling them what to do on their own property so they call themselves small government but they love the US military they love spending huge amounts of money on surveillance machines when it suits them but it's very helpful to be a republican to claim that your anti-big government it's a very good narrative so they call themselves anti-cbdc when what they really mean is I am going to take as much money from every Private Financial lobbyist to make sure that the next generation of public infrastructure is owned and run by private actors for profit that's what they actually mean they will put up a shield of civil liberties and privacy and that will crumble the minute that there's some Law and Order uh electorate to win and what's going to be behind it as it always is is some company funding them to private ties the whole thing that's what that position is in this debate Ted Cruz doesn't give a [ __ ] about your civil liberties he gives a lot of [ __ ] concern for the people that fund his campaigns and those people say we don't want a government bank account for everybody we want to provide that infrastructure it's Square it's striped yeah you are sick you're a cynical you are more cynical than most crypto people I've run across on this part I've spent enough time at a long Republican politicians to know that when they talk about small government all they really mean is big government for Halliburton and for Blackwater I mean this is this is who they are right when when is Ted Cruz ever voted against a military budget increase he doesn't do it so let's not pretend that he's Mr small government he's just Mr anti-public goods and by public there I mean anti-goods Run for free for poor people and what we are talking about here is a bunch of people some of them in the crypto World some of them in the regular Finance world going there is a Gold Rush right now how to build a new infrastructure someone's building the telegraph line someone's building the new internet pipes right is it gonna be the US government for the public or is it going to be Bill Gates or Elon Musk or whoever else and that's who people like Tom Emma and Ted Cruz are putting a huge flashing neon sign saying I'm available for sale right by me please and I will convince these dumb hoi polloi that I care about them while I'm raking in money for you yeah the the image the choice it seems to be that it's uh which ball do you want to be kicked in because you're gonna dance and then there's a couple yeah right then there's a couple people that go hey you know what we should make this thing that should work like cash but the problem with cash is it's boring right no everybody loves cash even actual everyday Republicans most of them like cash Gods guns and cash it's a thing right but when you hear people like Tom Emma and Ted Cruz say we care about privacy where's the cash it doesn't exist it's not there on their radar I've spoken to people who are trying to get Tom ever to care about ecash he doesn't care why because all this stuff about privacy is actually about making sure that there's some private company that gets to build the infrastructure we got to get back to this Rowan because you have you considered the possibility that he thinks it's not practical or possible to do an e-cash alternative and this is where the crypto argument comes in but he went on the pilot he wanted the research to see whether it's possible so I I yeah I I get I get that that's a potential good faith way of interpreting the guy but at this point there isn't a single actual privacy respecting instrument out there now he can say he's full crypto but as I said at the beginning and we can have that technical conversation if you want crypto does not solve the problem of cash there are a third of the country doesn't have high-speed internet at home there are millions of people that do not have access to an internet connection they're still going to need some form of Lo-Fi digital cash instrument and a a ledger-based system doesn't do it Ron I don't know how um closely you've been paying attention to the crypto world as uh and our fight with uh Gary Gensler and the SEC Security's law somehow so yeah okay well yeah familiar if we win back a year in time uh the topic of conversation that we were having here at bankless is like oh uh crypto it's so bipartisan it's gonna be so great moving forward like the Democrats and the Republicans love it equally fast forward to now in the grilling of Gary Gensler uh in the last hearing that he had in front of the Senate finance committee it was very obvious that the Republicans had taken the lead here with being very pro-crypto anti-gensler and I'm wondering and and so like we talked about this me and Ryan talked about this on the podcast a handful of times like man Republicans are really stepping up to protect crypto and go after Gary Gensler now I'm wondering if we are being naive with uh support of the anti-gensler Republicans and what your take is on that yeah first of all again what is being what is being supportive of less Securities regulation it's being supportive of huge amounts of money getting to make huge amounts of money which again if you're trying to get lobbyists you know donor donor dollars that's a good position for a republican to be in Gary Gensler is Rogue I don't particularly support what Craig ketzel is doing and as a lot of people within the the Democratic party administrative structure that don't support what he's doing either why because Gary Gensler is looking after Gary Ganser at this point right he is looking to get glory for himself and for the SEC and he is doing so in a way that is not actually playing nice with the rest of the administrative agency structure and so for example when we put the stable act out what did we say about stable coins they should be regulated as a banking product and at the time that was a crazy out there position in December 2020 if you remember I got a lot of flack for being completely out there but fast forward 8 months 10 months the treasury Department releases a report on behalf of the White House saying exactly that saying that stable coins should be regulated as a banking product and I get to go well that's very nice you know but what is Gary gansell what is Gary gentzler saying Gary Gensler is saying no it's all a Securities product we don't need to work with the banking authorities we don't need to talk about it as a banking product we can do it all me and my agency a little short guy with a lot to prove with this big agency right he doesn't want to play nice with everybody and he is saying that to other Regulators right the banking Regulators people trying to put together a comprehensive piece of legislation to to divide up the different pieces of the crypto ecosystem where they should go oh this is a new banking product put it with the banking regulator this is a new security put it with security list he is saying it can all be done by Securities regulation it is an inferior way of dealing with those problems but it is a way that aggrandizes his agency and he he is explicitly not working uh as much with the rest of the democratic uh uh Administration as he should be so I think it's a very easy target to attack and there is some stuff to actually attack but again I never assume good motives with those Republican actors because they're not actually proposing anything constructive on the other side all they're proposing is let us keep making money let us keep doing whatever we want without any accountability and I know you go for probably very different opinions on this but there are a lot of things in the crypto ecosystem which meet the definition of Securities there are a lot of things in the crypto ecosystem which meet the definition of a banking product and the question becomes what are we actually going to do are we going to Simply let the inertia of technological change undermine the entire Financial regulatory regime are we going to do something about it and we aren't having those conversations now because the people in Congress are terrified of doing something and the minute a regulator like Gensler comes along and says don't worry I've got it all covered then they get to go home and not think about it again and so I think it's actually doing us a disservice as an administrative agency but I think the criticisms coming from the Republicans are not hey we should do this right it's we should do nothing and I don't like the fact that gensel is the only one doing something yeah I you know I don't know cryptos in this difficult place where we you know we're not sure which politicians will stick up for crypto civil liberties of which I think some of the civil liberties you mentioned are certainly a um part of and a subset and so we have to kind of go with whatever politician is willing to kind of resist the the bis so at some level we're kind of choosing our poison here right because I feel like if if nothing is done Rowan then uh Central Bankers kind of win I mean it seems like they have the authority they have the power they have um the politicians they have kind of the you know the The Establishment they have the structures they have the institutions and that will be the de facto it will be something rolled out akin to the Chinese essential Bank digital uh currency right and that's what we'll be left with in the United States and so the gut reaction from somebody in cryptos when you hear any politician talk about being anti-cbdc well what we hope we're hearing is they're being kind of pro um civil liberties Pro inclusion Pro some of the core values that crypto represents though I understand and I don't think people encrypt are naive enough to assume that these politicians aren't out for their own um you know political power we don't we certainly don't trust them so I acknowledge that there are there are hypocrites among them but it's like I don't throw out it's like what else what else are we supposed to do I mean like we we have to win somehow in Congress who's going to resist the the Rogue uh executive branch and Rogue Regulators who's going to resist the Central Bank digital currencies so I'm not asking maybe for for uh a solution here but it's just like what do we do about this because we're going to I feel like it's an inevitable that a you know a state-run central bank digital currency enforced by the Central Banking Community will become the standard in the US and I don't know how to resist that well so here's a good question I mean I mentioned before that they love donor money ask your average Ted Cruz or Tom M and what they think about Central Bank Independence they will defend it to the death because Central Bank Independence means that the fiscal authorities right the regular Congress budget doesn't get to make money spend a lot of money that's what the Republicans hate more than anything so what is Central Bank Independence Central Bank Independence is you can't do that you can't spend money on Health Care on education and whatever else because you cannot run deficits because the Central Bank gets to control interest rates and if you run too high deficits the central bank's going to raise interest rates and the entire Republican party is united in favor of that they don't they don't want to get rid of that maybe you're maybe your Ron Paul wants to get rid of it because he wants to replace it with the gold standard but nobody wants to say hey the Congress gets to actually spend its own money right they want to let it hand it over to technocrats because that means once again no public goods no public money when there's less public money there's more private credit and that means people go into debt that means the people who sell that make money Etc so the you know historically speaking the two groups who were supportive of Wall Street were the entire Republican party on one hand and the uh uh the Clinton machine the new Democrats right the the Robert Rubin Larry Summers Timmy Geithner all those people who are all worth a hundred million dollars and think that's makes them part of the party of the working class right that's those were the two groups High Finance Dems and and pro-business Republicans the actual group that does care about this stuff is the labor groups the people who care about black communities who use cash they're in groups in Philadelphia and New York that have organized with working-class people to pass laws requiring stores to accept cash and I I understand that from your point of view public cash Fiat is debased it's all that stuff but if I my my suggestion or my kind of pitch would be hold your nose on that for a second on the Privacy civil liberties thing the only place where we're going to win that fight in the Public's heart and mind is in the cash that they already use and the people that are standing up for that are Rashida Talib AOC even some moderates like Stephen Lynch who is from a working class community in Boston walks around talking to average people on the street when we pitched his office and we said hey it's probably bad if you can't ever make a private transaction again he went yep and we said we should probably make sure that if we're going to build another generation of public infrastructure we don't let that happen so here's the thing I think I think you find a common Ally in most crypto people who care about you know private uh civil liberties act so that's my pitch that's my that's my coming with olive branch that's a great thing okay because have an Unholy Alliance where where you support because I'll tell you what I was with one of the founders of the tornado cache the other day we got along like a house on fire I support you I support them I think I think the gov the Spooks going after the people who founded tornado cash is terrible I'm a big free software advocate so I will support that private currency but I do not think the way we are going to get the average person on the street to stand up against the Central Banking class is to convince them about okay because you have to convince them about libertarian monetary Theory and with all due respect the percentage of the population that thinks that stuff is valid is like single digits most people that's definitely public money is the way that things work so if you want privacy we we start with public mind I think I think I think the crypto Community could get around that battle for ecash in preserving civil liberties and preserving private money and also though here's what I want to make sure of though when you talk about someone like Rashida taleb or AOC or someone like that I don't know what their specific platform is with respect to cryptocurrency but I do know some leaders of the democratic party namely uh Elizabeth Warren is one that that comes to mind often are very much anti-crypto like they want to ban this stuff Rowan like so what we see is if you want to actually degrade the power of the banking class with essential Bankers right if you want to restore that power to some other power structure right we need an alternative to a Fiat only um apparatus as well so like cryptocurrency can be that alternative people can store their value in it and it does not win the The Advocates in DC who are in favor of ecash it does not win cryptocurrency Community Support when you say ecash and then let's go and let's ban crypto let's ban citizens ability to hold assets like gold or like a cryptocurrency to own their own private keys right so like I would like to see some more movement from those in DC who are on the side of ecash and on the elements of crypto that preserve civil civil liberties and anonymity to speak out about that that's like yeah yeah the equivalent of the knowledge Branch uh being passed back and forth we need this I think that's entirely fair I have spoken out against that stuff I think Elizabeth Warren now when she ran of course you know there was her and Bernie they were they looked like similar from a distance they're quite different right Elizabeth Warren was a republican most of her life her whole platform was America first which for any actual leftist is incredibly imperialist it's incredibly nationalistic in a way that I am not nationalistic and Bernie certainly wasn't in that way and in recent times it has been very pro-cop right the only people who use anonymous money are criminals this is stuff that's coming out of the Elizabeth Warren Playbook it's bad I've said it's bad publicly it is bad I'll say it right now it is in her zealousness to go after private power she is aligned with the cops that's not a good place for a progressive to be right so yes it shouldn't be to ban that stuff however the flip side of that and not to defend her because I there's no but to the criticism of her the other side of that is when she looks at the crypto Community she doesn't look at people that care about civil liberties she looks at people who she is on the other side of the aisle to like Tom Emma and Ted Cruz who the crypto Community is going these are the good guys and she says these are the most cynical pieces of [ __ ] I've ever met they do not care about civil liberties I'm the one trying to actually bring the average person's life back under their control by going after concentrated private power that these people are literally for sale to and I don't want to be told to care about civil liberties from people that don't care about anything at all right the Patriot Act Etc and so if somebody comes to her and says I care about public goods here's how we can make a public good that respects the little guy they listen to that I've had serious conversations with her office I wish they cared enough about the cash stuff but it is too hard for them to navigate right now because the minute they say that stuff it sounds like they're pro-crypto and there isn't this e-cash narrative Rowan she's declared a war on crypto that I mean that's part of her that's part of her office's message right building it right what she means what she means by crypto there isn't civil liberties right what she means by crypto is a new generation of Private Financial grift and with respect the crypto Community has not separated those two things very effectively so I I I am not defending her not being more nuanced in her critique and creating a space and saying you know what it's not tornado cash that's the enemy it's the Sam bankman Freed's and it's the Michael Sailors or whatever else she hasn't done that distinction but neither has the crypto Community I mean we are trying Rowan I mean we want the grifters out as much accounts for so much yeah it only counts as so much right there is still a thing called crypto and that word carries connotations of both so the war on crypto is the war on what most people think of in crypto which is get rich quick screams by scammers that is a war that should be fought but when we did the stable act if you remember people said oh he wants to ban this stamula I don't want to ban anything you didn't want a band die you didn't want to ban the decentralized uh staple coins all we wanted to do was regulate things that were trying to be public money trying to look like a dollar trying to be as stable as a dollar so that you use them in a way that the public couldn't even tell the difference between a regular dollar and that if you want to make a Bitcoin you want to make an ether go for your life it's not my problem it's the things that are trying to use the US dollar as its Baseline because it actually affects the US dollar right if I create a store next to McDonald's and call it McDonald's and I offer Burgers called Happy Meals and Big Macs and people get sick they're gonna blame McDonald's for that I mean I have a problem with this right it's almost a trademark issue so my problem was always the things that we're trying to walk and talk like the fiat currency if you want to make your own private currency let's see how many people use it good luck to you right yeah that's now whether that's going to impact Securities laws is a different question but frankly I think most of Securities regulation regime is is weak [ __ ] anyway the state laws back in the day when we first had Securities laws in the early 20th century were all merit-based that is to say there was an explicit acknowledgment that you should show a public purpose before you create it the federal laws that came in the 30s gave that up entirely we lost the debate before we even started what is the Securities regulation regime it's all disclosure it's like saying hey you want to shoot meth at the age of 12 just let us know we're nice parents we'll let you do whatever you want we'll buy you the smack just let us know and then the kids going I don't want to let you know and that's the debate we're having right right so I would love a debate about whether we should have a bunch of these complex Financial products whether they're actually useful but the Securities regime isn't even trying to have that debate so why should I give it any credit for it it's doing this other thing and people like Gary genslow when the time comes to do real regulation of actually important monetary products they're part of the problem too so a pox on all their houses in my opinion learning about

Luna collapse and so happy anniversary to those who celebrate I think it's a pretty a pretty um point to you sir for uh the argument that the United States dollar is a brand owned by and operated by the United States and so when private crypto monies latch on to that dollar and then can do destructive things to it understood like we've seen that uh we've seen that uh that while there are legitimate Builders building decentralized and robust products in the world there's also those but understood that there's also nefarious actors which we've like Sam Bateman freed wanted to issue a stable coin like two weeks leading up to the blow up of FTX right and Ted is somehow still alive but let's not pretend tether or binance is is the is the face that crypto wants like the hill that crypto wants to die on for its legitimacy right like this is a bad thing to be the lifeblood of the entire ecosystem and it still is right it's still the dominant trading coin it's still the main Exchange in which everything else is happening like kill kill binance and get back to me then we'll have a conversation about credibility you know what I mean kill them and let's talk you know and and that's that's I think the the narrow uh difference between your philosophy and our philosophy is like hey we would like free market experimentation blah blah blah blah blah blah but I actually want to go back out and go to the conversation of like the actual Olive Branch between the crypto people and um who actually is my first question like who is the political tribe that would be the most aligned private money cbdc uh because if we I in the ethereum world the bitcoiners are what all flavors of cbdc to Die the ethereum world ethereum culture and and and outside of the Bitcoin Maximus are more pluralistic in our acceptance of new forms of money so like I am super happy to accept a cbdc built under certain parameters and I can totally be convinced that there is a cbdc version that's out there sponsored by certain people that I could get behind in a rally to support versus others so I'm wondering if you it doesn't mean we're going to store our value in it Rowan right no no we don't have it stored in Yemen I'm not an American I don't care so I'm wondering if you could actually just like paint this picture of what this like crypto uh alignment with whom and what what would this look like how how do we uh formulate this future yeah so so first of all the ecash Act was sponsored by I think about six six legislators I was led by Rashid sleep and led by Stephen Lynch Stephen Lynch was a moderate Mercedes leaves obviously a radical Lefty um and uh I'd love to have a republican on board we try to get McHenry on board we try to get Emma on board they weren't interested right it was it wasn't substantive it wasn't that they had disagree with the provision it was that the idea of any public good was just was a non-starter for them when what they really wanted was to kill the whole thing the second thing is let's not call it a cbdc it's a digital dollar [ __ ] the cbdc's that's that's the central bank as well every time we use that world they get more power and authority take them out of it it's a digital dollar it's treasury issued but the Coalition that we're starting to form and I said this you know seven years ago and I feel really like oh my gosh it's nice that we're actually in a different world now I was like where are the Privacy Advocates where are the civil liberties groups and now we do have that group in part no you know not to kind of toot our own horn too much to my own horn but in part because the work that we did behind the scenes they have come to the table to their credit so the ACLU the Electronic Frontier Foundation fight for the future which is you know probably the one that I would suggest crypto people can come through if they want to because they're a really pretty Pro crypto um uh demand progress uh signed a and a number of other groups wrote a letter to the treasury uh wrote a letter to to the bite Administration saying any digital dollar must preserve the anonymity features of cash the ACLU is writing this stuff up right I was going to call uh with with people at the White House with those groups just a few days ago talking about this stuff and they were all making these points to to people there in the not the White House through the treasury and and the treasury's point was well do we really need this you know is this really necessary do we is there enough people that care about this you know surely we should want to be able to keep this stuff you know a surveillable you know collect data for good purposes you know and that was not the only position in treasury but that was a pretty dominant one but we had actually a whole room of civil liberties experts saying no that's not good enough uh and so those are the people I would start with right you can find it there's a website they just put together called no spycash.com right sign up for that join forces one of the big things frankly and this is one of the problems that I've I've discovered right I'm the lawyer my job is to help with the legislation the policy side is that it's actually very hard to build the technology you know it's really easy to build software when you can just spin up a server you know spin up a Linux server and start start hacking away it's a lot harder to build open source uh Hardware Open Source Hardware so getting a device where you can have a payments card right that works the way a Transit card works or something like that it's actually very difficult because most of the secured Hardware elements The Trusted executing environment elements that we actually need for this to work and typically I know they're not perfectly secure but they're secure enough in the way the cache is secure enough that if you add multiple layers and regulation Etc it will work enough we have a secret service to deal with counterfeiting Etc but to actually get a working pilot is a catch-22 because we go to Congress and we say we should have ecash and they say okay what does it look like we say well we need to build it and then like so it doesn't exist like well parts of it exists but I can show you the pieces of the elephant right but to actually get a working prototype I would say if you had two percent or one percent of the total market cap that goes into crypto going into building a Open Source White Label hardware-based Cash Card we've been an entirely different Cash Card rather than a a phone just so that it it serves the popular photos that's right you could do it in a SIM card you would want it to work with a basic phone not a smartphone but the smart the best way in my view would be to have a car that you could tap onto the back of a phone right have the chip on something that you can send out the best example was when the uh covert happened right the the cash relief that was sent to everybody at the time we said Rashida talib's office that I was working with said make it a prepaid debit card why because it's the only kind of instrument that's actually going to get to the vast majority of people if you're undocumented you don't have a tax form if you're homeless you don't have an address to if you don't earn income you don't have a tax filing right if you are dealing with an abusive spouse you don't have your own bank account so they the first round of checks they did it mostly through bank accounts the second round they switched over and did mostly through prepaid cards but the prepaid card could be generic you could load any kind of value on it could be for crypto as well it could be for any private localized currency it could be a complimentary currency at the state level at the local level Detroit used to issue paper dollars in the depression so you create the generic white label card and all you need is to upload some sort of value onto it that's why I'm saying if you separate the issuance question from the payments question most blockchain based systems or mining based systems and things are trying to solve those two problems at the same time the monetary policy question and the payments processing question focus on the payments processing leave the monetary one for a separate day and have a card where the two cards can transact value directly peer-to-peer uh groups like whisperkasha doing this yeah this is why I think that um that really your initiatives around do need uh and do benefit from some crypto allies because we're building a lot of this infrastructure you know the public private Keys okay okay so so there this is the case for crypto and it's like uh to you I'd like to make and I and I'm wondering what you think about this right so there's two points I'd make one is we're sort of building the infrastructure you talked about it's like so if you have a you know ecash for example or digital dollar it's a bearer instrument right so you get into these troubles of let's say you issue a card and someone loses it well then how does it get refilled I like all of these problems I mean this is what crypto is actively solving through like smart contracts for instance where you can have you know a social group of of people helping to restore uh your crypto should you lose it like we're building some of that infrastructure here and I feel like there's um there's a link there but but I guess I would make the point to you Rowan that's like you going to Congress and you're talking about the digital dollar and ecap cash and you don't have the product built right I know crypto doesn't have adoption but it does have some of the product built so right that's a benefit the second thing yeah okay sorry the second thing I want to say here though is that probably the more pernicious thing or the thing I worry about most about your ecash initiative because I think most of the crypto Community who are not the same begman Freeds and the dokons will get on board and would be support very supportive of digital dollar ecash type initiatives doesn't mean we're going to store our value in this thing but like the same values you talk about privacy and anonymity we just don't think that the treasury is going to allow you to do this we don't think the nation state is going to actually allow you to do this look the Banning of tornado cash I mean that came through treasury ofac sanctions uh my colleague David um you know is actually on a lawsuit against Janet Yellen and treasury because he was a user of tornado cash he received some um uh you know a hacker not a hacker but uh somebody sent proceeds from tornado cash to one of his ethereum addresses and so he somehow maybe implicated in this kind of like ofac legislation so we're actually using the court system to push privacy uh you know that via that method how can we trust these people my like my argument hero and it's like we have to build this we we need we actually have to build this and try it and push it through we're not going to get it top down because they don't want this the surveillance state does not want this so we're while we're very supportive of your initiative in general and we encourage it we think it's good and let's give it let's give it a good old College try that sounds great we're also not going to put all our eggs in that basket and you understand why we have to have a a backup and that for the for us that is crypto what would you say to this yeah look I think this is this is a productive place to be I think this is a productive space these two questions the first question I actually disagree I don't think you're building this spec because when I look for this spec it is an outfit and I think that the reason it's not out there is because as I just said you're trying to solve two problems at once which is to say you're trying to solve decentralized monetary issuance and decentralized payments and you're trying to solve it with the same Tech and so where you end up with is everything has to be online everything has to settle online with a ledger because it's only Through The Ledger that you can have some sort of decentralized consensus preventing the double spend and the issuance from being problematic but if you have a centralized issuance you can have offline capacity as long as you have a hardware secure element so I don't actually think that there's much many people in the crypto ecosystem working to that spec if there was if it was even five percent if it was even five to ninety five as a ratio I'd probably be okay but it's like zero to a hundred everybody's working on decentralized Ledges or distributed Ledger Tech and offline Hardware capability is just DOA so that's a really big problem for me is that I don't think the spec is there and then on the second point I I do have a deep skepticism I don't think you trust them I don't think you asked permission I think you have to build power but you need to build power to the point where there is a mass movement in the streets right when's the last time there was actually a serious group of people that wouldn't let the government spy on them it was the people that remember World War II as the people that were getting tortured because their friends and family members were being dragged out of their beds at night and they remember right that's the kind of mass movement that we actually need but again what is the crypto ecosystem saying the crypto ecosystem is saying you have to believe in billionaire grift you have to believe in libertarian monetary Theory and you have to believe in a complete nihilism about the state which means not just money but Health Care public education roads schools the kinds of stuff normies actually like [ __ ] all that stuff it's either wrong I would actually describe that to a narrower more extreme parts of crypto that I actually don't care to scale out in this life but maybe the loudest to Rowan's points right right but there is there isn't a group of crypto people going we believe the government can provide good Public Schools we just don't trust them with the money right that isn't a crypto narrative I've ever heard right we definitely don't do the whole like same Services as the government but there is a very strong cohort of people that are here to build public goods that are net new new public goods new public goods funding for things that have not been funded by this stage that is actually a very free and it's usually yeah not for free and there's usually some guy gets filthy rich in the provision of that service how many crypto people are running a public sector salary I mean I'll tell you my salary right now and we can go side for sale if you want but like I I don't I don't think that we're talking about we're talking about people for whom this is an entrepreneurial capitalist Venture first and foremost and that I think is not the same as the spirit of a public service right the people who are pushing for Medicare for all are not seeing themselves making millions of dollars on that ecosystem the people who are pushing crypto are and that's the that's the thing that we don't turn the volume up on that but that's always in the background that's why you do this stuff right because eventually you get to stop being a temporary embalance embarrassed billionaire and you get to be the billionaire that actually saved the world but I think you know when it comes to when it comes to uh what you're trying to uh ask permission for or what you trust the state about my view is I very much agree with you I think the odds of winning on this are extremely slim like like less than a percent right but and this is maybe what the last couple of years have have you know hopefully maybe half a point to me I appreciate you giving me a point earlier and and point to you which is you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket but if the state crushes cash Fiat cash it's sure as hell gonna Crush crypto's privacy you're not going to win a court battle to say you know what you don't get any privacy in public money but we'll let you have it in in so you're saying if we don't win the battle for digital dollar and e-cash privacy basically we become an underground group of Renegades or we don't have a privacy on our chains that's basically illegal to use tornado cash as all right let me remind you for Americans listening to this it currently is exactly because we the hearts and Minds debate is not about public versus private instruments it's should we be able to make an anonymous transaction if we should of course the public should allow us to do it with the Public's money if we shouldn't why would we let it do it with private money then Ryan one comment on this I think that in your battle in your framing for ecash in the digital dollar I think one way to frame this to the crypto Community is you are fighting for um private forms of cash and that could include tornado cash something like Z cash any crypto native element and also the digital dollar if the tent was widened a bit I think you'd find more uh support from from crypto and maybe that's part of the reframing that that you're kind of doing for us today yeah absolutely and this is why people like meeting people like Amin solmani from from tornado cash and talking to them about this stuff is so important because I did not expect a mean until Monty's name to get done I had a great weekend with him and important the other day but this is this is this is part of why but my view is that the public conversation is the one that hits 98 of the population right like I understand you're deep in the crypto you're deep in the kind of like corner of the corner of the corner of The Cutting Edge right but for the average person they are still trying to work out how to use their bank account right they are more interested in the two thousand dollar check they got from the government and whether or not that has interchange fees on it and whether or not they can spend that money on sex toys and drugs or not right that's the actual cash that they're thinking about when they think about cash New York City and Philadelphia even while the Attorney General New York's putting crypto regulation out there and going after stable coins is passing laws forcing cities to let them use cash like that is the thing when we talk about cash that most people think of they don't think of some online Bitcoin you know derivative like zcash and part of that is because to go back to point one it's not actually the same something that requires online settlement is not cash in my opinion it's a bank account and it's good zcash is trying to Shield Bank transactions that's great it's trying to distribute a bank across multiple entities that's great but what you are offering is fundamentally an account it's not a bearer instrument that I can hand to somebody else it's a ledger that I have to move money around on a ledger it's not cash right so yeah I think you're making the case here and I like the case and I think we've reached a point and I'm hopeful um bankless listeners and and people in crypto Community who are hearing you are hearing the Common Ground here and I think the the point made is like cash itself just actual physical cash is is an original form of bankless money it's nice and it's not an IOU in a Wells Fargo account it's not traced and tracked by all of the various side chains of JP Morgan Silicon Valley Bank and the surveillance state it is appear to appear bankless money system and if the journey to going bankless is basically we want to become more bankless over time those in the crypto Community who support that journey and that mission and I would include myself as one and David and The Wider bankless Community should be supportive of an e-cash okay so we got that ruin but I have to ask the question okay here this is where we might depart a little bit which is tell me about the central banks though all right so bankless money we've got commercial bankless money it's peer-to-peer physical cash and the digital instantiation of that and crypto provides some of that and what you're proposing uh provides some of that too we haven't solved the senior age problem we haven't solved the problem of like irresponsible Central Bankers another layer of bankers at the root of this who can do whatever they want with citizens store value assets with their money system right and that's and that's a piece that you talk about being supportive of you know democracy and that sort of thing is the most scalable you know voice of the people type of infrastructure what about free markets as well like where where does that come into the picture and I understand that there are flaws with free markets and externalities and you know Capital pooling all of these things so I'm not a you know naive to that but I would say is this is the people voting if they're saying hey dollars degrade over time they're worth a lot less this year than they were five years ago and you call this a savings account that's laughable I'm losing money every year and they choose individuals of their own volition to exit that system and go to another system maybe crypto maybe some other store of value that seems pretty Democratic to me it doesn't use one person one vote which is important in a democracy free markets were essential in the founding of uh democracies as well and this seems like a free market reaction to this I don't like that money so I go choose this money what in the past you've been much more kind of anti-crypton as a store of value in this conversation you're sort of saying well let it live its own life it's fine just we're not I don't want to ban just leave it to the side but but tell me what's what's your problem or do you have a problem with this argument how do we solve the problem of central Bankers inflating away all of our our uh currency okay so I've got one little reframe in my own story as a kind of Old Branch to you first and I'll try and answer questions so that is um right now the paper cache right the paper coins anyone can make a a wooden coin or whatever else but paper cash is issued by one company that's been doing it for like a century that makes you know some nice stable profits in Virginia no one talks about it no one knows about it right it's like some family that's been running this company they're actually minting the coins like them yeah the people who are making the kind of cotton that goes into the dollar bill right it's like there's one contract that the government's had for a very long time right that's a closed Source version of paper money what I'm talking about with the ecash what we put in the ecash Act was make it open source make it open Hardware make it generic white label which means anyone from a local community Through to a private company could take that technology and make their own version of ecash with their own value put into it so I would love to break the Monopoly over the paper money itself that doesn't mean everyone can put the US Dollar on it and call it a US dollar but it does mean that you could make an ether paper currency or a Bitcoin currency or whatever digital cash instrument right so I would love to break the Stranglehold over cash as technology and and and not not have it only a government thing when we talk about having a government cash instrument or having a public bank account Central Bankers hate it for the not to do with privacy they don't give a [ __ ] about privacy they just give that to the Spooks they say whatever you want that's fine what they actually lose sleep over at night is the idea that people will take their money out of bank accounts and put it into even a central bank account so when progressives even these are the Liz Warrens of the world say we want to give everyone a Federal Reserve account the Central Bank hates it because it would mean all the deposits would flow out of the banking system and flow into individual accounts they would store it like it was Cash in a vault what does that mean for the banking system it would have a huge liquidity dream right suddenly Banks would be having huge outflows it would be like a bank run like we just saw with Silicon Valley Bank how is that going to be dealt with the central bank would have to provide them that funding directly like it just did what that means is the central bank's balance sheet explodes the central bank is lending billions of dollars there are no individual human depositors serving as that liquidity and the central bank would have to own and be very explicit about the fact that every time a bank makes a loan it is channeling public money the central bank is behind the scenes lending the bank the money to lend to the person that is the closest thing to Soviet communism with God in the United States right it is the closest thing to a public system of credit allocation that we would that we have so if we have a system of government cash or digital cash accounts or a 100 insured government account what you are doing is separating the whole issue of money and payments from the question of private credit supported by the state that system may have a role it may be drastically smaller than it currently is but at the moment whenever we talk about inflation from too much demand which for the record is only one source of loss of purchasing there are other sources including poor management of the economy so I think one of the ways to ensure the value of the dollar is good is to actually invest in good public infrastructure is to stop underfunding the roads and the hospitals and the schools so that we actually have a robust economy to build stuff and then the dollar is strong but a lot of the people who are so afraid of debasing the dollar are the kinds of people that oppose public investment because they think any new dollar created must be inherently bad or inherently devaluing whereas in fact if you invest in productivity enhancing things it can be good for the dollar it's just a question of whether you think the government can ever do that or it's always going to get stuff wrong which is much more about that libertarian kind of you know liberal Lefty divide but to your point I think I have no problem with people storing value in other things store it in beanie babies for all I care right create it create ether for all I care go for it and if that ends up becoming so big that people want to leave the US dollar the US dollar lost its own gain right it had all home court advantages and it still lost fine I am deeply skeptical of that for two reasons one I think the US dollar is still by a long shot the most useful thing that you can store your money in because the biggest thing in my experience is liability risk it's not the ability to buy coffee it's not the ability to store value and see its number tick up it's when [ __ ] goes wrong can you use this thing to get out of the problem whether it's jail whether it's a lawsuit whether it's the plumbing in my basement that just exploded right the plumber is not accepting crypto the dollar is always the thing that is most widely accepted because the legal system is everywhere right legal liability risk you walk down the street someone hits you with your car you hit them with your car it's the dollar that the court is going to put that court judgment in what if it wasn't a dollar if it was something else whatever the court forces that's what most people are most worried about but to your point about free markets and this maybe goes back to that earlier point that original thing about public versus permissionless I use the word open and for those interested I had a long conversation with Peter van volkenberg at coin Center who shout out to them they have been pretty supportive of ecash Jerry Brito wrote some of the best articles about digital cash um uh I had a long conversation on their podcast about the difference in public and open with him we had a kind of good faith difference and opinion there um a free market is predicated on property rights it's predicated on someone enforcing your property rights right even if you've got a stick somewhere the reason that I can't send people in to take that stick is because there's a police force right unless you're Murray rothbard uh even Milton Friedman says you need a police force right and you need contractual enforcement so a free market still has a state in it and the question is you know how big do you want that state do you want that state to do only courts and police or do you want to do courts police plus schools and health care and then you're back to just the same state that we're talking about so when I hear free market what I think of is layers and layers of legal institutions that are necessary to make that work and I I like smart contracts as software I don't think they're contracts because if I have a dispute about a smart contract I take you to court so I I when I think of a free market yeah this is this is kind of I I I would love to go back and listen to kind of you versus Peter on kind of the question of uh open versus public but we you know one one return one thing I'd say is there there is a form of property right and settlement assurances that a network like Bitcoin or ethereum actually provide right which is just basically if the code kind of settles the transaction then it's settled and they do this without guns or police or you know a legal system this is kind of uh part of it as well um I I guess about a different conception of property rights then because for that to work you have to have a server which has to be in a place somebody can't take that server there has to be electricity being provided and that electricity can't be taken away that person who's holding that can't be put in jail right that person can't be put on the death penalty and killed so you have to have a property right in your body that's protected you have to have a habeas corpus right a sixth amendment right and all that kind of stuff so I I you can move things around on a ledger but I don't think that's the same as a property right because a property right is you can move things around on a ledger and nobody gets to stop you but you could try to move things around on a ledger and ofac is going to come and do what it does you don't have a property right in there I I do think what I what I will say is I do think that um some people in crypto forget about sort of the power of violence and and protection kind of the meats-based layer and sort of the the French attack and you want your local police force you know making it such that um burglars can't come into your house and wrench attack you and beat you for your you know 12 word seed phrase right and you very much want that and you'd very much value that on the other hand I will speak to death we'll just beat you to death sure on the other hand I will say in kind of defensive cut the you know the crypto as a as and using ethereum or something like this as a property rights layer um there is a layer of privacy anonymity that you have the ability to kind of transport money value inside of your head just with this this uh seed phrase the ability to kind of settle that on chain that is something if you're saying it's not full private like uh property rights it is something there must be like layers of property rights that we're actually talking about here and I'm not discounting the value of kind of like at the the base settlement layer yes there's kind of violence and you know secured by nation state protective but there is something that that crypto is providing in the digital that is uniquely different here and I guess if you're not going to call that uh um property rights I don't know what you'd call that I I think I think what we are talking I mean first of all when when I say there's a state involved in property rights it's not 100 zero thing right like you can't right now the state can say you can't speed but that doesn't mean that it can stop me speeding at two in the morning on a deserted street right but it does mean if everybody is speeding all the time the state can do something about that right so there is there is this idea that you don't need perfect enforcement for it still to be something the state has influence over so when you say a seed phrase and that's it it's not that's it right it's electricity it's boxes it's chips it's all those other things right you need to trust that the Intel chip that that AWS server running your you know running your client is not compromised with some code in there right you need to be able to inspect that code you need to make sure that there's silicon being shipped from wherever to make that chip right so meet space is always the fundamental layup even of conceptual space and I care enough about the internet and the internet infrastructure to think about what it actually means to regulate that stuff right to regulate the cables to regulate the Telecommunications Spectrum right if you can't send signals because I put you in a faraday cage underground then it doesn't matter if you know the seed phrase that seed phrase is useless right that's what Guantanamo Bay represents it and that's where ofac will take you right eventually so you can have a seed phrase in the woods and it doesn't help you change the blockchain right so that I I think starting with the idea that you you need to take the full stack right you need to take account the full stack you want a property right a property right is that full stack is on my side at every point in the stack I am protected and if you are not then yeah you've got your seed phrase that changes the power calculus but it doesn't actually get you all the way to being protected and that was kind of you know when we had this first conversation two three years ago I was like they can come at you right like around the world it's like you've got 50 000 nodes that's really cute do you know how many gorilla movements the United States has crushed that had a million people in it like they in Indonesia they killed three million Communists in one day I'm sorry in one weekend like you need a lot more nodes than that to be outside of the power of the state if it decides it doesn't value what you're doing and that's to me what the big fight over the cash is is we have 300 million people in the United States we probably need 100 million of them supporting physical cash in the streets before we are going to have a chance to go up against the cops and the Spooks because what it's known to show us they lie to Congress to their face and everyone was just like meh like it's it's pretty bad right it's gonna take probably some genocide before everybody remembers that their grandparents fought for this stuff and I don't think knowing the password in your head is going to be good enough and if it was we wouldn't I mean tornado cash would be in a different place like when I spoke to me like what they're doing with tornado cash version two is they're trying to compromise the treasury they're whitelisting certain accounts in North Korea you know doing all this stuff precisely so they don't find themselves being arrested in the middle of the night so I I agree with you that it is something I just don't think it's enough and I know it would be really great if it was enough but it isn't I think that's a harsh truth I think we have to like eat at some point uh Rowan I think bankless listeners uh can see why we're excited to have you on because uh this conversation I think is just uh intellectually curious at the deepest level and it goes down to the very root of like what makes social structures and social systems and so I think that's why like Ryan and I find these conversations very compelling and I think also why you were able to find uh camaraderie in people like Amin solimani and the coin Center guys and and us here as well and so I want to while we could have this debate for hours probably and we probably will at a future point in time because we enjoy these conversations like I do want to zoom back out and remind The Listener and all of us who the real enemy is and so what I'm worried about is that your version of a digital dollar along with our version of a private crypto money that's inside of the internet both offend the powers that be and the powers that be are the ones that have Wall Street and other power structures behind them so I'm wondering how we can pivot this conversation and what we need to know about when because that that is also the fight right if the if the totalitarian cbdc comes on the scene and is Brute Force down everyone's throats I'll take your point that crypto's not going to do well in that industry we will need crypto more than ever but the legality of crypto will also be in questioned more than ever and so how do how do you have any advice for us as as crypto people as to how to fight this fight yeah Overton window goes in the direction that we want how do we win I I think I think we need to come to some consensus on the spec on what we actually need to build and I think like and I I don't have the only answer on this but I think I think we need like my view and I'm open to being convinced otherwise my view is it needs to be offline capable and that means it needs to capable of finals settlement offline not just xiaomi and e-cash where it then settles back on a ledger a week later or something it needs to be final settlement offline which means to me it needs to be Hardware secured so I think we need to have some consensus that as a spec goal for the ecosystem like you've done a fair bit on chain right you've done a fair bit on Ledger we need to do off-ledger we need to have no Ledger for a while like we need to work out what that Tech looks like and work out how to put infrastructure into that in a really serious like resources into that in a serious way because I I completely agree with what you were saying earlier Ryan we need that technology the proof of concept at the very least before even the people in Congress right the imagination Gap is huge right now and we need some way of being able to switch code to your point I am not saying everyone in crypto needs to love the state like loves Fiat [ __ ] for you fine do it but make that white label cash instrument use it for your own stuff and just make an open source and then I will take it to Congress right but like let's let's find that instrument that we need to build that could have any value put into it and let's build that thing and then we can go to Congress and say this is what your money should look like and then you can say they'll never do it we're going to make on our own great like that will be the first stable coin I will support 100 when you make a cash stable coin and then you say hey there's a hundred like thousand dollars in a vault somewhere and we're making this Cash Card let's do it but at this point that's my biggest concern is I don't have the technology on me I don't have the developer Army because it requires not just some good coders it requires like a factory making chips you know like I follow Raj Bhai follow pine64 I follow you know beaglebone I follow all these small board computer manufacturers trying to develop some Open Source Hardware but when we get to point-of-sale devices when we get to trusted executing environments it's it's the stack is always completely closed at this point there's layer after layer of proprietary Tech even the best digital cash Tech I found which was whisper cash 85 of what they're using is proprietary so I we need an Open Source Hardware like Smooth like yesterday in that stuff that's probably the first point of consensus and the other one is I think like a being skeptical of the Top members of the world or if you don't want to be skeptical of them appeal to their better nature appeal to the version of them that you believe they are and say hey Tom Emma support ecash and see what he says and if he says it can't be done say will you support us trying to do it then and if he still says no Then start to be a little suspicious but push him to it right hold him to it if if there's team red out there convincing those people because if we had the the state Skeptics on the right and the state Skeptics on the left uniting in this stuff nobody could claim that was a crypto grift nobody is going to claim Rashida Talib is in the pocket of crypto you will have instant credibility on that front right Elizabeth Warren is not going to say I'm sitting my crypto Army against the squad so find whatever that point of commonality is around protecting the little guy leave the libertarian debate over debasing the money for a different day right in the same way as the people who come together and form a constitution the most important thing in that room is what you don't talk about because you know if you start talking about it you'll blow up the consensus so leave the debate over monetary issuance to another day we can have a gold bug versus soft money debate any day let's work on the payments Tech together and get something that actually can be uncensorable but not online Rowan it was a pleasure I think you've left the bankless community with some next steps that was definitely a call to builders um and on the social layer I can say we will support all bankless cash initiatives that preserve civil liberties and uh privacy and so you've got us there if we're going to raise a 100 million people in the United States who care about this I think one route for you to consider Rowan is uh the crypto Community um there's a lot of us know we're growing and uh hopefully we can um you know make sure that entire Community cares about these values we've been talking about today as you do we appreciate your time today thank you so much thanks for having me it was a real pleasure wow action items for you you know what you guys can go down memory lane and go listen to The Original Episode we did with Rowan gray around the stable act which was his legislation at the time that would be uh pretty fun to see that Evolution here that's all I got though um maybe I should leave out uh lead out with this risk and disclaimers of course crypto is risky you could lose what you put in none of this was Financial advice never is on Bank list but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot thank you
