[Music] hello everyone happy friday morning welcome to the fourth week of january david how are you doing today i am fired up today we have a lot of things to talk about so much news uh we are going to do something a little bit different in this episode uh i know a lot of people including myself want to talk and hear about gamestop and all of that just that massive amounts of news there's so much to talk about there's so much to peel back what we are doing in this particular weekly rollups we are putting the the very last section the section that about what david and ryan are excited about that is going to be we're only going to talk about gamestop uh we're gonna talk about gamestop for like 20 minutes and the reason why we're doing that is so that we can go through the weekly rollups as we usually do it and we don't have to bother about touching gamestop because we're going to touch up on all of the game soft topics at the very end it's going to be a normal weekly roll up up until that point and it's going to be our normal pg weekly rollup up until that point but like i said i am fired up so if you've got kids in the car uh if you listen with your kids around uh maybe just listen to the gamestop section of this episode at a different time because there might be some swear words there you go things are going to get kind of spicy kind of weird near the end of this weekly roll up but david let's get started with the typical we always start with market what is going on in the market should we talk about bitcoin yeah yeah bitcoin is hanging around in the low 30 thousands range ranging between it actually got below 30 000 a couple times in the last week but didn't stay there for very long kind of staying within thirty to thirty four thousand dollars consolidating at what is still a relatively high price pretty still for uh pretty far off of its all-time high of forty two thousand dollars but doing a good job maintaining that thirty thousand dollar floor when there's a dip people always question they always ask well are we going back to uh all-time high below all-time high do you have any takes on that or you just kind of wait and see yeah i think bitcoin at this point is growing a pretty strong allergy to anything in the 20 000 range i think we could flirt with it a few more times uh i don't think i think bitcoin is actually going to be relatively quiet for perhaps even all of q1 um i think we're gonna find thirty thousand dollar bitcoin to be an extremely comfortable number okay well let's talk about some other numbers eth price we hit a new all-time high time we just say that yeah last week we just said that i think i think we're three weeks in a row of east all-time highs first it was 1440 then it was like 14 like 60 and then it was 14 like 90. uh still having resistance around the 1400 level yeah well let's uh let's see if we can continue that trend david i'm kind of liking this all-time high next week too what about d5 what's going on there is it d5 season yet oh i think i think it could be things are really heating up with d5 tokens the dpi index uh the the token that that tracks all of d5 well most of d5 the top 10 defy assets is at an all-time high of 291 dollars as well as the value locked in d5 is at an all-time high of 26 and a half billion dollars defy doing really really well well let's talk about d5 versus ether because we we always approach sort of uh bitcoin uh but also ether as kind of a reserve asset ether is the reserve asset for the ethereum economy which means if you're buying defy tokens you better be making more value in ether with your investments or else you're better off just holding ether right so that's why you you're bringing this uh metric into the into the fray here i've got a join for free button on trading view i'm not going to join today david is that okay no not today okay just just refresh that page and that'll go away all right refresh the page but what is this um ratio that we're looking at yeah so we are looking at the us or the eth dollar the eth price of dpi so dpi denominated in east terms and that tells us a very different story than the dpi price in dollar terms you know the dollar is the dollar but ether is really the reserve asset of ethereum and what we are seeing is that back in we had we had d5 somewhere where very uh basically all the d5 tokens were you know pretty inflated in price and then we had the d5 like quote unquote three month bear market at the bottom it bottomed out in november and then it bottomed again really in january versus eve but you know since uh since like early nov early november 2020 to where we are now defy tokens have been in a channel verse eth that it is starting to poke up against the upper bounds of that channel and i think the reason why it's important to pay attention to defy tokens versus eth and dpi versus eth is that it's defy season quote-unquote alt-season which i totally think is coming which we've been talking about on the weekly rollups for a while i think that that happens when these defy tokens break out of this channel verse ether which they have been outperformed they've been outperforming uh ether for basically all of 2021 and all we need to have happen is for that trend to continue for us to get into defy season i i think defy season's right around the corner and the dpi eath chart has that story being told oh david i don't know though uh is pretty strong these days too so what happens if eth goes on a tear bust through the the 2k mark and leaves defy in the dust is that a possibility as well yeah i think that's totally a possibility and uh like like i said i think in d5 tokens and that in that possibility will outperform the dollar very very strongly because they track ether but you're totally right versus ether they could fall there is room for for ether to just do something stupid after it breaks this all-time high like we saw bitcoin did you know bitcoin broke its all-time high and then doubled it you know ether has broken its all-time high twice now uh but you know has really been kind of scared to get into price discovery mode i think the the time where ether breaks all-time high and goes into price discovery price discovery mode i think that's a possibility um i'm hoping that that happens that would be awesome um and that would definitely uh kick the can down the road for defy tokens versus ether and defy season if ether comes to dominate the the landscape uh d5 tokens will have to take a back seat um but i think defy season is coming inevitably one way or another this is why we talk about the crypto money portfolio the bankless portfolio being a a healthy dose of bit of crypto monies at the bottom so these are ether these are these are bitcoin this is sort of what you denominate your wealth in in the crypto economy and you purchase some things like defy tokens and those assets if they're if you think they're going to outperform eth and and bitcoin right in order for them to be good investments they they must but if you have that kind of a portfolio you can't lose in this kind of a bull market um of course never know what could happen in the future but things are going up at the moment david uh i i just said things are going up at the moment at the same time bitcoin has had like you know two weeks maybe three weeks or so of somewhat of a correction right um but these corrections are normal uh aren't they like this is so this is a chart of 2017 what's happening in 2017 here that is relevant for us in 2021 yeah this chart shows the four quarters of 2017 and it shows multiple 20 to 40 percent retracements of the bitcoin price as it climbed up that uh 2017 parabola we've talked about this before on weekly rollups we're talking about it again 20 to 40 drawbacks are the norm in bull markets you know bull markets are fun times because everyone's making money but that does not mean that pain is not felt in in bull markets we there is always pain ahead of us even if you've just felt pain there's pain ahead still that's how bull markets work uh it is not smooth sailing so there's always a looming 20 to 40 correction on the horizon so that's the message here the other message thing yeah the other message is of course that these these corrections these pullbacks if you will are normal in in bull markets we we've seen this play out already there's about one every quarter that happens with bitcoin this is what happened in 2017 and the average pullback is about 30 david's right on between you know 20 and 40 percent would be somewhat normal so keep that in mind during the bull run if there's a correction doesn't mean necessarily that it's over ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of d5 so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defy is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today david that's market let's get to releases so ev2 is available on bitfinix and we're talking about the eth2 asset staked eth really is what we're talking about here what is what does that mean yeah so bitfinex is offering a state eth derivative token and so what that means is that they are accepting each deposits from their users and then they are issuing a token which is a claim on those deposits this is actually how just banks work right like you give them the money and then the banks will give you a receipt like a receipt of deposit a credit of deposit um and this is what bitfinex is doing they are receiving ether deposits issue a token that is a credit on your deposits and then that token is um well and then they are allowing for that token to be traded uh it looks like on their platform so i don't think it's something that you can withdraw it's basically they are allowing second a secondary market to happen inside of their exchange all the crypto banks are doing this guys so kraken is has amassed a pretty large amount of beef steak to eat a coin base is going to be doing it at some point soon i'm looking to that release david this is not necessarily a bad thing but it's also not necessarily a great thing what we prefer is for people to stake at home on their own validators uh and barring that we'd prefer that they use a decentralized staking as a service provider can you talk about that that second option yeah so for any centralized product that this world experiences the theory behind ethereum is that if there is a centralized product we can make a decentralized correlate to that product using ethereum's app layer one of the centralized products that i think will come first to ethereum's app layer and create a decentralized version of this is staking it would be pretty terrible if things like bitfinex and coinbase and all these other centralized exchanges were the main staking entities behind the ethereum network and so let's let's create an application that decentralizes this service where you know people can contribute the resources that they have maybe it's ether maybe it's a validating node depending on what you have you can come to this theoretical decentralized staking as a service application and then deposit the resources that you have in order to create a a self-sovereign staking system we just wrote about this in the bank list newsletter i put an article in there talking about the thesis and theory behind decentralized staking platforms and i use rocket pool as the example the exemplar example of what a decentralized staking as a service application can do in the same way that you know it's really great that we have usdc on ethereum even though it's a centralized stable coin it's a banked stable coin that's totally fine there's more options for us it's really important that we also have dye and in that same vein it's in we are going to see centralized versions of staked ether derivative tokens come into ethereum and it's going to be really important that we have a decentralized derivative staked ether token and that coming out of rocket pool is our eth i think there's going to be a very fun battle ahead of us uh as centralized protocols and decentralized protocols all compete for ether deposits to issue a staked east derivative token on ethereum and the one the staked ether derivative token that's issued on ethereum that is issued by a decentralized staking as a service provider will be the trustless you know assure high assurances high uh a low risk token that i think will come to be the status quo for a derivative token on ethereum well at least that's what the protocol sync thesis would predict which we are big advocates of and has a pretty good track record in this space that the most credibly neutral protocols win david speaking of developments on ethereum l2 is coming let's talk a little bit about this big news ave a token so this is their interest bearing tokens we talk about so much uh thanks ave for the for for sponsoring bankless and making this this possible they have just ported some of their interest bearing tokens to the matic network what is the matic network yeah mautic network is an l2 on ethereum uh it's its competitive advantage is is a decently uh expressive l2 one of the big problems behind l2 designs is that we had trouble in ethereum development making them uh as touring complete or as expressive or as smart as the actual ethereum base layer matic has solved that problem uh that is so they have this l2 that has composability and they have smart contracts and that's that's pretty unique um and uh ave has put their interest bearing deposits onto matic network uh and so for for people that are are managing these interest bearing deposits they can use them on the matic network with much lower gas fees and i think this is part of just the story of ethereum scaling we saw synthetics roll out their l2 with optimistic roll-ups it looks like ave is going on matic and this is going to be just another one of ethereum's big applications uh finding ways to save its users on gas with l2s yeah i'm super excited about this i remember the the 2017 bull run it was always well here are some possible theoretical ways for ethereum to scale in the future and there was the you know state channels rating networks going to to to scale everything and then there was plasma as sort of the holy grail different era now we actually have solutions that are here and being used so it's exciting to see them being adopted i think we'll cover that in future rollups as well coinbase that's something else we're going to be covering in the future what are they just they're teasing us they're offering a secondary market for their private shares ahead of their public stock listing as if this wasn't one of the biggest ipos anticipated ipos in crypto they're uh they're offering it to the secondary market ahead of time what does this mean david yeah so everyone wants to get in on the coinbase ipo like i'm i have zero legacy assets i have zero equity assets but i would know i've got no stonks but i would still buy the coinbase ipo just because i think it would it was probably a good bet wait wait would you buy it over uni tokens though well i already got my uni tokens okay um when are they going to give us retrospective air drops huh i've been playing bases here for a while yeah right like i've played coinbase plenty of fees where's my airdrop where's my uh you know they should follow in their competition footsteps uh what my question is is this secondary listing of this private shares ahead of the public stock trading who gets to access that do i get to access that i'm not a credited investor who gets to access that um that i don't think i don't think it's available for uh typical retail investors to be able to access now this would probably be an accredited investor thing for sure on the secondary market and mostly for like employee liquidity purposes uh david some other things d5 protocols are continuing to ship so kyber it's been around for a long time fantastic liquidity uh provider in the d5 space they just launched a bunch of things uh including their v3 release and this v3 release focuses on liquidity particularly providing incentives for their liquidity providers which is something they've been quite good at any comments here yeah kyber is kind of an unsung hero i think when it comes to liquidity in ethereum before uniswap was the the shelling point of liquidity kyber was and it actually still is on a decent number of trading pairs kyber is actually one of the most liquid networks liquidity networks in ethereum they are not an amm like uniswap is they have a different way of providing liquidity to ethereum and that offers more options more modularity with how liquidity providers want to be able to use their liquidity with unit swap you kind of only have one option you have to deposit equal amounts of two assets into a pool kyber gives you more optionality with how liquidity providers can can offer liquidity it's a little bit more capital efficient and some of the main updates in this kyber 3.0 update are just furthering uh and bolstering the tools that liquidity providers have and how they provide liquidity to kyber speaking of which alpha hemorrha is an interesting d5 protocol too they just put out their second version an interesting protocol for yield farmers so folks that were already generating yield on governance tokens in the farms can now take leverage on eath and other assets and actually generate more yield so yield two and a half x year yield this is uh really a degen type of tool so i'm not sure how i comfortable i would be with it but um there is a way to actually lend each to this protocol and it's generating some pretty substantial returns so like the seven eight percent rate and it's locked up a massive amount of eve david so like 500 000 eth it's locked up right now in alpha hamora what do you make of that absolutely crazy the what i make of that is that it's product market fit man like uh leveraged yield farming with ether deposits like i'm i'm not personally going to put my eth in there because you know that's a little risky for my takes but like d phi d gens who want to yield farm with leverage in an automated fashion that saves them on gas like no alpha has oh i promise i wouldn't swear uh no wonder like alpha has gotten like almost 0.5 of all outstanding east supply in its contracts like that's just product market fit like that's just d5 degeneracy at its best and i mean that in the best way possible yeah ibeth is the product for that that's where you deposit your ether inside and you're right that's that's getting closer to five percent of all eth in circulation goes to show you how these money protocols can just be eath monsters eat gobblers sucking up all of that economic bandwidth uh that we talk about so much david back to layer twos for a minute starkware released their roadmap and they were talking about a permissionless stark powered layer to built around zk rollups with and this is important turning complete functionality so the ability to program on top of this layer too if that felt a little bit jargony for you then you have to check out the vitalik podcast and video that we just put out where he walks through roll-ups but this technology it's a little bit away so it's a year or two maybe three years away but this is really the holy grail for ethereum scalability uh any thoughts on this yeah that that's exactly right so this is the version of rollups that vitalik is particularly hot about he he made the uh the estimation that it's going to be optimistic roll ups in the near term that really kind of uh get going with ethereum and find a lot of product market fit but vitalik in the long term believes that uh zk roll ups are going to be the dominant form over the long term and this is the one of the first steps to rolling that out into the ethereum ecosystem definitely check out that video uh this that video is coming out roughly around the same time that this one is it's already out uh and so you know just another video with italic coming out on the bankless youtube and vancouver's podcast all right and we're talking about all of the layer twos somebody put together a fantastic actually i think kevin owaki did put together this fantastic index of all the layer twos we'll include this in the show notes but you can check out all of the different layer twos that are in development their various stats transaction cost how consensus works and their transactions per second just a lot of work going on in that space very exciting so this was really interesting to david some liquidity pools from uniswap the these are assets of course that are composed of uniswap liquidity uh like pairs of liquidity one specifically for wrapped bitcoin and eath and another for usdc eth liquidity pools were just approved to be collateral in the maker dow system so that means they are backing the value of dye what's the significance of this yeah the significance is that unit swap collateral unit swap liquidity tokens are being added as collateral into maker dow which allows people to draw die against their liquidity positions in uniswap and not only usdc eth pairs are being added to make her dao but dai and eath die each pair out of uniswop if you submit eath and die to unit swap you get a token back this is how unit swap works and you then you can now take that token to maker dao put that into a vault and make her dao and draw die against the di eth pair that you've deposited into uniswap so if you can add you can add liquidity to dye you can make a dye more liquid by adding liquidity to unit swap and then you can take that position and then draw more dye against it making dyed it's a fantastic positive feedback loop of die supply that i really expect this to be one of the main things that adds supply to dye both supply and liquidity it's a two-for-one punch it's really awesome and and that's just a nice benefit to people that really want to contribute to the maker dot protocol i think if maker dow came around uh in maybe 2019 2020 this would be a yield farm i bet you it because naked out the migrator they already have their mkr token kind of locked into how they like it but i i foresee a uh alternative universe where the maker dow protocol or something similar to it came in and started issuing mkr rewards to people that do this if i had my fingers in the mkr token economics i would issue mkr rewards to people that that do this just to incentivize liquidity this is actually a normal playbook from d5 protocols nowadays um but pretty cool innovation by maker dao pretty cool new collateral just more options for dye to become liquid and of course it's really important that dye is liquid in ethereum yeah it's it's also an example of a superfluid collateral the the ability for these collateral um the collateral tokenized collateral on ethereum to be used across all of these various money protocols i always think a liquidity pools is kind of interesting because it's not only a bet on the assets and the ratios of those assets inside of a uniswap liquidity pool but it's also a bet on unit swap trading volume which makes it a unique asset that is not available anywhere outside of defy and a very decentralized asset at that so very cool to see dye starting to adopt that dot ryan if you go to that dye stats page you'll you'll see that the there is a three million dollar die limit on both u.s uh bitcoin and ether uniswap tokens and a three million die limit on uh usdc and ether and also a three million limit on die ether liquidity pairs uh that's a relatively low uh ceiling uh ford die there's only you know three million per uniswap token the reason why this is so low is that this is actually a new there's a new oracle system providing the value of these uniswap tokens going into maker dow so maker dow previously uses other oracles to understand what the prices are of the assets inside the program inside the protocol this is because these are uniswap tokens there's a different or there's a maker down needed a different way to test and understand the value of these assets because now there's a waiting between it's one one part eth one part die or one part bitcoin one part eth and so there's a new oracle providing new information to the maker dab protocol and that is why the debt ceiling is so low as people get more comfortable as the maker down mkr voters get more comfortable with this new type of asset i expect the debt ceiling on these uh lp tokens to increase it significantly and so that just means we can put more and more inside of maker dow and uh withdraw collateral based on it okay cool that is the those are the releases for this week let's talk news of course our main event we're going to get to in a little bit which is everything that's going on in game the gamestop world uh but we'll get to that soon let's talk about some of these other things i thought it's really cool it's an artifact of open finance that we can actually track the assets that individual uh funds popular funds uh hold and and trade this is from sorry this is a watch list of all of the assets that placeholder ventures our friend chris breninski holds inside of his fund very cool that you can do that i think in open finance and this is very much a an unlock i think for for all of us to be able to see what thought leaders what individual funds are are holding inside of their wallets yeah i think this actually does contrast very well with the gamestop conversation uh not to i know i said we were going to tease that but uh this is an inside out industry people's bags are transparent like there's no hidden information right and because there's no hidden information people like missouri uh the the data website are publishing people's bags because that's already that's information that's available um and so it's one part of privacy concern like you know everyone should understand that your bags and your addresses are public um but that also means that everyone is on an equal informational playing field which is not something that we can find in the legacy markets yup okay next two things are about more firms buying bitcoin so this is a nasdaq listed company marathon patent group buying 150 million dollars worth of bitcoin that seems to be a recurring trend in 2021 firms buying publicly traded companies buying more bitcoin adding it to the balance sheet speaking of which microstrategy bought even more bitcoin how much did they buy this time david they did it again this is their smallest purchase ever which is me really curious about this 10 million dollars a modest 10 million dollars on i think what is already like seven or eight hundred million dollars i could be wrong about that um but uh i think this is it's interesting just to every time microstrategy buys bitcoin uh that's always interesting but it's interesting as how small this is just like it's a drop in the bucket of all the bitcoins that they already own just a casual 10 million just dollar cost averaging in as one does into crypto yeah and so like this people talk about like is michael saylor trying to do like a bitcoin pump and dump like is he trying to really pump the price of bitcoin and maybe he is but i don't really think so i think he is actually a bitcoin believer and so i think any spare change that microstrategy has is going into bitcoin so i just pulled this up bitcointreasuries.org they have 70 700 bitcoins which is at today's value 2.3 billion dollars so microstrategy adds on 10 million dollars onto their 2.3 billion dollar supply of bitcoins it's crazy how well that has worked out for them um let's talk about janet yellen again we talked about her last week she is of course the new treasury secretary she's going to be overseeing important things like fincen um she came out with a more bullish quote on crypto this week last last week she said something bad that made headlines this week she's saying u.s government should consider the benefits of cryptocurrencies and digital assets perhaps walking back some of her statements from from last week you know this really reminds me of the conversation that uh we will be publishing on monday but the conversation we had with um uh with jeremy alaire from circle and we we went through 2021 and whether there were going to be more headwinds or more tailwinds from from regulators it always seems to be there's this conflicting message sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad but it's never fully one or the other almost like they're lukewarm on crypto at the moment what's your take here yeah i the the yell in statements from last week was linked to the drop in bitcoin price that happened last week people saying that there's a bunch of regulatory fund i didn't really put much weight into that analysis and now this week janet yellen is saying you know hey there's actually is some value that could be leveraged by public blockchains you know i just don't think janet yellen is really all that informed and i think both of these statements are relatively boiler boilerplate and don't really mean all that much we're going to have to wait for real action real tangible action coming out of uh janet yellen and uh and the the rest of regulation like all these boilerplate comments are just not helpful to try and interpret his news we are wait and see mode uh meanwhile some mayors are pretty hot on crypto this is the mayor of miami who is talking about turning miami into an economic hub for crypto innovation i think that this is going to be a popular narrative and this is why regulators and those in government cannot ignore crypto there's just tremendous opportunity economic opportunity job opportunity that their constituents will want and i think this will drive the adoption of crypto what's your take there yeah bitcoiners often call bitcoin a mind virus and instead of thinking of you know it's bitcoin versus state or like public blockchains versus the nation state i think it's actually much more suitable to think of like public blockchains as viruses that creep into people's brains and convince them that they are the best thing about the the best thing about the world right now and that's i've caught that bug i know you've caught that bug ryan it seems like the mayor of miami has caught that bug and the important takeaway is that there's totally a path where bitcoin and ethereum as mined viruses uh infect people in positions of power around the around the globe including our own regulators including our own governors including our own mayors and we just have these uh protocols adopted because the people that use them are also in positions of power absolutely all right let's talk about china for a minute we do from time to time so ethereum-based consensus that is a big development studio that is developing tooling for ethereum they just partnered with the blockchain network of china um is this good or bad what does this mean yeah this is something to keep uh one's eye on that quorum used to be a private consortium blockchain and i think it still is uh based off of consensus owned by consensus and so you know very much aligned with the essos of china to run a blockchain that is uh you know much more centralized much more private much more controlled but still blockchain is creeping into every single corner of the world and it's interesting to watch consensus help other entities lead that charge um public public permissionless blockchains are different from what's going on here but you know blockchain technology you know i'm not a i'm not a blockchain not bitcoiner but i do think there is value in blockchain as a technology and i'd like to see that uh proliferated and that's what's going on yeah and particularly as it's linked into public blockchain i think this lads lends some more credibility to the idea that their governments might have their own private ledgers and and private chains even but ultimately they're going to have to settle on some credibly neutral infrastructure a public network like ethereum and this just provides the china's blockchain network with a conduit and a bridge to do that so i think we'll have to see how that plays out speaking of china david i've i've been wondering a lot about polka dot these days um the token price of dots has been just like off the like off the charts just crazy right um yet adoption hasn't this there are some projects building on polka dot but we don't see the the transaction fee revenue uh on on polka dot that we see on on bitcoin it's largely empty blocks it's largely a ghost chain now that could change in the future absolutely something to watch out for but right now that is what it is but dots are super hot in china i think this may be the reason price is pumping in the way it is or at least one of the core reasons any takes on that yeah um has a different consensus system than ethereum does and it's a little bit um the topological design i should not be uh considered an expert in polka dot at all so take this with a grain of salt the topological design of polka dot allows for a little bit more governance and control over what goes on in the base train than what ethereum does and so i find that interesting that china of all places which it has a society and like in asian countries tend to be a little bit in this disposition or demeanor they're a little bit more control with top down um stop top down control the chinese population is used to top down control and polka dot has sort of a top-down control mechanism in his consensus so i find that that resonance between polka dot and china a little bit interesting yeah there it's going to be interesting to see whether polka dot can build something of lasting value or whether it's taking the eos approach which of course did very well in china for a period of time and uh now is nowhere to be seen i mean no one's doing anything with eos um big blocks you know uh delegated proof of stake did not work out over the long run so we'll we'll have to see what happens corner is on your blockchain folks that's right uh you can't do that have to preserve credible neutrality dydx they just raised 10 million and they put out this report david i don't know if you got a chance to see it but i was blown away by the numbers so first of all two and a half billion in trade volume dydx of course is a decentralized exchange and uh it provides margin in the same way a bit max did but it does so in a decentralized way and the like ever like uh the trades are transparent so you always know the house isn't um betting against you but this stat was astounding to me 17.4 billion in loans originated in 2021 17.4 billion that's b that's billion with a b uh pretty incredible david um this is just a great platform and next month they are actually moving to uh layer two so they're rolling out their own layer two solution built on some starkware tech i'm pretty excited about it what's your take here yeah dydx is one of the great big disincs which is one of and also usdc and also east and so like dydx has an application is one of the great reasons why there's yield behind dye uscc and e that's important to know uh there's also speculation on a dydx token question mark not can i i don't know anything and i don't think that there's been statements from the team at all but i think there are rumors going around that there could be a retroactive airdrop as we all know and love coming out of dydx unconfirmed yeah i'm cautiously optimistic uh if there was a dydx token i would be a recipient of one absolutely that's because you use the protocol so much and and guys if you know we we put out a post recently about some future air docks just kind of speculating and predicting there is value in using these protocols now um not only value in leveling up but also due to these retrospective airdrops i mean last year if you collected all of the airdrops that were available it was like 20 thousand dollars or something crazy and guys all this entails is actually using metamask using a d5 wallet connecting to these applications and using them of course that might not remain the case for dydx no promises but it's uh it's worth a shot is it not spend some spend 10 minutes of your time to go figure this stuff out um david let's end with mark cuban so mark cuban is getting in the nft world it seems this is this is deep into d5 this is just i have ether that i own on coinbase or um you know even i've used ave this is he's actually minting an nft using wearable from his own pri public ethereum address this is pretty deep i'm pretty impressed by this what's your take yeah what was interesting is that when that mark cuban made this nft which uh double check me on the numbers but i think it listed for 0.2 eth and then it sold for 17 000 a few blocks later so somebody really wanted that mark cuban nft really badly um but in in process like we were saying earlier this is a public ecosystem and when mark cuban mints an nft and sells it people know where that nfc came from and so people took a look at mark cuban's bags uh mark cuban is a sushi token owner by the way for those that didn't want to know he's got sushi in his bags he's got a few other things you can you can uh find that tweet and investigate yourself if you really want to want to find out but uh what that what really is interesting to me is like you know he's a sushi swap owner sushi swap isn't even the leading amm in defy uniswap is so like mark cuban's deep in defy right now he has got his fingers in the weeds uh i think i i'm i got my fingers crossed he's coming on bank list for a podcast in the future yeah well you can see my uh my tweet right underneath like uh prompting him as such so fingers crossed david that could be the case we will see what happens um david let's get into some takes so that was news this is the first take why'd you like this one this is uh someone saying ethereum not blockchain that's it three words ethereum not blockchain yeah this is a jay who's another uh podcast co-host um and she says ethereum not blockchain and you know i've i find myself keeping on right when i do my writing i talk about like the cryptocurrency industry or i talk about public permissionless blockchains but what the hell am i even talking about i'm really just talking about if i'm talking about public permissionless blockchains i'm just talking about bitcoin and ethereum so i'll just say those things or if i'm talking about the cryptocurrency industry most of the time i'm basically just talking about the ethereum industry uh and so like when people talk about like yo i'm i work in crypto or i talk about cryptocurrencies like no it's actually just ethereum like maybe this is me my eth maxi hat getting getting put on which i'm happy to wear but like the the the cryptocurrency industry is mostly noise except for what is the ethereum side of that cryptocurrency industry so let's just start calling it ethereum it's the ethereum industry ethereum not blockchain there you go all right that's david with his ethereum maximalist hat on um let's let's do another ethereum take here proof of stake versus proof of work on energy this has not been a narrative that has entered into the mainstream consciousness yet it's something that has been talked about at various times but of course proof of work is a massive energy consumer right so all of all of the miners that like operate that economically secure the bitcoin network and the ethereum network on proof of work today consume a tremendous amount of electricity and power and that has an impact of course on the environment but proof of stake does not have that same impact right it has almost like no impact on the environment vance spencer here is making the comment that more uh esg funds so these are environmentally um savvy funds will not allocate to proof of work systems like bitcoin so what he's saying is proof of work or cryptocurrency networks that employ proof of work will um not be viewed favorably for a number of investors and perhaps government bodies and and the world in the future and proof of stake has an advantage there what's your take on this yeah i'm on the fence about the proof of work sustainability arguments uh i'm actually a believer that over the long term the extra consumption by bitcoin energy consumption is actually a net positive i think it could there's a very strong argument that it actually in the long term can promote green energy consumption incentivize green energy consumption i'm compelled by that argument in the near term i think that it could be a massive part of the 2021 news cycle as people focus in on the on climate change as climate change moves to the forefront especially under a biden presidency i think bitcoin could actually be plagued by its branding as a very energy consumptive network which is it is it's like taking up one to two percent of the world's electricity it's insane um i i i and and this is a frequent topic of conversation on my podcast with uh christian corollas of bitcoin magazine we talk about this and and we both generally agree that like over the long term the the merits of bitcoin energy consumption could be positive um but like this article states like i think the short-term uh fud about bitcoin's energy consumption will be a significant toxic plague that plagues its brand for for many many years to come yeah so you've got definitely a narrative issue despite what the the truth ends up being about bitcoin's impact uh in in like the environment i'm not actually sure what i think yet i think i i need to take a look at some more data there's certainly environmental externalities that need to be considered when you're consuming this massive amount of energy but i guess the bitcoiner argument is that essentially it's it's using energy that otherwise would not be used in good away so these energy sources are greener than other energy sources i think that's really a like something that you you don't over the long run need to form an opinion on like the data will just bear it out and and show us so it's kind of a thesis i know that bitcoiners want that to be true though like and i understand they want it to be true [Laughter] but i'm not sure that it is at least uh i i'd need to see some more data on that so let's go to the next take so institutions adopting eth is money david it's happening i read an article in coinbase that basically said institutions are saying ether is a store of value look at this the case for owning ethereum ether we hear most frequently from our clients is a combination of first it's evolving potential as a store of value it's evolving potential not oil ether as a store of value as a money second as its status as a digital commodity oh my god they almost got all three just add staking and they have the triple point asset thesis here um pretty incredible because back in 2017 and before uh no one was saying this least of all institutions but basically no one was saying it at the time do you think this is a narrative change that that's going to take hold in 2021 absolutely and i think this is actually indications that this has already taken hold and there's only going to be more talk of this um like i was saying in the last roll-ups people are coming in into this industry with a blank slate like they are not coming in with bias they don't have a bias to bias them their opinions are largely unformed uh and so the value proposition of ether doesn't have uh this plaguing branding of just being gas for ethereum which is just it was in that that belief was antiquated back in 2017 but it takes time for data and facts and knowledge to proliferate in the same way that ryan you were just talking about like people are just going to have to wait for um that the bitcoin energy consumption narrative to show up with facts and figures you know ethereum but before we had like the evidence that we have today back in 2017 ether could have been argued as as if it was gas and it totally was argued to be that now we have the facts and figures and we have the facts and figures you know they started to brew in 2018 they grew a lot in 2019 and now they are growing out of the surface into the mainstream media into the mainstream knowledge that ether is a store of value non-sovereign asset just like bitcoin and it has its own unique compelling value propositions the world is waking up to this and that makes me really bullish well said yes how do we know it is money it's because it's being used as money that's exactly how we know there's increasing evidence of that and it's very plain to see hard to argue otherwise eric voorhees one of our favorite folks in crypto is talking about the value of airdrops last year we talked about this a little bit earlier this is where i got this this stat but the the quote he tweets is assuming you were an average defy investor and a bankless listener and a bankless reader of course this past year and only used uh one address so one ethereum address only you made nearly 20 000 in airdrops alone this is because projects d5 projects retrospectively retrospectively rewarded their users with token drops and eric says this seems nuts but consider what d5 projects are doing all they're doing is paying users to use them rather than paying advertising advertisers to use them so essentially what he's saying is guys this is just marketing budget and this is what marketing costs and it's a genius move except that marketing isn't going to like facebook ads or google ads it's actually going to users who then propagate uh their their love for the community through through free advertising and marketing it's pretty ingenious yeah i'd love to know of the tweet that eric voorhees is retweeting i'd love to know the tallies that uh nick the the tweeter tallied together when he talked about the airdrops um obviously uni is one uh which was airdropped at roughly a value of twelve hundred dollars when uniswap was three dollars a token which is now just under eighteen or fifteen dollars a token uh there's also one inch there's also tornado cash there's also dig um badger there's a bunch of air drops yeah uh and so it is valuable to just use these things like sorry gas fees are really high but like fingers crossed you'll just be compensated by air drops it has certainly paid to be a d5 user in uh in 2020 and i think it will in 2021 as well we are so early it's still so early um last last take here this is a take by afri actually i don't have it pulled up david but uh i will pull that up in a minute and what he says is basically he's pretty flummoxed that banks are charging negative interest rates yeah i'll read it out here afree says afri is a core used to be a core ethereum developer i think he stepped back but definitely uh very much involved with the ethereum community aphry says my bank just informed me that they will now charge half a percent negative interest on my fiat holdings it's really hard to understand the purpose of a bank in 2021 fiat whatsoever uh just imagine the potential of anything and not requiring a bank hmm i i agree aufrey i agree with this idea why why you about offering is like he he's very bullish ethereum but like he's he's been very pretty bearish i think on d5 in general and anything involving involving money so to hear him say this as he's looking at his traditional bank account and looking at a half a percent negative interest rate is pretty astounding so we're convincing even the skeptics here yeah abs absolutely and uh if that just doesn't scream bankless then i don't know what does gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemini

we talk about what is going on with gamestop why don't we start there dude what is going on with gamestop all right so i'm gonna explain the backstory here because it's important to understand the story going on here um for those that have watched the movie the big short the big short movie depicted this guy who manages a hedge fund who just did some math and saw that there was a ton of uh there was a ton of uh there's a problem in the housing market right so he basically called the housing market and so he wanted to he opened up a short on the american economy basically and then the big short is about just all the people that saw the coming collapse of the housing market and this guy particularly made his fund a bunch of money this same guy in in in the movie the the character that the the the real the real person this is a true story uh that real person uh made a similar call so now that he's a legend for calling the 08 crisis uh people follow him people pay attention to him and he what he did with this gamestop call is that he looked at the gamestop share price he noticed that it was at trading at a particular value and then he went and he tallied up all of the assets that gamestop owns like the the real estate the property all the real assets like no never mind the businesses this is like their book value right the book value yeah the assets on the balance sheet and he said that he thought that the share price was not inclusive of all the value that the company actually owned like there's the straight physical assets uh and so he said that he is going to make a long position on gamestop because the value of the of the asset the value of the company is trading well below at the actual value of the underlying assets that they own okay so and where did he say this because i remember the big short in 2008 like no one would listen to him he kept going to all these people and everyone was like yeah whatever shut up like we're not listening where did he start saying this uh i i don't know i don't know the answer to that question i just do know that it was public and it started it started brewing in the wall street bets uh subreddit server so for those that aren't familiar with the subreddit uh the subreddit server wall street bets it's kind of d5 gens will find themselves very fit very well in there it's people that try and make like yolo bets where they they put a ton of money on the line and they do it they mainly do it for engagement and they either make a ton of money or they lose a ton of money there are there's memes it's a little bit like for 4chan culture there's there's memes the degeneracy just like you know all the memes that you see coming out of corners of the internet like this was present in wall street bets okay so like i want to understand the wall street bets culture because i think this is important before we go on to the rest of the story right so like my impression of wall street bets culture is like uh they're degens they're trying to they're trying to make money but they know this is all a game right like they very much know that the system is rigged and is is set against them and that money printer is going bur and it's distorting the fundamental value of all of these assets including stocks and they're just like what the hell we might as well benefit from this too is that the culture is that the philosophy of wall street bets you know i don't think it was uh it certainly is now i i think it wasn't necessarily that i i think maybe the money printer gober was in there just as a casual meme it was mainly just a meme of just like degenerate yolowers um who like people and i think mainly very wealthy people would just like you know yolo a hundred dollars into options um and options for those that don't know are a way to make or lose a bunch of money all at once um but i i would say in order to understand wall street bets culture you would need to understand uh it is very similar to some of the green frog culture that we see in the crypto space um there's very much this headless movement it's a cohort it's a community right there are no leaders it's just what the community thinks and so if you've ever participated in like a chain-link community or or 4chan community these are very similar communities no one is the leader but these all the you're kind of a rise as a similar energy a similar um just community out of these people right and so uh back to the story uh and so this guy this that's famous for calling the 08 crisis says that gamestop is worth more than what the share price is and so he buys a position and that information leaks out into the internet public knowledge and the wall street bets uh subreddit grabs a hold of this and they start kind of piling on they then some there are some extremely savvy informed investors who do their own analysis in wall street bets and some of the wall street best community like listens to these people and so the this trade became became more or less public knowledge inside the wall street bets subreddit and so that means that a bunch of these wall street bets they they all put their capital into the same spot and that's a very interesting phenomenon that we're seeing inside of wall street bets we're seeing inside of projects like chain link we're seeing that in the project in projects that are like run up by green frogs on 4chan people are coordinating and injecting capital in specific places to pump collectively pump backs that's that's what that's going on here but but at the same time there's also this fundamentally true and sound trade beneath all these things so gamestop or excuse me for wall street bets they identify this trade in gamestop and they all start buying spot they all start taking and and putting gme stock into their portfolios and what that does is that increases the price of the game stop uh stock and so now we have to talk about hedge funds and yeah yes yeah so where did that so where do the hedge funds fit into this picture and like shorts we've heard that term as well right so we need to understand the concept of a short squeeze and so when you are going short an asset that means you are hoping that the price goes down and what that means is that when you short an asset you borrow it from someone and so say i have a stock that's worth a hundred dollars and you want to short the ass that you want to short that stock um ryan and so you borrow that stock from me and it's at a hundred dollars and then the stock goes down to fifty dollars and then uh you when you borrowed that stock from me you actually sold it on the market for a hundred dollars so you can put that hundred dollars into your pocket kept that there and then the stock went down fifty dollars and then you bought that stock back off the market and gave that stock back to me and then you pocketed that fifty dollar difference right that's a short that's ideal uh if you want to short as a an asset it goes down in price and you get the pocket the difference based off of the moment you shorted it it goes it can go really really wrong in the opposite direction because say say you borrow a stock from me at a hundred dollars and then you sell it and and you're going to return that stock to me at a later date but instead of that stock going down from a 100 to 50 it goes up from 100 to 200 or maybe 300 or maybe 500 i have to pay that entire diff you have to pay any number it could be it's an infinite level of risk it could go to a million dollars and you have to pay back a million dollars even if you just shorted that stock at 100 so there's a large amount of risk and the thing what that funds were doing is many large hedge funds very wealthy which are just made up by wealthy investors were shorting game star basically into the ground and what the important point about this story is that there were there are alleged accusations of naked short selling which is short selling the stock without actually borrowing the underlying stock in the first place right which means that more than the total supply of gamestop shop uh gamestop shares were being shorted which means it's it's like a fractional reserve system it's kind of way how do people get away with naked short selling because it's illegal and done behind the scenes so i'm pretty sure it's illegal is it illegal youtube comments let us know if it's illegal or not it's yeah i would think that would be definitely illegal okay so these these funds are doing possibly naked shorts which is like it doesn't get any risky right like it's not only illegal uh quite possibly um it's it's also they're betting essentially that this stock does not go up in value at all and they don't even have the the stock backing that bet essentially okay so they're completely exposed here completely exposed and they they think that they can just short the stock into the ground and make a bunch of money on these shorts right and like honestly maybe it's it's bad maybe it's not right to like put um sentiments into this but like gamestop is a brick and mortar business and during times of covid like you know i think if somebody said you for shorting a stock a brick and mortar company during covert times i i would i would agree with that you know markets are supposed to be efficient but you know kind of kind of  you um and anyways so okay so like there we have a large and the the thing about shorts is that a short squeeze can happen and so if you are if you are exposed to a short as in like you you owe shares back to someone and those shares double in price all of a sudden you have to buy back that the the shares that you borrowed at a higher price but if you buy back those shares say you're saying like all right i don't want this trade anymore like i've lost money i'm just gonna buy back the shares i'll cut my losses and i'll pay back and i'll return the shares to their owner if you do that you buy back the shares and that increases the price because you bought them back which means further shorts are then pressured even more because as shorts pay buy back their shares off the secondary market to cover they push the price up and up and up which causes more and more shorts to be influenced to buy back shares and so it's called a short squeeze this thing is explosive it can turn into a positive feedback loop of people buying back shares off the market and remember there was more outstanding short interest than if the floating supply of stock of game stock the shares and so this thing just rocketed from 20 a share up to like 350 a share in like three days right and so all the companies that were cut short are down like 99.9 on their position right and these are all hedge funds and so this is where the drama starts okay so so let me ask you here so wall street bets culture obviously they want to benefit from this trade right right we understand that rationale do they also want to screw the hedge funds do they want to screw the bankers was that part of the uh notion behind this no this is a that is a secondary after effect they just saw a position they just saw a heavily shorted stock and they they all decided as a community saying like hey if we all buy gamestop so many of these hedge funds will have to cover their shorts that it could trigger a short squeeze that's exactly what happened okay so what happened what happened to these hedge funds david i'm looking at the uh all right gamestop short sellers lost 1.6 billion in a single day as reddit traders rebelled against them that's a fan that's a 2021 headline i feel like this is this is a pretty this is a pretty massive event this is like uh main street investors retail investors kind of sticking it to the funds in a way that's been the kind of the net effect but the funds got to be pissed about this i mean oh i'm sure did not be pissed if i lost money too but like this sort of thing is um let me say outside of the rules of play it's it's a complete off script move no hedge fund trader like they're they're all aware of of the other traders and other hedge funds who might be coming after them but none of them anticipated a an online community to take this kind of an action so they were completely caught off guard they shouldn't be caught off guard if they were paying attention to the fundamentals of gamestop because they should know that there was a massive amount of short interest out on gamestop and everyone knows what a short squeeze is this is not like esoteric information a short squeeze is public knowledge right and the other interesting thing is wall street bets is a public discord or well it's also a discord it's also a subreddit um so all the all the coordination in the subreddit was done in a public forum where the hedge funds and all their naked short selling is done behind behind the curtain you know private private knowledge you don't get to know that information and so like this is absolutely a story of just like the little guy versus the big elites who have who have access to financial instruments and have access to financial resources and and capital that no one else has access to yet the wall street bets subreddit they saw the weakness in the armor and they all realize if they all just go buy the stock they're going to be able to short squeeze these funds who are trying to wreck this country uh this company into the ground they're going to short squeeze them into oblivion and that's exactly what happened okay so fair story so far it sounds like right fair stories are all within the rules of play here uh you know hedge funds are taking massive amounts of of risk in in taking out these kinds of positions you know naked short selling aside it's still a massive amount of risk when you're shorting something and this online community wall street bets is just doing what it normally does it's seeing an opportunity and it's pouncing on that opportunity as a community and the market response and the stock goes up and it's story right but like it's not the end of story no it's not the end of the story because the hedge funds and the banking class has something that this this wall street bets rabble right this crowd this online community does not have they have connections connections they have they have they have instant institutional prowess they have people that they can call on the phone to get to take certain actions against the unwashed masses in in the subreddit so what happened so this one and so a lot a large amount of these wall street bets traders trade on robinhood right this is the retail trader the little guy right so they use the robin hood application to make their trades robin hood shut down trading on uh the gamestop uh stock and also the amc stock amc theaters right another asset that has heavy heavy short interest that started to become a target of further uh you know further wall street bet short squeezes saying like hey like we just short squeezed the out of gamestop we could probably do it for amc and that began to happen and yet robin hood canceled all trading activity on gamestop and amc as of this morning and not only that but also td ameritrade and it gets even worse we're going to show some some tweets and some links in a second they even took their clients positions and sold them for them while they while the trading activity was halted robin hood and td ameritrade and other brokerages made orders on behalf of their customers to sell this stock because of market volatility and market risks so they did other things with other people's money because allegedly from what we understand what we think is is true is that people who had a connections at these funds that got wrecked i can't remember the name of the fund called up uh robin hood and said yo shut this down and we think that's what happened and we think that's what exactly what robin hood did they shut down trading they first they tried to pause the market when when uh two days ago i think when when the gamestop share price went went up too fast they also was right this was like nasdaq was was threatening to you nasdaq halted trading because because and they were that was after funds started screaming that they needed to recalibrate their positions and so they wanted to halt trading what is that other than these funds these these funds were going bankrupt going bankrupt going absolutely destroyed so not only losing billions but like it it's costing them their entire business the entire fund the entire fund because there is no risk on short selling right and so they're making phone calls and then like so they they they stopped uh trading for a while and they threatened to stop trading so that happened but this morning was the action that that you're talking about which is kind of like the i you know unprecedented unprecedented yeah where robin hood like robin hood this is what all the wall street bets traders use this is this is kind of their life stream into you into finance basically that was being shut down completely from these assets and their their assets were being sold without their permission exactly exactly right and so this is why we talk when we talk about uniswap and we talk about being able to control trading and you can't turn it off and you can't permission you can't permission the assets so you can't permission the network this is why this is important because a bunch of headphones made a bunch of calls to a bunch of their market running friends saying like hey i want this to stop because i'm losing money and they did it and they listened and not only that but discord which is one of my favorite applications canceled the wall street bets discord server that's they i mean private company sure they get to cancel whoever they want because it's a private company but like where are these people supposed to meet like this the wall street bet subreddit had to get locked because it was getting briganded by just a bunch of randos discord is canceling their server preventing them from being able to coordinate as people like there's nothing more than oppression and silencing than just being able to cancel the place that these people meet and congregate it's a violation of what makes america so great and like maybe it's not a constitutional violation because it's because private companies get to silence speech as much as they want but it's still stupid well so so everyone's saying like people are angry about this and justifiably so it's because basically the the baker class and and the elites and the people with connections and billions of dollars and and and funds were able to do things that like you and you and i or normal people average joes people that are on our slash wall street bets cannot do they don't have these connections it's like a different set of rules applies for one group of people versus versus another imagine the power just because you are getting wrecked on a trade to go de-list an asset like that's an insane amount of power and what's so crazy about this david is like they just did it in broad daylight daylight no brazen like what did they think that people weren't going to be pissed that like we weren't going to talk about this that there wasn't going to be massive anger they just delisted the assets i mean these are robin hood's own customers right i i can't imagine the amount of pressure that was on robin hood to get them to turn against their own customers that affects their business model economically there must be a massive amount of power here to or leverage to do something like that yeah people are making calls to say delete delete robinhood delete de-list robinhood from or delete it from your phone that's a hashtag that's getting trending on on twitter ryan let's go through some of the the tweets and links that we have pulled up ready to go um representative telev actually the same person behind the stable act calls for congressional hearing on robin hood's gamestop actions nice job like yes like this is a this is a securities market violation if we believe in free markets in this country in the united states then this people actually actually need to get some into congress they need to go to court somebody needs to go to jail or get fined so it's good to see representation uh talking about this issue okay what's what's the next tweet here oh yeah this is from uh russell he's a football player i'm not into sports so i'm not going to try and mispronounce his last name um but like this is this is what's going on this is a starting pistol for this entire industry especially for d5 russ is a big bitcoiner he is one of the few players in the nfl to get paid by bitcoin i don't think he knows about ethereum or defi yet but about if he did he'd be bullish on it gamestop get the dirty fiat and turn it into bitcoin immediately there's there's values virtues and ethos that are exuding out of this industry that the rest of the world needs that we need to export to the rest of the world all right let's go to the next one oh yeah ram capital he's a fun meme account uh looks like robin hood woke up today and chose violence yeah you robin hood [Laughter] all right tyler winklevoss you want this one uh okay so what does he say what kind of a soulless human being do you have to be to short a brick and mortar business during a pandemic these companies are not even allowed to legally operate these suits have no solidarity they care nothing about america i'm glad wall street bets is punching back right like he's basically saying look there's they're not good guys here right they're just trying to make money and so when they lose money they they they take on this risk and they lose money so what who cares be like put on your big boy pants like i mean this is what the markets do you got wrecked you've wrapped a whole bunch of other people in the past too this time you got wrecked you lost that's how the game is played bye bye see you later yeah no do-overs in public markets bro no do-overs you can't pull this kind of thing i agree with tyler there okay how about this one aoc is talking about this is dave portnoy this is dave portnoy of barstool sports he goes when aoc and donald trump jr are on the same side you know you up at robin hood app yeah aoc and donald trump jr both are populist individuals one's a populist for the right one is a populist for the left this is a populist issue this is a few against the many or uh yeah a few against the many issue and both aoc and donald trump jr are populist leaders for their respective camps and they're funnily enough aligned this is the uh wall street bets chairman here is this a meme account or is this an actual representative from wall street bets uh definitely well no one can truly represent wall street bets yet this guy is one of the leaders of of the community yeah okay so what's he saying here they can only control us because we use their currency so wall street bets historically has not been a crypto friendly uh community or subreddit right so it's true if you post something about crypto on wall street bets it gets auto banned i'm not sure if this was an outcropping of like 2017 or something where there were so many crypto spain like bitconnect it's just simpler for reddit moderators to just ignore the noise but they still maintain that posture and yet this is kind of making the wall street bets community open up to crypto open up as a solution that seems to be what this this tweet is saying we i mean we are certainly open to wall street bets i hope members of the wall street bet community understands that this industry is young and nascent and it's not the industry that it was back in 2017 we have grown a lot and all of a sudden a lot of our the things that we find valuable i think the wall street best community would also find extremely valuable absolutely all right let's go to this next one uh yeah one hedge fund blows up a million retail investors efficient markets instead a million retail investors blows up one hedge fund market manipulation this is a disc towards people that are uh for for the same reasons that the wall street bets discord server got cancelled because they are they the powers that be are are claiming that wall street bets is manipulating the market if buying spot is manipulating the market i guess we're all market manipulators like i guess when you buy something the price goes up like is that market manipulation no it's market manipulation to call up robinhood and say cancel trading that's market manipulation buying spot is not market manipulation yeah totally agree it's crazy that they would even propose that um what's this one yeah this is a screenshot of somebody who tried to uh set place an order inside of robin hood and robin hood gives them an error message uh they wanted to cancel the order that robin hood placed on their behalf robin hood shows them an error message saying we're sorry this order can't be canceled as we placed it to mitigate the risk to your account who the are you to control other people's money you don't know what risk is the only reason why markets know what risk is is because a diverse set of market participants all bear their own individual risks and they all place their own individual bets you don't get to determine what other people's risk is we're screwing you over for your safety you know this kind of reminds me we've talked about it so often but like the sec accredited investor laws where you have to have a certain net worth in order to invest in million dollars or over in order to invest at a startup um it's reminiscent of this sort of thing it's like sorry retail investor you're not smart enough you're not sophisticated enough to uh to do this so you're not elite enough to do this so we're gonna wall you off from this little corner of finance we're gonna handle this for you we're gonna sell your shares in the brokerage account because it's too dangerous absolutely insane that this is the error message that they would they would put up to do this one's even worse read this one out we don't let you buy only sell and even if you don't sell we will sell it against your will this is is this this is robinhood terms of service is this an email that someone got so that was a twitter comment about an email what's the email say yeah the email is from robinhood to this user's inbox i'm assuming and says important information about your robinhood account in light of recent volatility we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only aka you can only sell however due to the unreasonable risk involved in brokering your position we have closed your fourteen hundred fourteen thousand five hundred shares of gme that's gamestop for an average price of eighteen hund uh one hundred and eighteen dollars on january 18th 2021. they just made they just executed orders with their customers money on on their behalf that's crazy that's absolutely insane that's absolutely insane all right so what does this all mean right so like um populism people are pissed banks are doing things with political connections bankers and hedge fund managers and the wealthy elite are doing things that that retail can't do david d5 fixes this d5 fixes this this is what we have been chanting for so long so you can't you can't de-list an asset from uniswap in fact anyone in the world can list an asset on uniswap this is not just it it's not just it it hasn't happened on unison it can't happen can happen this is the idea behind protocols rather than banks this is the idea behind outsourcing this sort of like creating institutions that are not based on corruptable human beings right this is what defy is all about this openness this transparency this access to the world this everybody has a fair playing field it doesn't matter what country you're from it doesn't matter what bankers you know what politicians you can call how much money you have everybody is treated equally everybody is treated the same this is an institution that makes way more sense to build on top of than the corrupted banking institution right now it's like so um is this a defy moment like maybe stream doesn't realize it yet but is this a defy moment for us this is an absolute defy moment and i think if if people were more savvy to what's going on i think we would see uh because you know markets are supposed to be efficient if some news breaks then assets tend to move the reason why i think that you know people are it's going to take a while for people to digest this information and then connect it to defy on ethereum um because if people did make those connections we would see assets like you and it's absolutely mooting right now like if that's i think that's the case uh and the the important thing i think to take away from this whole ordeal is that you know things that are deep in the protocol sync the the protocol scene thesis that we chant about all all the time on the bankless program the things that are deep in the protocols uh sink the new things that are neutral are inherently flat they are flat landscapes for economic activity right and that flat landscape means a neutral playing field a flat playing field where no one has advantages over any others and that's what scares all the legacy institutions is because they have built systems that are not flat they have built systems that privilege themselves over their users over other people and the elites are are on the peaks when everyone else is in the troughs right and this is what ethereum can bring to the world is a loving playing playing field one of uh you know bitcoin is famously known as you know the separation of money and state and ethereum is the separation of economy and state there's no reason why the economy the quote unquote the market should be under control of robin hood or td ameritrade or anyone that can pick up a phone call make a phone call and stop canceling if if somebody has the ability to stop trading of something then the market is controlled and the market inherently does better when it's not controlled and unless and the the market the free market is not free unless it actually manifests itself on ethereum there's no other place in the world to have a free market other than ethereum yeah absolutely okay so here here's the thing i um listeners of bank list will know that we are bullish bitcoin like we like bitcoin it's a good asset but bitcoin doesn't fix this it doesn't have the answer to this problem right coinbase binance anywhere that you can purchase bitcoin today can still delist those assets with a phone call with a phone call with government regulation right so like bitcoin is one part of the d5 story but if you just stop with bitcoin maximalist and maximalism you don't get what we're talking about a censorship resistant permissionless open financial system that solves the problem of gamestop and robinhood you need something like uniswap you need money protocols in order to do this i've seen many kind of maxwellist like thought leaders say yeah bitcoin's the solution and it's like no it's not dude it's not like defy is the solution i was glad one of the the winklevoss twins said that um it's it's bitcoin ethereum and d5 without all of these things you can't actually solve what we're talking about today you need a dc we've been saying this since the beginning you need a bankless money system if you're going to have a free money system or else you get the same system that that we've already built it's just built on a different store of value new set of bosses new set of bankers that's not what we want ethereum really does solve this i david maybe you've got to comment on that but i also want to ask you about like what is it really going to take for the world to start seeing this is is the user experience just too hard on defy now is it just like for somebody who's used to robin hood and they switch over to uh to crypto and d5 and they have to do metamask and they have to do like private key management and there's gas fees on unit swap is that just all too much or what do you think the why don't why haven't we seen this influx of retail coming from the the disenfranchised wall street vets crowd well i i think one a very simple answer is to say that like gamestop's not available on ethereum like that's not where the game stopped the asset trades and so first we just need assets on ethereum that people are interested in and you know while many of these defy tokens that we are so hyped about i think are truly revolutionary they are unfamiliar to the legacy market participants who are looking to look because when wall street bets chats they're not chatting about defy tokens they're talk they're chatting about things on robin hood robin hood has actually done a terrible job adding new assets crypto assets into their platform they have a they actually have um a category in crypto assets called the ethereum family you want to know what's in there ryan yeah what's the the the ethereum family ethereum and ethereum classic oh my god terrible terrible correct correct me if i'm wrong but with robin hood david um you can't actually withdraw to uh an ether dress basically right you don't get access to your underlying what they're selling you is ious of something they can pull the same they just pulled on gamestop which is like sell your eath out from under you like take it away can't like cancel it delete it like they can pull all of that because they are purely a bank selling ious they're not selling actual ether that you can withdraw from their exchange robinhood is not the place if you're look if you're a millennial if you're a zoomer go level up on d5 yeah we're gonna need this tech for the 2020s i hope this week made it obvious we need to be leveling up on these things and i i feel like sometimes david people uh just like oh it's too it's too hard right that's not that hard yeah and you got paid twenty thousand dollars if you lose defy in 2020. what do you mean it's not hard okay so so uh your friends outside of crypto right what do you think their reaction is going to be as as a result of this so right like they're you they say something about this i know they're going to talk about this and you say yeah this is why defy exists so what's their objection to coming on board d5 what are they going to say yeah that's a good question there there is a group chat that i'm in of roughly 12 people who are defy people that are people that are defy curious but many of them come from the legacy markets and and there was just general consensus that like this pissed them off like this just riled uh riled them up uh and you know i think that's the energy that we need for people to feel um that is that energy that is motivation that's p pure motivation they're angry at something and defy allows that anger to be expressed in productive ways right we can take that that riled up energy and we can put it into the defy ecosystem um i think that the barrier to adoption and the barrier to understanding just got a lot lower you know it's a frequent phrase that we say on the bankless program that the most bullish thing about this industry is to become understood and this is one of the most exposing uh pieces of of news that has ever come across the new cycle at all right the cancelling of an asset on it on a on an exchange that's insane um i don't think there's ever going to be this one magic moment where like all of a sudden like all of wall street best is like yo let's go trade on uniswap um it's just going to be a slow trickle um but you know the like i said the the bear the the barrier is getting lower and lower and lower and it's allowing more and more water to fall over it faster and faster yeah and at the same time uh d5 is getting more and more like so the truth is if we had that influx now from wall street bets we probably like we couldn't take it i mean too many transactions gas fees would spike but at the same time ethereum d5 is developing layer two right to start to you know as other containers for this liquidity and for these users so it's almost we we also don't want it to happen all at once it's like better for it to kind of trickle in uh and uh but but look man this is like this is this is populism this is the 2020s i feel like this is not going to go away it's only if anything else it's coming from the right it's coming from the left in politics it's only going to get worse and one of the reasons david i'm in this industry and i think this is true for you is because this allows us to channel populism and this anger into something productive yeah we're not just focused on tearing it down right like because you could you could look at this and get pissed like i want to revolt i'm going to go st i want to occupy wall street i'm going to like storm the the banks i want to get the hedge funds who did this um like that's one approach the d5 the crypto approach is we're going to build a new system right that's credibly neutral and doesn't have the dependencies of the old system and all that anger that we feel we're gonna we're gonna channel that into something productive we're gonna build an entirely new financial system from the ground up right like because populism can get really ugly for human beings like famously the 1930s populism led to a world war right um that could happen here but the reason i'm in ethereum the reason i'm in define crypto is because it's a way to channel that populism into a movement that is all about building new structures and institutions for the world so it's exciting from that perspective too yeah that's exactly right something another concept that we talk about on the bank list program frequently is that before 2008 no there was no place to exit to right but yeah and then and then bitcoin came right and in 2021 in the financial crisis of 2020 and 2021 because of covid there is actually a place to exit too right there is actually a way for that populist angst and that populist energy to be expressed invented right we actually have solutions for this um to me this uh really echoes sentiments of the fourth turning concept where there is um distrust in legacy institutions no better of this more salient example of institutions canceling their customers orders against their will to profit from to make sure that the elites can can keep their money um this trust in institutions and meanwhile we are cr erecting new institutions for people to adopt instead so we are changing the guard and it's not going to happen overnight it's going to take a decade but people are looking for new institutions these days because their old institutions are failing them and there's no better more salient of example than what happened recently absolutely well this is turning into an interesting year for sure with 2020. i think this is going to be a big year for crypto a big year for the social movement that is crypto the technology that is crypto uh and probably the the the price in the bull market that is crypto right now so very exciting we're glad to have you on bangladesh david you feel like you got that out of your system man this is this is catharsis for you like i know you were angry this morning i was i was pretty angry this morning and the thing is like my one final comment on this is like there's no reason to think that this was a one-and-done the the the gamestop community or the the wall street best community just figured out that they are a force they are a fund just like just like actual funds they are a collective community of people that have the ability to allocate capital they are a dow they are a dow they are a dow they are literally a dow and they are they are only going to grow massively first off there all of them just got really rich even though some of them kind of got wrecked by by uh by robin hood people that were making the trade before the short squeeze just made massive upsides like if you were in options you could have turned a thousand dollars into twenty to fifty thousand dollars depending on your position so now they're well funded now they realize that they are a force they are more organized they are more coordinated with each other and i think that this is just going to be the first of many coordination attacks on legacy institutions like this legacy marcus i think the the this is going to be the only the first of many episodes like this to come well i can't wait for that group to uh start to get their minds wrapped around d5 and um i'm you know excited to help in any way so david this has been our roll up as always guys risks and disclaimers defy is risky eath is risky apparently so are the traditional financial markets weird but you could lose what you put in of course but this is the frontier we are headed west thanks for joining us this has been the weekly roll up from bankless
