i think is the scariest macro setup that i've seen in my 27 years in finance this is the first global sovereign debt bubble that we have had in 100 years really i think since the aftermath of world war one when you then overlay that with the second big issue you have a resource problem the marginal barrel of oil keeps getting more expensive to find bonds stocks real estate all of it implied within it with the exception of gold and bitcoin is a cheap and growing supply of of energy and what i mean by that think about it as you have a house in the suburbs your house in the suburbs is worth four hundred thousand dollars the valuation of that four hundred thousand dollars is based on gasoline being two dollars three dollars four dollars a gallon if gasoline goes to 10 or 20 dollars a gallon the 400 000 value of that house gets haircut significantly and supplies aren't really growing that much they're certainly not getting cheaper they're getting more expensive
