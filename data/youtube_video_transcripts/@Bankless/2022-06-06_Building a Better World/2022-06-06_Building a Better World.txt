i would like to see people like looking like less at their phones and more interacting with each other and less focused on their sort of hyper-financialized you know portfolios and trading and more on building up community resources and building up assets together so i would like to see just more local governance and i also i don't project anything beyond like five years like four years is too much but i think in the next five years like i would just like to see like small scale experiments with like set of populations that can help us think through the incentive challenges like i really do want to see experiments amongst like scientific communities that are naturally prone to high publicity and it's part and parcel of their job not like you know see experiments with just sort of ordinary people who don't really know what this is and and you know might like just fall into it i want to sort of be deliberate and careful and progressively build out the substrate with minimized risk and maximum sort of cooperation and consensus
