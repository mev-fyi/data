this is one of the reasons why i'm super excited about optimism because they are committed to public goods and public goods get me all hot and bothered good morning bankless nation it is the second week of january david what time is it oh ryan it's the friday weekly roll-up time where we roll up the entire week of encrypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we undertake it nonetheless because that is what we do every friday morning on the bankless friday weekly roll-up absolutely topics for the week okay inflation over seven percent that means your dollars are worth seven percent this year versus last year seven percent less did i say more you just got seven percent it's seven percent less that's bad okay paypal doing a stablecoin what's the news on that we're also going to talk about this uh airdrop from looks rare i got my look token books token did you get yours oh i got my looks all right finally it looks bright like this is like an open c competitor we're gonna dig into that maybe it's what we've been looking for not sure yet there's some other airdrops we're going to touch too also some big nft winners this week and some losers what are the winning projects what are the losers last two unpack on the roll-up uh and you are freshly back david you're you're back from your ice climbing trip how was that man uh well i didn't die so so that's right uh he's been a big rock climber but never been ice climbing before and i've have i've had this like bad ass afterglow for the last week of just you know yo i doing ice climbing that's amazing are we gonna show those pictures like toward the end of the show oh yeah yeah that was pretty badass hanging on with one arm while i'm taking a selfie yeah you will never see me up there with you dude but like i admire i admire what you're doing yeah that's very cool um also we gotta tell you a little bit about our friends and sponsors at on juno david tell them what on juno is on juno is a checking account for crypto people so if you're frustrated that your boomer bank account doesn't have usdc or eth or btc when it totally could use on juno because on juno is a crypto enabled checking account you can put usdc in there you can also get four percent on that usdc uh ryan how much apy do you get on your deposits in your in your bank account okay i know this uh point zero one percent in my wells fargo way to save account yeah that's significantly less than the four percent that you can get yes it is juno also significantly less than inflation i also prefer this uh and in addition to that you can also get your direct deposit from your company sent into your onjuno account and they will automatically convert that into crypto so you can reduce the amount of time that you hold your inflating dollars and it can get sent directly into actual sound real money like bitcoin and ether you can do a number of other cool things they have a metal debit card for you where you can get like five percent cash back at select uh web 2 type companies uh walmart comes to mind uh spotify stuff like that uh and just a bunch of other features as well so uh if your bank account if your boomer bank account has not taken the crypto pill on juno has uh so you can go and sign up with code bankless to get fifty dollars when you get your first direct deposit into your onjuno account yeah i've never seen a bank account that can do this this is uh my on juno account look at this you can get started split your paycheck and you get to pick whether you are a bitcoin maximalist and eth maximalist or something in the middle uh really cool features that on juno is rolling out so make sure you guys check that out and get an account there is a link in the show notes uh david let's start with some market news of the week uh gets the numbers man bitcoin first how is bitcoin hanging in there in the second week of january 2022. yeah so the big red days were last week really literally eight days ago so these seven days of price action has actually not been terrible even though we've kind of had like a bad market so bitcoin is actually up one percent since like monday right yeah it started though it started and also like there's we kind of we simply record these on thursdays but the weeks end on sundays there's a little bit of discrepancy we have to sort that out anyways uh seven days ago the bitcoin price was forty three thousand dollars it hit a low of forty and a half thousand dollars in the middle of the week we are currently clocking in at forty four oh 42 800 uh so actually since i wrote these numbers down we must have taken a little bit of a dip because we were actually down 1.8 percent so scratch that uh down 1.8 percent who knows what it'll be at the time of recording of course pretty choppy pretty volatile but definitely it's been down in 2022 so far same story for eth what are we looking at on the week yeah eth started the week at 3 400 which was the high of the week it hit a low of just below three thousand dollars didn't stay below three thousand dollars for too long um we don't we don't like that three thousand number that's that's too low of a number i hate that number uh three thousand i'll settle for three thousand three hundred but we are below three thousand three 300 right now at 3 286. what happened was that um uh the last wednesday a week ago wednesday the fed minutes came out and people realized that the fed is now are now looking at reducing their balance sheet which means that they are going from injecting 120 million dollars billion dollars per month into the market to pulling out 80 billion dollars so a 200 billion dollar month difference in liquidity that spooked a lot of people especially risk on assets like crypto assets uh and that was because of perceived just like unsustainable nature of the balance sheet uh and so and also inflation uh and so that's what spooked the market that's why the market's down and then on wednesday when we went from a price of like 3100 to 3400 over the course of 24 hours that is when uh the cpi came out and inflation wasn't worse than expected and so people uh said okay it's not couldn't couldn't have been worse than this so i'm gonna go a little bit more risk on uh so markets went from like four thousand down to three thousand because of the fed notes and then bounced back from three thousand up to three thousand four hundred with ether price um but since i wrote these numbers down we are back down to 3 290 on the ether price bitcoin doing similar things so that is the tl dr of the last week in crypto prices yeah macro really taking center stage in the crypto markets and you know jerome palin's it's like that that 120 billion dollars that they're buying every month right that's kind of like an asset um yeah asset stimulus program it's a price floor it's a pro it's a price floor exactly and you know that goes into all risk on assets so i i think there's that compounded with the fact that people are wondering does the fed really know what it's doing are they really in control anymore or a couple of roll-ups ago i call this like the jesus take the wheel economy it's like no one actually is steering this ship and you know is the fed really on top of things are they just reacting to things just like everyone else i think that's given uh some jitters to the market and that's going to take some time i think to work itself out so i don't know what's going to happen for the rest of uh q1 uh but um i i think this macro stuff could be in the headlines for a while david yeah i think that's right the actions of the fed are similarly as volatile as the markets themselves so it's not really helping anyone all right let's look at the eighth bitcoin ratio uh so our numbers for bitcoin and eth are flat on the week is the ratio looking pretty flat too yeah the ratio is up from point zero seven five two point zero seven six seven up a tiny little bit but still down on the like a on a four week trend uh about four weeks ago we almost hit point zero nine we are currently at point zero seven six um i would like to be above .08 uh i've said it uh in episodes past uh and so i'll have to say it again like the btc ratio going up is an indication of the bull market it's been going down the last four weeks i don't like that uh if it's not an indication of a bull market it's an indication of a bear market uh so i'll have to be fair to myself and say that um uh it's still pretty good though yeah 0.076 not not too bad hanging in there not knowing what to do it's kind of like it reminds me of the summer we back to crab season right for this quarter it might be a crab season quarter see how that plays out how about the bed index that is bitcoin eath and defy tokens all combine a third or third a third on the one week what are we looking at yeah we started the week at 126 we are ending the week at 128. we are up by about 2.4 percent 2.4 percent on the week uh interesting you know let's switch maybe to uh away from way from the short-term chop and back to uh to fundamentals so i i tweeted this out david earlier this year like uh and this is kind of it earlier this week rather this is kind of a joke but like i'd rather sell an organ than sell my eat this year because it's a merge year all right will someone take my kidney for eath i don't know you could tokenize it if anyone needs my kidney i got i got an o plus or oh blood type o let me know let me know you only need one yeah so like but but seriously the fundamentals for ether as an asset and i think for for other assets in crypto are looking quite strong and now we're talking about the burn the furnaces is quite hot this week 18k burn record in a 24 hour period of time that happened on january 10th earlier this week the biggest eath burn in a single day pretty impressive there we got some other things on the burn uh why don't you talk about this david yeah for seven days we had no net new ether issuance we had a day where ether issuance was matched by ether byrne and actually this uh tweet is actually a little bit outdated the issuance offset point 1.00 is actually the last time i checked it was 1.02 so we actually burned two percent more ether than we issued so ether supply didn't increase this week yes it's what you're saying yes and this doesn't happen with any other blockchains never ever um and this this is uh as likely because of volatility one of the first articles actually i think the first article i ever wrote was an analysis of mkr getting burnt during times of market volatility and i noticed that a lot of mkr gets burnt when prices go up and down really really quickly totally because people are paying back their debt into uh maker dow and that burns mkr and now we are seeing the same dynamic play out where market volatility creates congestion on the blockchain people are getting liquidated there are arbitrage bots all over the place people need to cover their positions people need to do defy stuff when prices move and so when that happens congestion on the chain goes goes really really high and so during times of market volatility ether gets burnt the most and so we definitely saw that with there was definitely a decent number of liquidations um on saturday and sunday of last week and that is being reflected in how much ether we are burning uh so market volatility ultimately burns more ether it's definitely some of that and and at the same time open c uh activity like hasn't slowed down either so you've got both the market volatility causing people to click more buttons on d5 and then you have open c and nft is going full steam ahead that that all adds up to a lot of burn perfectly balanced as all things should be is the uh thanos meme reference here um this is a whole uh review of 2021 the top ethereum gas consumers and you can see the big ones here what came in number one david yeah you for the viewers on the youtube you can watch these graphs uh the bottom is going to be the biggest and then you can see the bands get highlighted as we move up uh this is alex svanovic from nansen uh and so una swap coming in at number one burning like what looks like 40 percent yeah 40 riff roughly of all gas in 2021 uh so that's pretty big definitely taking up the majority uh followed by open c and you can see just the rate of adoption and open sea where even though it's number two it actually didn't burn all that much gas in the first half of the year of 2021 it was all in the second half and from the period of like august to november open sea was actually burning more ether than uniswap unit swap or consuming gas i guess is the more technical term so that's number two followed three by one inch which had a nice steady gas consumption all throughout the year number four is the wrapped ether contract so that's wrapped ether being transferred around that wrapped easier okay quick uh dive into rapid ether why does wrapped ether exist uh because ether is not an erc20 token and d5r is used to erc 20 tokens so just to make ether be on the same page as all the other tokens we use in defy we have this rapper contract called wrapped ether people put their ether in there and then boom ether behaves like an ert20 token and wrapped ether coming in number four at the most burned in 2021 followed by tether coming in at number five gonna blew up blow throughout the rest of these usc at number six uh ave at number seven zero x xerox exchange and matcha coming in at number eight uh number nine is metamask swap and number ten is sushi swap so there you have it there are our top 10 eth gas consumers in 2021 yeah pretty cool d5 and nft is definitely the story this is a visual from token terminal let me see if i can uh expand this blow this up a little bit of eth becoming a productive asset so this is the effect of eip 1559 visualized i'm playing this now so you can see transaction fees to miners if you're on youtube looking at this in the aqua and then suddenly eip1559 kicks in burn transaction fees oh look look about to hit it like it surpasses transaction fees to miners the nice thing about these burn transaction fees of course is they go to all eth holders so it's kind of like a um a stock buyback type pro program if you're thinking about this in terms of uh you know capital assets like stocks or something like that wait but before you go on i want to elaborate on that point because the number of miners out there are like you know not that many like less than a thousand uh individuals or entities are capturing like 95 percent of the value of the transaction fees going to miners the number of ether holders out there is far more than that it's over a million people so we're going from like just a thousand people who receive the benefit of ethereum transaction fees going to over a million people that's one of the beautiful things about eip1559 it democratizes the value captured by the ethereum protocol to the maximum number of people possible that's also aligned with the ethereum protocol which is ether holder so this is a democratizing force yeah it's interesting too it i mean this this doesn't go to whales disproportionately it goes to everyone equally so you you want some of this the benefits of the stock buy back you can just own some eath you can have a fraction of the eath and and you receive this benefit uh it's pretty cool one of my predictions for me this is kind of a hot take for 2022 is um the ethereum merge will happen this year and historically it'll be like it'll be a historic milestone in the whole you know history of crypto that's how it'll be viewed in the decades to come but when it does happen in a few months time to time people will still be disappointed because there's this idea david that eth2 and the merge will actually reduce gas fees and that's not what's going to happen it's it's almost like a efficiency improvement it's a monetary policy improvement right you're ripping out the old proof of work engine and you're installing this this hyper efficient electric engine so we've gone from a combustion engine to an electric engine but it is not going to alleviate gas fees and i'm worried there's this sentiment that people think oh when the merge happens suddenly gas fees on ethereum will go away that's not what's going to happen that is not ethereum's scalability strategy so i guess a quick psa for people who didn't realize that and also the take there is um i think some people will be disappointed because there's a lot of bad information about what's going to happen in the future with ethereum's roadmap any thoughts there now i've i had that same question uh while i was on a podcast uh the other this this week where like what's going to happen to the gas fees after the merge i don't know where that excuse me i don't know where that misunderstanding came from um i've never heard that be iterated i think people just assume that e2 has low gas fees and it kind of does with sharding that's that's the part where ethereum block space actually grows is because a lot of bad information out there it's like it's look to be fair it's hard to keep track of all of this stuff and sometimes we use all sorts of like technical terms you have to kind of be in the weeds like eip1559 like what is that what does that even mean eth2 oh it sounds like an upgrade is the upgrade going to be faster well no it's not like what does it improve it's complicated so i get it but yeah i'm not sure why that sentiment has uh has somewhat spread the interesting thing about all of this is somebody actually put together a uh discounted cash flow model that i thought was really neat oh wow this is amazing in the show notes yeah it's it's pretty cool right so this is how analysts uh analyze this is done by ryan alice this is a discount on cash flow it's how analysts look at capital assets like stocks or you know rental properties that sort of thing and what's interesting about this is if you just look at it from a amount of revenue that goes to eth as a productive asset once staking kicks in right the value the fair market value of eth if it has a p e ratio something that would be common for a fast growing you know tech company of 100 then eth is massively undervalued it should be valued at close to 12 dollars per per eth just because this thing is a revenue machine all right um it's december 2021 revenue was 13 billion dollars wow and remember what we said so like the eip 1559 all of those burn metrics that we're going back that's stock buybacks okay but basically when the merge happens and you stake your eth then you not only receive the stock buyback but you also receive a dividend you also receive uh uh annual you know staking revenue rewards the the fees that are currently paid to minors go to validators the leftovers from the burn go to the validators who stake their eth so that effectively is like a dividend so that's what's happening right now with ether and if you just value it as a productive asset uh it just seems hilariously undervalued at this point in time i know bankless listeners are probably sick of us saying that but like hey we're gonna make this drum until until it happens just look at the numbers okay just look at the numbers for yourself check out this discounted cash flow and this is only if you view ether as a productive asset as a capital asset when you add a monetary premium right so like as a productive asset it's worth two trillion dollars uh but if you if you consider that you should also have a monetary premium for all of its uses as money collateral and defy uh like what else are you gonna hold you're gonna hold sovereign bonds no you want you want a long-term store of value i mean that feels like a four trillion dollar five trillion dollar evaluation right i have no idea if that's going to happen this year but these are just the fundamentals that i think you and i see when we look at ethers and asset and why we talk about it so much because it just seems like a freaking no-brainer right it really does it really does i mean it can't just teleport to its fair evaluation right because then there's too many people that got too rich too quickly so they got to sell so there's many dynamics about why it's not at that price but uh one of those dynamics about why it's not at that price is time and so bankless will be here talking about this until that time comes it's just the most fundamentally strong asset in this space in the world in best asset the universe has ever seen well now we're being too bullish but uh yeah it's uh it seems like a massive opportunity all right let's talk about uniswap on polygon so it's going pretty well david what's happening here yeah so we've been covering this lately where uh there was a proposal to put unit swap on polygon it passed with overwhelming support uh so now it's there uh and it's only been a few weeks tweets hayden adams since launch and uniswap v3 is already the highest volume deck protocol on polygon with only 45 million tv l2 this is one of the beautiful things about unit swap v3 it's super capital efficient you can get a lot of liquidity with not that much capital at being provided in liquidity and so no surprise that unit swap comes to polygon and just dominates in the dex space so congrats to uniswap congrats to polygon uh congrats to d5 and layer two it's thrown off some serious revenue here too so in 2021 uniswap lps this is the liquidity providers they made 1.6 billion dollars worth of revenue and hayden says that's more than any app any decentralized app d5 protocol l1 network or l2 network aside from ethereum the king itself pretty impressive uh he also shows six other projects that are direct v2 forks of uniswaps the uniswap amm model working pretty well generating a ton of revenue for the space and the the highlight about this revenue this 1.6 billion dollars in revenue is going to liquidity providers who never did any kyc who never filled out a form who never signed up with anything this is permissionless revenue so yes it's 106 or 1.6 billion dollars but in my mind it's the best kind of 1.6 billion dollars which is the permissionless and free kind where no one had to submit any sort of documentation to access it it's the best kind of revenue how old is uniswap is this like uh just november 2019 four okay so three just you know three years old just over three years yep uh incredible how fast these protocols can grow uh another growth story from a market perspective crypto browser the brave browser just passed 50 million monthly active users of course brave just launched a crypto wallet as well this is a more crypto native browser and pretty cool pretty impressive to see that growth yeah um this is not strictly crypto because brave brave is just a privacy it's a crypto ethos browser where you get friendly crypto friendly yeah you get to control your digital footprint it's user first it's user sovereignty so very aligned with crypto values and then they do have their brand new um wallet in the browser as well which you've heard of from the bankless ads so you'll hear about that later in the show guys speaking of bankless ads they're about to come at you we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible we'll be back with the releases and the rest of the roll up in just a minute the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 50 million monthly active users control your digital footprint with built-in privacy and ad blocking inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the first secure crypto wallet built natively inside of a web 3 crypto browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web3 your crypto wallet the brave wall is different bravewall is built natively inside the brave browser no extension required which gives the brave wallet an extra level of security versus other wallets with the brave wallet you can buy store send and swap your crypto assets and it can even manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps all from the security of the best privacy browser on the market whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned pro it's time to switch to the brave wallet download brave at brave.com bank list and click the wallet icon to get started when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap your swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswopgrants.org and help steer you swap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right guys we are back with the releases of the week we gotta start here with an airdrop and a release a combo double threat looks rare they just released this is a vampire attack on openc an nft trading platform an nft listing platform minting platform you do a lot of things with looks rare uh what's going on here yeah this is kind of i i think this might be the openc alternative that we've all been looking for there's definitely some very viable alternatives zora comes to mind uh like you know uh wearable you know foundation but like everyone's really looking for that that search and organization and curation feature that opencv really has done a very good job off and looksrare.org is a brand new app on the scene web3 app with uh that is closer towards the web 3 end of the spectrum than uh than open c open c is kind of you know to a web 2.5 and also i think people have just finally swallowed the pill that open seas i don't think is going to be doing a token um and so people really want an nfc platform that they can own which means they need a token and this platform came with token first so they airdropped the looks token to anyone that has put three ether of volume through open c so if you've ever bought anything more than three ether or collected uh collectively purchase anything more than three ether threw up and see you have the looks token we'll pull up a chart here in a second because that number actually scales up the more volume that you put through three is just the minimum uh in order to get your airdrop you must list an nft for sale so you are not automatically eligible you have to actually list an nft that you own for sale on the looks for air platform but there's some pretty interesting tokenomics and this is there were angel investments i'm not sure if there was a big vc uh profile behind this but there were angel investors so there is investors in this it's not like uh the immaculate nature of ens where they have absolutely no investors uh there are some investors behind this um uh but uh i think so far like it's been very very well received by the community a lot of the friends that i've heard chit chat about this or are excited about it uh and i think that i've i went through and i listed uh the the two air drops uh i got i got the airdrop twice two different wallets and i've listed two nfts and that process was great uh very sleek uh ui um we did ask the the looks for our team to come on the state of the nation but since they are all anons and they are also very busy with the launch they politely declined which is totally fine um but maybe we will talk to them in the future yeah that's really cool and i guess a vampire attack part of this right so like last episode i feel like we were just talking about openc almost a good chunk of that episode it's because openc just raised 20 billion dollars and at that point if you issue a token i mean a lot of the gains have already been realized by accredited investors the vc side of things in this case the vampire attack piece of it is basically they went through they got all of the higher volume open seat users and they said hey you can take part in our equity in our economy we're issuing a token we're giving that to you and i believe david there's some like uh staking incentives here so the revenue open c of course collects 2.5 percent of all trading fees right on the open c platform looks rare collects two percent of that and then is it somehow staked is it somehow distributed to people who are staking the looks token is that how this works that's exactly right and ryan you just said that opencv raised 30 billion dollars that not not quite uh they raised uh 30 300 million dollars at a 13 billion dollar valuation they did not raise 30 billion dollars did i say 30 billion or you did okay i don't even know what i okay they raised 300 million at a 13 billion dollar valuation and yeah and yes they charge a 2.5 percent each uh fee on the sales and that goes into the open c company uh instead uh with looks rare they charge two percent uh and that goes to people that are staking their looks token and uh if you actually you can go into the rewards page on the looks rare.com website ryan and it'll tell you the apy which is insane 930 apr on your looks tokens and this is not a pool too this is not coming from uh actually maybe maybe there is maybe there actually is some inflation uh but you are not providing liquidity on this so you are not getting like you can people can't dump on you it's not pool too so that's a very strong percentage of apr and this is a combination of uh uh yes this must be because i'm staking my looks token and i'm watching that number go up so you get more looks token when you stake so there is some inflation there and then you also get wrapped ether you get wrapped ether in your wallet and ryan i tweeted this out earlier today uh just some of the metrics of 24 hours worth of staking on the airdrop that i got and i don't know if you have that tweet up but let's see if we can let's see if you can uh if you do yeah so 24 hours into staking looks i got 21 new looks tokens which is about 100 and .024 east which is about 80 in reward so about 180 dollars inside of 24 hours on my airdrop the airdrop that i got when i claimed it it was 4.2 uh thousand dollars for the airdrop and then because uh appreciation is now up to seven thousand dollars uh and so i kind of it's it's a pretty compelling airdrop it's amazing and it's like so you're earning your those earnings are denominated in eve too it's really hard to find like denominated earnings yes this is an application that is sending out ether for dividends towards its users on day one so that is in of itself like a brand like a kind of a breakthrough this is something i've always wanted also no wonder they're anonymous because i can imagine there could be some uh securities like sec type concerns with this type of an arrangement but i'm glad they're like moving the overton window in its favor what is the value of the looks token here david yeah so the the last i checked it at when the looks token was i think four point eight dollars per token uh four dollars eighty cents uh it was valued at roughly 4.2 billion dollars 4.2 billion dollars on day one is like a lot it's a lot that's a that's a that's a big number uh that's very strong that's very strong returns for all of those angel investors who invested i don't know what valuation but i'm wasn't a billion dollars i can be sure uh so you know this is already like a pretty highly valued token uh so you know buyer buyer beware uh but the hey you know open c competition air drop though yeah you got it definitely pick up your airdrop yeah ryan do you have that chart of the different um uh air drops uh tears if not i can just read it out um where would that be would that be i can just read it out yeah read it out okay so like i said the lowest here is that if you uh ascent three ether through um through openc you get 125 looks tokens and again looks tokens is trading about four point five dollars three to six to ten ether you get 200 it looks tokens 10 to 20 ether you get 400 looks tokens 25 to 35 you get 800 looks tokens so you can you can um you know extrapolate from there there will be a link in the show notes to check that out and overall there's a decent bell curve distribution so the biggest the people that spent the most uh through uh looks rare who spent over a thousand ether through openc those collectively those people got 4.5 million tokens but the the biggest tier were people that spent between 35 and 120 ether through open c and collectively those people got about 35 000 uh looks tokens combined so it's impressive man it's impressive look and they also shipped a product like day one with the airdrop which is super impressive and i think we're going to see this as a trend in 2022 like we've seen a little bit last year but you'll have kind of a i guess a more closed less community owned type of application like say an open c for example and then i think in 2022 what we'll see is a fork of that a vampire attack of that this is not a fourth they didn't steal open c's code but like similar concept except rather than vc owned and kind of going public route it'll be community owned that's exactly what we're seeing i think we'll see this repeat again and again and again in 2022 so it always pays to use crypto applications doesn't it i mean all you had to do in order to be eligible is like definitely three ethers uh a decent amount of volume out of t but all you had to do is do that and use openc and you got some free money crypto pays you to learn about crypto as we say so often uh really cool trend to see there's another airdrop here david uh a wtf a fees.wtf airdrop people might know this website as the website that you don't want to go look at when you look at how much money you've spent on gas well is this your account did you really spend 2.5 million dollars i'm not spending 2.5 million on gas this is something random this is some random address but uh at the time of recording this contract unlocks in about six hours so you it will already be unlocked by the time that you listen to this no clue what the token does uh unless i i i have no clue why they need a token why do we need a token for how much gas you've spent i don't know maybe they actually plan to do something of it one of the big reasons why i haven't sold my looks tokens is because i'm staking it and it's giving me ether uh the only way that i know that i can get ether from this new fees.wtf airdrop is by selling it for ether what is your purpose you you get sold for ether that is just my personal take that is perhaps what i'm doing until i see anything further about air drops people can do whatever they want with them if you you know spend the time to research this project then you can hold if you don't then just sell or you could stake in some cases maybe there's something that people know that i don't and maybe i should be much more bullish on it but until then selling it for eth by the way on that on that trend of looks rare here's a community owned wallet for the open internet this looks like it's uh maybe trying to take the metamask play and create a community-owned version of metamask the wallet is called tally at tally.cash what do you make of this yeah free open source software kind of true to the nature of you know crypto which is free and open source um uh they they do take a swing at metamask for having a license on it but you know can you really blame them uh for having license some people can i guess uh this wallet does uh definitely interested in seeing more and more competition in the wallet space uh and so i'm excited to try this out i have not yet tried it out yeah these wars between sort of community owned versus vc owned the net result of them there's like mud back and forth and like there's all sorts of noise about it but the end result is consumers get better products and the industry moves forward faster so i'm all about it bring on the competition let's go love it uh this is pretty cool too index co-op in partnership with bankless dow they just released a new index called the gmi gonna make it index what's in the gmi index david what is this thing yeah a bunch of the newer tokens that aren't in the dpi and i think that's really what this angle of the gmi token is a lot of newer defy projects have moved faster than what the parameters of the dpi index allow for inclusion with so there's a bunch of tokens in here that are not in dpi things like toke from tokamak maple finance cvx perp from perpetual protocol uh spell tribe uh flx from reflexer a bunch of different stuff also a very balanced index there's nothing really with that has really too much outsized um outside proportion of it so bankless dial just churning out the products yeah the streaming fees 1.95 so 1.95 percent of the market cap of the gmi index goes splits between the bankless dow and index co-op uh and bankless doubt uh got two products on the index co-op as index both the bad index of which we talked about and the gmi index uh so kind of taking the lead without using index co-op to churn out some awesome indices yeah it's pretty cool good to see more indices enter the market too um let's talk about uh let's talk about this next thing which is ether scan man there's not a day that goes by that uh i don't use etherscan and i'm not always thankful you know i don't always think about it but um because it's just like become second nature to me it's like kind of like google but uh it is the most useful tool it's crazy crypto crazy useful now they're adding some more features so this is an nft feature so it allows for the on-chain nft like you can track trading and minting in etherscan's new nft tracker what are we looking at here david it's just a ui ux upgrade um people you can already see when you're trading nfts but now you can see what nfts so just a small might medium ux increase improvement to ether scan which they're always shipping and it's crazy how good etherscan has been even before defy was like good like like etherscan was a good product before anything else on ethereum was a good product i don't know what would happen if ether scan went down like i would be inside myself either ether blocks or io just doesn't doesn't have it let's talk uh some lt releases we're going to burn through some of these immutable is now permissionless so it used to be permission used to have to fill out some paperwork in order to get on immutable now you don't anyone can enter the theme park is open anyone can set up a ride and they're doing some serious volume here too so they've just hit a thousand test contracts that are registered on immutable x uh in just two months the number has skyrocketed 4x so insane growth for immutablex seriously impressed with their traction yeah the this is what happens when you have free nft fees this is the beautiful beauty of layer two stuff space it's free block space yeah it's free real estate it's free real estate zk roll ups are just pure magic and this is why ryan and i are just harping on layer twos is because layer twos is where you get the fastest and most free kind of transactions and immutable is definitely getting the adoption based off of that so congratulations dydx also based on layer two of course using the zika software technology ck layer two really cool advanced stuff feels like a centralized exchange but it's not and now they are fully decentralizing there's a whole blog post about this that we'll include in the show notes but i think the line is they are planning to in v4 their newest launch by the end of 2022 be fully decentralized in the implementation of the dydx protocol so that means no central party has the ability to receive fees on v2 or v4 it will just be the dydx token holders i believe and the parameters of which governance kind of you know sets what those trading fees actually are i'd love to pick their brain about uh you know the nuances of this like what about the front end is the front end still going to be centralized things like a liquidy uh protocol have done a fantastic job incentivizing other front ends uh when we say fully decentralized are we also talking about the front end and what about the other components of decentralization but they are doing what we like to see which is decentralizing moving that direction is always great to see we will always support it all about that at bankless tons of stuff going on with optimism dude optimism had a killer week you want you want to burn through these ron yeah so they went permissionless they opened up their doors to the theme park for all applications the third week of december now one month later what are we seeing here david oh gosh matcha is now on optimism so one of the most used dex aggregators is on optimism so congrats to matcha we also have tornado cash so if you have a doxed wallet and you want to regain your privacy tornado cash on the ethereum l1 is pretty like gas intensive it requires a lot of computation to do it to do its duty so it makes much more sense to be on optimism so tornado cache now on optimism if you want to undox yourself you can bridge your eth over to optimism and use tornado cash there for much reduced fees set protocol also now on optimism uh the ogs will remember set protocol it was a big topic during the the bear market 2018 2019 uh they they are one of the teams that is responsible for helping index co-op spin off and so that's definitely where some of their energies have been oh since then being kind of quiet but they are now on optimism with their token sets uh so check that out um and and also in addition to that optimism uh all of these like all sequencers of layer twos people that produce blocks they just like on the ethereum one they take they can take transaction fees and mev uh and that's this is a very significant conversation to be had because of so many different things that are related to who gets the money that our value extracted from player twos and optimism as a part of just its ethos its values is giving away all of its profits to donate it towards public goods so in the last year optimum optimism of all the adoption has had is is you know sending out the blocks sequencing the blocks which is eventually going to be decentralized um but last year they donated one million dollars to open source projects on ethereum and then they finish up saying over the course of hashtag l22 layer 2 2022 we'll be giving away significantly more so this is one of the reasons why i'm super excited about optimism because they are committed to public goods and public goods get me all hot and bothered me too david and of course like all roll-ups they're speeding up so uh fees on optimism just got a nice uh reduction so uh more incremental improvements going on all the time in up land transaction fee is now 30 percent cheaper than last week and that will continue to happen as well um we're also seeing some applications go to alternative layer ones too this is zerion deploying on avalanche so you can now track and trade all your avalanche assets directly on xerion cool to see them expanding as well uh last thing in all of these layer twos this is really cool there's now a fiat on ramp so you have the ability to buy crypto directly on a layer 2 in your argent wallet of course argent switched from main chain to zk sync which is a zk roll up and again some of these terms you know mainstream by the time this is fully ready for mainstream they won't have to worry about any of it right it's like they don't care about zk rollups or you know zk sync or any smart contract wallets for that matter they'll just see oh cool here's an app super easy to use i can deposit directly from my bank account and now i can use cool defy stuff which is not inflating away at seven percent per year and gives me a higher interest rate than point zero one percent in my wells fargo bank account so i'm just going to click some buttons and make that happen that's how the mainstream experience will will feel and i feel like we're getting closer to that all the time all right no one these days says i'm going to go log into the world wide web using my tcpip like that's not what we talk about there's a take later on in the show well we'll unpack that a little bit more absolutely uh some raises maybe the only one to highlight this week not really a raise it was an acquisition but coinbase bought this company called fair x to launch crypto derivatives i've not heard of of fair x but coinbase getting into the crypto derivatives market i think is a big move i guess maybe derivatives are ready for coinbase they've been holding back ftx's of the world the binances of the world have outstripped them recently uh hopefully coinbase plans to uh to catch up a little bit i guess that's probably their plan with this acquisition so that is happening as well uh anything else on that david yeah ftx really putting the fire under coinbase ftx gets their name on on the miami heat arena and then boom what does coinbase do uh they they get a partnership with uh the nba i think and then uh ftx signs on uh something like tom brady and then boom what does coinbase do i think they got steph curry uh and then and uh you know ftx really big on crypto derivatives boom what does coinbase do acquires ledger or fair x uh so this is why competition is always good for the consumer absolutely totally i mean i i think this battle will play out in the years to come there'll be two titans clashing in this way um but you don't have to get involved or you could you could go get a job in crypto on our job sport that's the bankless dot palette dot xyz job board now is the time 2022 it's the beginning of 2022 you're probably evaluating things probably have some new year's resolutions you're trying to keep maybe one of those things is to get a job in crypto crypto is always hiring all right we are in still a secular bull run we will be for the next decade there are lots of opportunities to plug in here's a senior full-time if you don't have enough crypto and you want more the best thing you can do is get more exposure to crypto by working in crypto absolutely i you know some of these positions probably come with token upside as well uh senior full stack engineer at syneca there's a senior software engineer at gilded there is a founding full stack engineer at utopia labs a community ecosystem lead at dydx as well that's all we have time to highlight a ton more on the bankless job board so go ahead and check that out i don't have to dance that long today [Laughter] guys uh news time david do you want to start with the cpi story i know we alluded to it but like cpi that's consumer price index so your shelter your groceries like the stuff you you know the stuff that you pay for in your everyday life has just gone up seven percent over the past year it's the highest inflation has been since 1982. we all remember like parents people in our lives talking about the 1970s being crazy for inflation well we're starting to see it again transitory inflation not so transitory what's uh what's happening here yeah inflation clocking in at seven percent which is crazy and and i think i actually want to start with a little anecdote that i remember during the 2019-2020 era of defy there was a time where there were multiple years two plus years where maker dao had a zero percent or point five percent interest rate stability fee is what they call interest rate on their die so it was extremely cheap to borrow die all you would have to do is deposit ether into maker dow you could borrow die basically for free and that's because the the die uh was always pegged to the dollar pretty damn well and as soon as the bull market hit the die started to lose its peg and so it went from one dollar down to 98 cents down to 96 cents it got even as low as 94 cents because the ether price kept on going up and up and up and up and up uh and so in your brain think s p going up right like the the market goes up there's more capital in the market and when there's more capital people can borrow more and die is minted when more people borrow more by depositing more ether and so when ether doubles they have the same amount of ether but you can borrow twice as much so the die supply just got out of control and so maker dial started to like increase their stability fees they went from point five percent to one point five percent then they went to two point five percent and then the diaper got even worse it got down like 92 cents and so like roone had called maker dow governance and she's like yo guys i think we might need to be really really aggressive with the interest rate like i'm thinking like perhaps plus above 10 percent in order to restore the peg that they had the maker down governance had to increase the stability fee up to 19.5 percent before the die peg got back down to a dollar and this is kind of a similar mandate that the fed has the fed has a demand for price stability where maker dow pegs their die stably to the us dollar the us dollar just needs to be pegged towards a basket of goods and right now it's not being pegged towards a basket of goods because however inflation is seven percent so there's a nice little anecdote about how defy works and how it's kind of the same in the the traditional world and i think that's what's going on here i think the fed had a moment in the last few weeks where they realized that like yo it's not going to take like a marginal increase in interest rates like it's going to take an aggressive increase in interest rates to combat inflation and so that's i think why part part of the story of why the markets are down this week and what why people are freaking out because people see the fret the fed people are freaking out because they see the fed freaking out about how high the interest the inflation is and so they are projecting high interest rates in order to combat that inflation and they have to do this without breaking the economy which is the tight walk that the fed has to uh has to walk and it's pretty tricky but like for for the average person i mean you look at seven percent and this just looks broken i mean have did you get a seven percent raise this year oh if not then you actually lost money you got like uh you know a real term yeah you're earning less than you were last year in real time we're talking about bet your bank accounts right they call it a savings account and they give you 0.01 interest that's just embarrassing how how does a bank even call it a savings account when you're losing 7 per year you can't possibly make that up on the interest so this starts to feel like a broken economy and i think people are looking to the fed to uh to get a hold of this it's not just the fed's responsibility right like fiscal policy comes into play here anyway it's going gonna be a interesting decade as we watch some of these dynamics around money supply playing out but uh this is the case for crypto isn't it i mean crypto people have been saying that this would happen for a while and uh and here it is sorry sorry if people didn't like the buzzer um i thought it was funny i like the buzzer good buzzer david yeah this was uh it's coming this is a good post um first impressions of web3 this is somebody from the the signal application i believe kind of a founder or someone involved in that project which is a great privacy-centric messaging application uh and i don't know what what did you make of this article when you read it david yeah this is the the takeaway was that um while these foundations the blockchains may be decentralized themselves and some some things on them may also be decentralized like defy things up the stack are less decentralized and so the take is like yo we have these decentralized base layers but like the things on a lot of the things on top of them are not decentralized and this goes into the question of like where does the data for your jpeg actually live is that on a blockchain because like if you're if your jpeg's any more than a very small file size uh the answer is no very very few nfts actually have the image stored on on chain uh and that's actually why things like auto glyphs out of uh larva labs are so popular fun fact crypto punks are actually on the ethereum blockchain but the average nft does not have the data on the blockchain and that's just one example of how there is centralization worked into different spots around the web 3 world and that was the critique out of moxie here just parts parts of the applications that we use aren't decentralized they are sensorable uh they have uh weak attack vectors and so the critique is like yo what is this webview thing if it's if it has all these potential attack vectors uh what's your take around yeah i i think he brings up a good point something we've we've known for a while and it's you know it's not just like the the image themselves and the storage isn't decentralized but actually like accessing the jpeg is also uses uh apis from centralized companies so if openc went away for for instance did you know you probably wouldn't be able to see the nft in your metamask wallet at least for some period of time because metamask and many of the different wallets they just call openc for that indexing data to tell them which nft is what my take here is that uh i think he raises some good points but that also the crypto industry is not unaware of these things and he might not appreciate the um the extent to which like we're working on them and the extent to which um like we're taking them seriously this was a a post from vitalik who just actually commented on moxie's post uh and you know he said he said this this stuck out at me because one of the things moxie said is like oh if you're going to call the space decentralized why hasn't it actually become decentralized why hasn't it happened yet vitalik said this as far as my theory as for my theory about why this hasn't happened yet i would say a lot of it comes down to limited technical resources and funding it's easier to build things this lazy centralized way and it takes serious effort to do it right the ethereum ecosystem did not have that much resources up until four years ago and i think that is really the theme or probably the response from the crypto community it's basically like yeah you know we're taking some we're using some web 2 infrastructure we have to take some you know temporary shortcuts and centralize things that long term we want to decentralize but we are working to decentralize them over time vitalik gets into some more technical details about how light clients can actually prove uh to be a better more decentralized uh kind of access layer for some of these things and also the work that you know the graph is doing for example as an indexer to decentralize itself so it's kind of a work in progress i feel like this was a a good critique um definitely good reminder elements of truth and also that we're still early in the crypto industry uh at least the the parts that that we love the most are working on these things to start decentralizing them over time yeah i 100 agree when we uh when we created crypto everyone applications on the internet we're good at making web 2 applications like developers have gotten mastered the web 2 universe the web 3 universe is a new universe and so it's not like we can just immediately be imbue all of these applications with everything all components of decentralization some things are easier to decentralize than others for example dydx was non-custodial from the very beginning but it's always had centralized servers in doing the orders and that like some things are easy to tackle some things are hard and we just need more innovation to tackle the rest of the things uh and so i i would just like to say that like it's it's we just have to wait for the decentralization of the of the base layer to work its way up the stack into the application totally and we're we've already seen it happen so do you remember a time where there was only centralized exchanges right there was there was no such thing as d5 if you wanted to exchange one crypto asset for another you had to go to coinbase and you had to use a centralized exchange and somebody could look at that and be critical or they could just wait a couple years and now we have tons of decentralized exchanges so we are working our way up the stack uh wholeheartedly believe but uh good post good reminder there's also a uh some down time for arbitrage that happened this week a few hours of downtime on the arbitram sequencer so why did arbitrum go down david and uh what did that mean i don't actually know the how or why it went down but this is what happens when you have a centralized sequencer you know single point of failure the sequencer is down therefore arbitrary is not producing blocks so assets are can't move on the arbitrary layer two they can be withdrawn from the layer two but they can can't really have like the super fast transactions or super low fees on arbor drum i think was down for uh four or five hours or so um and i actually haven't read the post mortem about it but i think there was some equipment failure or something and sort of their redundant equipment their redundant hardware it's like kicked the power chord yeah somebody kicked the power chord um yeah but so the the the thing about this is of course uh this is less severe in my mind than a layer one going down right because layer twos always have layer one to to fall back but i think it's an interesting question an escape hatch an interesting question is okay well so during that five hours of time during that outage window uh could people actually withdraw to the l1 like it's a good time to test this uh this this theory and what's interesting about that is like number one for roll-ups optimistic roll-ups is actually the withdrawal period takes seven days it doesn't happen immediately uh and the second thing is it's not easy to do that right now like it takes some command line technical skills digging into the code to actually execute withdrawal and so user interfaces easy user interfaces aren't available to do that but the fact that you can that this bridge exists also means user interfaces are getting spun up and going to be spun up to make withdrawals easier if this happens again so yeah it's it's different when l2 goes down versus an l1 but it can seem similar i think to people if they don't have an easy way to actually exercise and use that escape hatch and we're not there yet like we don't have easy user experiences to to be able to go back to layer one right we know that it is technically possible to do this so if you had your money on there you would be technically able to do that it would just be a matter of just like making the effort to like if you don't know how to code you got to go find a developer you need some instructions stuff like that but you know it's technically possible now the next step in the l2 ecosystem is making it easy i know teams like l2b are working on having front ends for every single significant rollup so you can just press a button there and this is a very solvable problem uh and just like like you said this is fast chains like optimistic roll-ups are unstable chains fast equals unstable we can do some optimizations we're going to make these things stable more stable over time but if you want fast you have to commit to some amount of instability that's just how it works and that's why fast chains belong on the layer twos because you don't want unstable l1 because imagine if ethereum was a fast chain and then ethereum halted or went down every single l2 would be stuck like you wouldn't be able to get your money off of and you're dead you're you're dead yeah you're dead god so it's over stability on the layer one speed on the layer two that's how it works let's talk about the nft game some cool stuff going on in nft world uh ap this associated press they just doubled down on nfts so they're launching a marketplace for some of their iconic images a ton of really fantastic images from the associated press over the years they are doing this these photography nfts on polygon as well really cool to see i guess literally mainstream media entering the nft market yeah um an nft a photo nft photography marketplace is do you feel like that's a nascent space like hasn't really been developed yet i hope so um yeah uh photography was my like side gig throughout high school and college so it holds a special place in my heart um one of the my frustrations with the industry was that like in order to pay bills i would have to take like photos photographs for events and that wasn't like my creative expression right and this is the power of web3 we can unleash creativity shout out to the podcast coming out on monday with lee jin and the creator economy and what crypto protocols can do to unleash everyone's internally native kernel that they have inside of them get paid for your creativity now really hard to do that these days but more opportunities coming with web3 this is this is cool as well why won't you talk about this so it seems like nas is doing something in the spade nft space yeah people will will remember our two episodes that we've done with blau the dj blau who has the royal platform uh ryan might call him three lao sorry royal is a tokenized music platform so if you like a song and you think that it is going to be a hit you can buy a song and receive royalties and now noss has joined royal or will be joining royal no it has joined royal on the 11th so two days ago and is selling royalty rights to two of his songs as nfts so music nft has really taken center stage lately the the vision with uh for blau or three lao as you like to call him david is like you know turn spotify into into a marketplace into an ownership economy so you find some hot artists that you really really like their music buy some royalty license and receive a piece of that in the future pretty awesome uh what that unlocks for creators and fans imagine you're like going out to like starbucks and like a song that you own comes on imagine how good that would feel that would be amazing i just made money yes you're making money right now amazing uh pudgy penguins let's talk about let's talk about some drama right so like nfcs are up nfts are down which is yeah some some are up some are down but uh penguins are down and they're they're down bad because some dramas going on i haven't been following this closely let's tell us well it's a little bit of a chicken in the egg as to which uh what came first did the prices go down and then drama happened or did drama happen and then prices went down perhaps a little bit of both it's always a flywheel there's some drama with the team because my kind of take here is that because the pudgy penguins never really caught on as much as the other nft projects uh the prices never really did the things that other nft projects so that's frustrated the founders and the the drama is that they are looking just to sell the project uh you can do that apparently i didn't know you could do that um i mean i guess somebody owns the admin keys for that uh and so they they wanted to list the project for a pretty large sum of ether something over a thousand ether no one took a bid they dropped that price down to 888 ether i'm not sure anyone took a bid on that either but they are looking just to exit the project because i think they are just kind of done with it except the thing is like it's the penguins community is strong like it's not like the community's absent there's just friction between the founding team and the community and so like what i'm kind of hopeful for ryan is that this kind of turns into like a sushi swap story where just the perhaps less aligned founders and i do not know the full story here i do not know there's the the founders there's takes and sides to unpack on both sides i'm just giving some preliminary takes my take here is that the founders are just not as committed they're ready to move on but the community wants new leadership and so this is kind of like the community taking over hope maybe taking over the project and finding a new leader to spearhead the pudgy penguins project into perhaps new successes perhaps this is a sushi swap moment uh where like you know it starts off good then fails and doesn't get the traction because you know some some malign founders and then the community takes over and takes it from there i don't know um disclaimer i guess i have like three penguins i think um maybe four you know my take is we don't have this kind of drama in the turtle community okay so i don't know what you penguins are doing but when's the last time that you've talked to a number a member of your turtle no drama all right in fact it's it's silent most of the time completely silent that's how drama-free it is turtles don't make noise they don't that's true uh let's talk about some some nfc projects that are going up yeah the w's this week doodles is one what's happening here yeah doodles i i i didn't get the doodles but other people do do doodles just caught on a ton of them look like yeah what does a dude look like here's doodle number they definitely look like doodles that's nine one four there there's okay that's a doodle kingdoodle that's a king oh god oh that's five million dollars for king doodle that's well that's the current offering but yeah that is like the best doodle out there click click the doodle link on the top center so we can look at some more doodles um my opinion on these is that they don't really differentiate themselves as much but people are really really liking them uh and so doodles really won the nft market uh lately yeah a number go up they're crushing it their floor price above 10 eth right now yeah at the start of the november it looks like the floor price was around 1.5 to 2 and now it's at 10. and that is only one of two winners uh in the nft market we gotta ask we gotta ask carly what's going on overpriced jpegs carly another bankless show it's just uh yeah it's all about nfts what's going on with the dudes what's going on with the doodles dudes this is cool this project uh world of women so www uh i always think of world of warcraft but they are crushing it as well this is another project on the ascent looks like they're getting a lot of celebrities purchasing these world of women uh nfts legendary music manager known as uh guy osera has just bought is how you pronounce his name or am i making an embarrassing celebrity thank you no this is the first time i've heard you don't know either okay we're both we're both members 15 million worth of nfts in the last week were sold of these wow uh nfts pretty cool what's going on eva longoria i think i saw last week purchased one what's uh what do you make of this yeah i think uh all the nft ladies or defy ladies that i know who are into nfts have their flex in their their world of women nft so a world of women nfc is very hot with the ladies so if you're trying to impress a lady friend perhaps get her a world of women nft and maybe that's that's why the price is going up i do think that some of these look really really cool um uh they're just had these gradients they have a very artistic uh ladies love the world of women nfts um i know cami russo has one i know aubrey strobel has one yeah i see it yeah right beyonce huh yeah he's got jay-z has a crypto punk right matching beyonce yeah he's gotta get one yeah crypto punk plus world of women collab relationship love it love it god oh that's going to happen too we just predicted it here all right uh let's let's keep moving nba top shots they are banning users right now this is on the flow blockchain nba top shots the application specifically this is um purported to be an nft platform as well seems kind of anti-crypto to start banning users particularly like for geopolitical reasons like bending over to authoritarian nation-state pressures uh am i reading too much into this or what's going on um that's that's the signal that i'm hearing because we know that the nba has bent the knee to chinese influence before so that there's very strong precedent before the nba and this is actually a global macro problem at large like every i mean i'm going to swear everyone's kind of the china's like they own all of our assets they own our stock markets uh they like uh they kind of control us uh they they control hollywood they control the narrative like if you say something bad about china you can't that you can't put that in hollywood uh that's a listen to the hidden forces podcast about this with dimitri if you want to unpack that a little bit more i think it's a systemic problem but it's outside the scope of the bankless podcast except when a blockchain like flow from which are from dapper labs has nba top shots on top of it that's banning a banning users and freezing assets because of a free hong kong username uh i don't think that has explicitly been stated as in that was why uh they they just said that uh the user provided false or misleading information during the verification process according to an email and they said that this activity breaches one or both of the top shot terms and use of the dapp lab service terms of use maybe it was something else uh i don't know but blockchains cannot freeze stuff and so this is why i have always had a grudge against flow and dapper labs because if you can freeze something you're not a blockchain you're a database you're not permissionless you're permissioned and so i tweeted out uh this morning and said hey dapper labs the the the guys behind flow the blockchain that nba top shot is built upon i said if you can ban a user on nba top shots for a free hong kong username and freeze their assets you don't deserve to call yourself a blockchain the name nft requires strong property rights your nfts are fraudulent get gtfo out of here i guess that's a little bit redundant your nfts are fraudulent your the tokens only work if they're actually tokens on a blockchain with strong property rights if you can take someone's nft from them it's not an nft stop using the word nft that's our word you don't get to use it yeah you get to use a jpeg like your nfts are fake our nfts are real get the hell out of here and stop with this decentralization theater because you're harming users by freezing their assets and taking away their accounts okay so some people are listening to that and they're gonna feel like you came down too strongly on this david so you know what do you think about that it's like do you think that's being a little too decentralization uh maxie about this blockchain do you think there's a role to play for nft platforms that are more centralized like flow what would you say to somebody who who you know says that i think dapper labs in china came on too hard on this particular user like i'm sorry like i will take i will take the blame that uh perhaps i have been too critical on other other blockchains uh which i am working on that's one of my resolutions in 2022 to not be kinder be kinder to some of the blockchains out there that have meaningful adoption uh things like avalanche things like solana gonna be kinder to them moving forward but david gets fired up when there's a freezing account when you can freeze an account like you gotta draw the line somewhere ryan and i draw the line at china using its nation state influence to control a blockchain and a user's funds like uh at some point but the decentralization maxi comes out like i'm sorry i do feel like that this is part of at least our role in the space or bankless role or like what i feel like i care about most uh i've noticed a lot uh in just kind of mainstream you know reddit and such just different subreddits people hating on the term metaverse because they're like what is metaverse it seems like this virtual reality world that facebook wants to control to suck out all of our energy and trap us into their ad platform and like we've been there done that we don't want part of mark zuckerberg's uh dystopia right and i'm like i i see that and i'm like my god now facebook gets to co-op the term metaverse right i'm like hell no the metaverse is about strong property rights not about virtual reality it's about strong property rights so i do get fired up and i do agree that there's things that we have to do in the space to like make sure that we have crisp definitions of things and in nft the term does imply some level of property rights it might not be ethereum the main chain level property rights but it has to fall somewhere in the in the in the spectrum of cannot be censored yes or else it is no longer an nft it becomes the thing we already had in the past which is just a jpeg selling for an exorbitant price and i'm not sure where exactly that line is but i agree david when you start to see censorship when you start to see banning when you start to see like some authoritarian pressure being put down on a platform and then it just like kind of crumbles away like that is where you have to start drawing the line and i do think that's partially our role in the space so what like let's definitely be nice you know compassionate but like i i think this is part of um what uh what we need to do as uh as people on the bankless journey is like appreciate respect uh decentralization and evangelize for it tell people why it matters so much absolutely yeah and to their credit avalanche solana i haven't i haven't heard of any of those blockchains freezing anybody but when they do look out dave we are talking about it we are talking about it in angry tones yes that'll be the angriest part of the podcast this is pretty cool okay on the regulatory front paypal is um planning a stablecoin maybe now this is leaked news so paypal didn't come out and say it but somebody was like digging into the code and found references to paypal that it would be backed by the us dollar but how big would that be if paypal issued and launched their own staplecoin i wonder what that would look like and how that would change the conversation about coins in the united states pretty bullish from my perspective yeah the thing is that i mean i guess the competition in isn't all that crazy there's really only usdc and i guess also paxos i'm not considering tether as part of the conversation because it's offshore uh sure i guess there could be more competition in the stablecoin space we'll see how paypal uses its influence to penetrate its own stablecoin into the default markets the the next few uh things we'll talk about are all kind of related to that so there was this uh this hearing uh in in the senate i believe with powell and some very senators who were talking about stable coins various things and powell made the comment when asked if stable coins and essential bank digital currency could both exist simultaneously at the same time he said yes a central bank digital currency and stable coins are compatible they can both exist together you don't you don't have to just have one or the other so making some room for stable coins and then there was this uh senator tom emmer he just introduced a bill that actually prohibits the fed from issuing a central bank digital currency directly to individuals and this bill would also support privately adopted stable coins and here is his rationale for doing so as other countries like china he says develop central bank digital currencies that fundamentally omit the benefits and protections of cash think he means privacy it is more important than ever to ensure the us digital currency policy protects financial privacy maintains the dollar dominance and cultivates in innovation central bank digital currencies that fail to adhere to these three basic principles could enable an entity like the federal reserve to mobilize itself into a retail bank start collecting personally identifiable information on users and tracking their transactions indefinitely he goes on to say requiring users to open an account at the fed to access a us cbdc would put the fed on an insidious path akin to china's digital authoritarianism and he says any central bank digital currency implemented by the fed must be open permissionless and private this means that any digital dollar must be accessible to all transact on a blockchain that is transparent to all and maintain the privacy elements of cash that is incredibly powerful hearing that coming from a senator with a bill to back that up i'm not sure how much steam this bill actually has the likelihood of passage but i love that we're starting to have this conversation this is the conversation we need to have like digital currencies could be very bad very authoritarian could usher in a dystopia if we're not careful and the way to do it right is with public blockchains issues issue a stablecoin on a rollup even a central bank digital currency on a rollup have the private sector develop this out and and collaborate uh as well like this is the way to export the dollar in the digital world use free open source technologies blockchain to do it the combination there are plenty of good things about a central bank digital currency there's a lot of financial inclusion that it can bring and there's also a lot of bad things as if you just listed the censorship and all that stuff the combination of a central bank digital currency on a roll up on top of a decentralized public blockchain is the best of both worlds where we the fed gets to have all the control that it wants to have on the roll-up but it can connect to the rest of an open open permissionless financial system and the fed and the united the interests of the united states get to be instilled by injecting its dollars into the the market so uh i'm interested yeah it's pretty cool that this is uh actually maybe happening actually being embedded in a bill and i think this is bullish so david i think part of the reason we're getting some of the support in congress is because we have politicians running crypto platforms now one of which was erica rose whom we had on the bankless podcast she is running on a pro bitcoin pro crypto uh platform running against brad sherman who is about the most anti-crypto member of congress that exists uh and we we talked to her we had a great podcast episode with her earlier in the week uh folks can go tune in listen to that um you know it was really interesting after the podcast we we went and actually looked at donor records for people she said because brad sherman's toner records apparently it's open and transparent i have not done this uh before but uh this is brad sherman's donation record what do you see in here david oh god number one clocking in at number one wells fargo and company uh clocking at number two goldman sachs space exploration technologies corp don't know what that is uh but we got some banks uh liberty mutual uh insurance company um a lot of big banks here big big banks big companies finance yeah uh-huh um yeah so you know we don't we don't have any bank support on bank list dewey ryan and you don't like them don't no you don't get donations from wells fargo unfortunately i don't think they're aware that we exist um quite a contrast though versus uh erica rhodes donor list look at this ryan cilcus clocking in that the first donor ever for erica rhodes ryan selkis the crypto native the crypto believer the crypto politician nice job brian a bunch of individuals here too which is really good to see and so you donated too david this is important to you yeah totally uh i mean one part because i want uh my money to go to erica roads but also i want to virtue signal and signal to the rest of the crypto world that they should also be donating to erica rhodes and i think this this story of erica rhodes versus brad sherman it's going to be a it's a great microcosm just of so many things that are that need to happen in my opinion as a millennial in america we have brad sherman who is like again no offense to the boomers but like they kind of have outsized representation and brad sherman doesn't spend a lot of time in his district uh and uh he's owned by the institution he's owned by the institutions and erica rose says that uh rhodes says that his disposition is that he thinks that that seat is just his that no one can really take it from him he's been an incumbent for over 20 years uh and so we have this incumbent boomer who uh doesn't who hates crypto who's backed by the banks and and going up against him is this millennial elementary school teacher who's in her district talking to her people and who thinks that bitcoin and crypto innovation needs to remain in america you know crypto and bitcoin they're not her number one priority but like in stark contrast to brad sherman who wants an outright ban on crypto all erica has to do is be like yo like yeah let's keep bitcoin innovation in america i have a good idea let's let's keep an open mind yeah that's literally all you have to do all you have to do just keep an open mind and let it happen and she's had she's had plenty of personal stories where people have been able to get out of uh she they're parts of her district that are live in poverty and are un uh that are unbanked and she has stories of her constituents using bitcoin to access financial services and like sometimes we forget about how much of the american population is actually unbanked so i donated to erica rhodes i hope that you consider i'm not telling youtube i hope you consider also donating to erica rhodes at the very least to get this brad sherman just what's the right word loser out of congress incumbent yeah do it for your bags do it for your bags because if we can get erica rhodes elected it'll it'll set off a domino effect of politicians be like oh god the crypto people put all their money behind erica rhodes and it worked like imagine the influence that that would cause if we could get this to happen so like the the roi from this from just a industry adoption perspective is so huge there you go guys uh we will be right back with the takes of the week and of course things we're excited about in the mean of the week so stay tuned for that we want to first tell you about these fantastic

week let's start with this one from vitalik buterin this was from the reddit ama with ethereum researchers that conducted last week but it was a really good take and vitalik tweeted it out it was his argument for why the future will be multi-chain rather than cross-chain there's some differences there and he says there are fundamental limits to the security of bridges that hop across multiple zones of sovereignty what did he mean it's cool because we discussed some of this on our bridges panel that we just had earlier in the week if you guys want to hear that discussion go check this out the great l2 migration panel where we dig into some big brain bridging projects and we get their insight on this take too but i thought this was a super interesting take and it reminded me of our episode that we did with rin christensen about the um the security hazards of relying on bridges that are multi-sig that are centralized bridges and how that is kind of the destination we're heading to towards if we go in the direction of a massive cross chain ecosystem where you have one layer one communicating with a second layer one vitalik goes and kind of illustrates the difference here it's really interesting if you have say ethereum and you want to get that to the solana token and you transport that ether to solana it becomes kind of a soul eth type token and it has a much different security profile than uh ethereum because why because you have to use some level of a trusted bridge in order to get that ether to solana and the other direction is true too if you take solana and you move it to ethereum you have a weaker form of solana uh and that that because there is a a security there because there is a bridge in between those things it really changes the risk profile of the asset so something could happen in that bridge and the ether that you had on solana becomes worthless or worth like 50 60 of the value that that it should be worth and so this becomes a problem when you get like chains of chains that are strung together and all connected by bridges because it creates a very fragile ecosystem for finance so that's why vitalik says he actually doesn't think that world is is very likely what he instead thinks is more likely is that we'll have very clear zones of sovereignty so you'll have sort of an ethereum world you'll have a solana world you'll have an avalanche world and their assets their version of an erc20 and their tokens will be kind of isolated into their universes so for ethereum and you know layer two that's all one in the same universe but as soon as the assets transfer to something like solana it enters into a different zone of sovereignty so it kind of for me david it sort of throws a monkey wrench in the gears of this idea of a multi-chain ecosystem i know there was some pushback on on this post from vitalik but what's your take on it people have identified blockchains as like the new age nation states for a really long time and this is just an articulation of that thesis where solana and its layer two ecosystem if it ever develops one it would be great to keep to for to for that ecosystem right like solana uh tokens get put on solana l2s ethereum tokens if the iron man ft is going to put on ethereum layer twos but when we talk about multi-sig bridges the whole point of these crypto things is to have strong settlement assurances that are trustless and as soon as you use a multi-sig bridge which is the only way to go from one l1 to another l1 uh you compromise on so much of what makes blockchain super super cool uh and so i think what vitalik's saying is that like he's not saying that there's going to be one chain to rule them all he just kind of thinks that like the solana things are going to stick inside of the solana ecosystem the avalanche things are going to stay inside the avalanche ecosystem and there's not going to be too much interconnectedness between these things because they say that it's like there there's going to be borders there's going to be borders these are borders yeah and it's going to be difficult to pass through these things and you're going to have less incentive to do so because imagine if like just like you're the example like imagine if you took uh wrapped ether you sent it over to avalanche to the avalanche bridge you sent that from from so now you have wrapped ether avalanche wrapped ether and then you take your avalanche wrapped ether and then you send it to selana and then you have solana avalanche wrapped to ether and then you send it back to ethereum and it would be solana ethereum avalanche wrapped ether it would be a complete mess where if you send it to a a roll-up you don't you don't stack the dependencies you don't stack the risks the risks stay small rather than compounding yeah so it's interesting i i do think we'll have multiple layer ones in the future but they'll all sort of be like nation states and that they'll have borders and they'll be trade between these nations right it doesn't mean the the you know the different chains the different nations will will be at war they will interact and will they they will have commerce but i i do think you will have like citizen assets and you will have foreign assets and uh when you project that forward um you know that that's an interesting way to uh to see how crypto is going to evolve and i don't think that's very widely known or appreciated that um you know the security profile of an asset can change drastically when you connect it with a multi-sig bridge we can even talk about the concept of like tariffs right because if you want to take like the solana token and wrap it on ethereum and then use that as collateral these applications are going to have to take into account that increased risk and they will be charging uh higher fees they should chris greece so yeah because they're taking that's your asset right and so like there's gonna be like pseudo tariffs in order to port your assets into a non-native uh domain it's funny maybe not as borderless as um as people hope yeah borders new borders well new nations new borders yeah that's right makes sense um let's talk about this this was a take from someone who said crypto people we need to make crypto accessible and also crypto people ethereum arbitram squat zika sink plonk vitalik buterin as if all of these terms are uh esoteric and hard to understand anthony sasana with with the take under this take um internet people we need to make the internet more accessible internet people tcpip html css json api modem i think what he's saying here is all of these terms will become so native to us that they won't really matter anymore right so like like the terms for the internet like the word jpeg at one point in time that was geek speak right right it's like or gif that was like that was nerdy talk right like you're oh you're an html programmer using gifs and jpegs like that's nerdy right that's geeky but now it's just a common it's common parlance it's entered mainstream and a lot of these things like tcpip that people haven't heard of well mainstream users don't actually have to know what the tcp ip protocol is to use a website or use an application i think anthony's saying that all of this will get wrapped into the internet just as the previous generations of the internet have been wrapped into it that's exactly right these are things are going to get abstracted away actually i don't even know i don't think i could name a single one of these things like i don't know what a tcp is i know ipa's internet protocol html i don't know what that is css i don't know what that json i don't know what these things are i don't know what they are i mean i know i know what they are but i don't know what they stand for uh and so like the point of technology is to abstract away the protocols and make these things super accessible and so the fact that the protocols exist are what makes them accessible is now it's up to the interface layer or the browser layer to obfuscate these things also and also kind of weird that this uh user listed vitalik that's an esoteric name metallic butter is not necessarily the most accessible person out there so i take a point he's just metallic though you don't have to use his last name you know he's kind of like madonna or prince it's you know it's just metallic um let's go here kobe had a fantastic clip should we play this uh yeah let's play it before i had money i thought everything was a scam and it was all rigged and blah blah blah and now having money and being able to help my family out for example and seeing um my parents personalities change because they don't have to worry about certain things anymore like making ends meet or like what's gonna happen when they retire seeing their personalities change and getting to know them more as people because some number changed on a screen makes me aved like everything seems like a giant scam but b feel like i was also slightly robbed of experiencing that while i was growing up or when i was younger because they had these burdens and had to worry about them so it doesn't weigh on me so much but i do think a lot about about that like it feels like everything is a bit of a scam for some like weird numbers on a screen and it means that people like live their lives in ways where they don't get to properly know the people around them because everyone's always worried about short-term stuff so david this clip was from our recent episode with kobe and absolutely blew up on twitter why do you think it resonated and landed so much with people well everyone kind of resonates with the story at one point another it's not like most people struggle with money um that's something that usually everyone comes across and so everyone kind of ideates about what their life could be like if money wasn't an issue and i think that was the biggest issue or the biggest takeaway that i had out of this is that like a lot when ryan and i you really you and i really emphasize decentralization and you know some people just aren't in a place that they can worry about decentralization they need to worry about other things like getting out of the rat race getting out of the nine to five actually having stability in in financial terms then they can start to worry about decentralization so that's kind of my takeaway yeah i really like this conversation with kobe because like i think he um he articulated things differently than bankless and pushed back on on some different things that i think we we emphasize from time to time like with some reflection uh yeah i sort of thought about this this is uh my tweet um people don't come to krypto for decentralization they come to get rich so they can live fuller freer lives and they don't like anyone gatekeeping about how they got rich pontificating decentralization is the thing people do after they get rich that's why it can feel out of touch i think you and i on bankless a lot like we talk about decentralization so much that um that can become in some people's minds sort of like the the end game like why are david and ryan always preaching about decentralization and i think we have to remember collectively all of us in cryptos like bankless and you know listeners externally decentralization is just a means to an end it is anti-corruption technology but the end goal is freedom and you know if you don't have if you still live in sort of the scarcity mindset of living paycheck to paycheck right and you know uh money is a real issue for you well like you don't have freedom either so at some level thinking about systemic problems like decentralization like that's something that you do after you have money so i think sometimes that is why when and this is for for people who value decentralization like us and talk about it so often that's why it can come across just sounding preachy or out of touch because like hey like people are in crypto and i think part of the attraction that brought you and i encrypted of course is like the ability to make money fast right towards some financial freedom in the future what are you going to do with that freedom like live a fuller life provide for those around you that's what kobe's clip was about too and i think we have to remember that uh as we're talking about and extolling the virtues of decentralization that it is a means to an end freedom is the end and um there's like you almost have to get you have to do well for yourself first to fully appreciate that and that gives you the the time to think about these these higher level things like decentralization um so some people aren't ready to talk about decentralization yet and um yeah i think sometimes we run the risk of like if we over emphasize it we um we might sound a little bit preachy or out of touch and um yeah i don't know what your thoughts are it's a it's a hard thing to talk about sometimes yeah yeah it's it's definitely a privilege to be able to care about decentralization like it's it's it's what i hope people all people after they get theirs lean into after they get theirs right right it's something that we all should strive for but i i now fully accept that anyone needs to do whatever they need to do to get out of the rat race and and to get theirs and and so i think the mistake that perhaps we've we've made is that ryan you and i have made our wealth using decentralized assets bitcoin and ether and if you go and everyone who comes into crypto uh is kind of a product of the generation that they came in at right like you came in i think in 2016 i came in 2017 and the only two assets that made it through the 2018 to 2020 bear market actually there's three of them uh bitcoin it's and which is decentralized ether which is decentralized and what what's number three ryan like that dogecoin also decentralized uh and so like that's a lesson that we've learned and we've we saw the centralized spin-offs come and go things like eos uh and like things like all the i can't remember all the other centralized spin-offs that came out in 2017. and so we saw centralization fail and we didn't want to see history repeat itself but it didn't um some some acceptable amount of centralization has worked out and it's made a lot of people very very uh wealthy uh and what i think the mistake we made was like it's like hey we we made our our wealth using decentralized assets you need to make your wealth with decentralized assets too and so we kind of gate kept how people choose to to choose to you know get out of the rat race and i think that that was a mistake that i am now reflecting upon however i i i want to also extrapolate into the future the reason why decentralization uh works so well and why we emphasize it is because decentralization means that there's room in the future for future generations to also make their wealth because in my mind centralization tilts into the favor of a few people rather than the many whereas decentralization is much more balanced and much more long-term focused and so i think the world will have more total wealth for more total generations and be able to include more people in the long term if we ultimately land on decentralized platforms so we have to have to consider the near term of needing to get wealth now so people can actually start to care about these things while also ensuring that we are decentralized enough to include future generations so that they can also get theirs yeah i think i think part of part of the bankless platform from from day one has been like kind of no shortcuts right and that's that's been important it's like i i i do think that um some of the centralized l1 will not stand the test of time and i'm not sure there's a lot there's too many those are and we've seen many cycles where you know that has happened they've just kind of you know collapsed and if founders have gone on to other projects they've never really developed a community and i worry that that is also happening this cycle too which is why it's like it's kind of like part of the call for bankless is like hey think about the long term right it's like what what has fundamentals what is sustainable uh you know decentralization is is one of those things that is sustainable in the long run run is a competitive remote competitive advantage but it's not the only way to do well in the crypto markets right and i think um one of the things that that we need to take with us in 2022 is just like being happy when people do well and achieve financial freedom in crypto and i think we've always been that and at times when we've been harsh it's been like i think more directed at i feel like people who should know better right it's like yeah justin tron should your justin's son rather should know better in like copy pacing ethereum hyping it up making a big deal you know like issuing tron and then exiting the project and then just a couple and then collecting more ether than vitalik buterin it's just like it's just it sucks okay it's like so people have been in the space for a while they've seen these cycles repeat and they just like they see it every time and that's why they come off a little like you and i sometimes come off a little a little strong a little harsh on other projects but uh anyway that's that was a good learning lesson from kobe and i think one of our takeaways so we'll carry that forward um david what are you excited about this week man oh man right after this ryan i'm taking all the stuff that you can't really see in the background because i'm hiding it putting it in my car and going off to joshua tree because i just got done ice climbing but i haven't finished getting my climbing fix so i'm on my way to joshua tree so you can go climbing so here's the ice climbing pitchers yeah that's awesome by the way like yes there's a harness with that rope definitely holding on to me but like i am also holding on as i take that selfie that's not just a relaxed arm holding on to an ice axe like how um how secure is that ice axe uh yeah it's holding it's holding my entire weight between that sex ice axe and my feet in the wall yeah that's my entire weight wow and you're totally roped in like yeah yeah you could possibly go in wrong right yeah i mean i did fall off the wall and got caught by the rope a number of times yeah but okay well so it's it's been tested there yes i thought you had a pretty funny funny comment in this which i i think is linked oh yeah yeah i said this yeah when someone says bankless is too risky adverse i'm tweeting them this photo these photos uh yeah absolutely man you're doing it something i could never do ice climbing yeah on the edge hopefully i'll maybe i'll come back with some pretty dope rock climbing pictures as well sweet ryan what are you excited about uh i'm excited about competition coming for for openc i think this is a big deal i think these kind of community-led vampire attacks really level the the playing field i mean we're talking earlier in the episode about um vc things getting attacked by community things i think that's a trend that's that's going to continue um and i think ultimately users win from that right so like we get new platforms we get new experiments we get to put the incumbents on their heels to you know think about who they're rewarding in their ecosystems and it's all net positive so i'm super excited about that i'm also excited about the recent unblocking that is happening in crypto twitter so right like encrypted twitter there's always backs and for back and forths um like people make enemies you know block people some people block you one person that's blocked me and i had no idea why is sam bankman freed from ftf's uh sbf and he um i don't know maybe something i said at some point in time we've never really had an interaction on twitter but um with kobe's with this this video that kind of went viral um you pomp actually tweeted this out yeah who doesn't talk about bank list doesn't tend to talk about bank lists right but by the way i had some nice things to say about anthony pompliano because i do respect what he does in the space and his hustle uh and his ability to to build fantastic uh media products media companies uh and you know so he tweeted something out from bankless which never happens about kobe uh and then a bitcoin maximalist who we've had on the podcast uh preston peace said wow i really like this point kobe says oh my god i got unblocked i guess preston pish had blocked kobe in the past so he got unblocked and i said we're healing the world out here kobe next someone get sbf
