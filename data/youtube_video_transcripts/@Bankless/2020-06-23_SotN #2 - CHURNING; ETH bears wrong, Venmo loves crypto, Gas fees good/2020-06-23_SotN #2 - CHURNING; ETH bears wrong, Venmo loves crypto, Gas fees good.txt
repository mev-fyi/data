welcome to a june 23rd edition our second episode of state of the nation we are glad you are with us so here's what we do in these episodes we talk about what's going on in crypto and we relate that stuff to the big picture to help you understand the state of the bankless nation so we release these episodes right here on youtube every tuesday make sure you subscribe and we also release them on the bankless podcast on wednesdays and here's the question i always start out with i'm going to relay this one to david david what is the state of the bankless nation today sir the state of the bankless nation is churning we are churning at the moment uh last week the state of the nation was bullish i said that uh defy tokens had really gone up a lot in price and that was uh illustrative of a catalyst of all of aetherium and then ether started pumping a little pump from 229 to 243 where we are today so i feel pretty validated about this one so i totally called it you just nailed it like because um i mean comp tokens did like after you after you said that after we gave the state of the nation they did like a a three to five x after that after you said it was bullish do you think state of the nation had any effect on the comp pump david hoffman oh one to one one to one it wouldn't it wouldn't have happened otherwise yeah that was my thought too okay so churning like so why are we churning okay so yeah so uh so we had that bullish week prices have gone up people are all talking about yield uh yield farming liquidity farming like bat is being borrowed and then relent yeah tether is just flooding into compound all of a sudden like all of d5 all the theories is like tether's cool now like it's we're okay with it all right it's got it's got it's real like it's here to stay so like our our mental models are now integrating tether our mental model yeah yeah it's it's yeah it's a real thing um and so like and so there's a lot of both both churn with like asset prices but also turn with mental models like the comp governance token and the saf g the simple agreement for future governance is like this brand new paradigm and that we're all trying to integrate into our brains there's a lot of change going on uh changes in the air so things are churning yeah yeah and i i guess one question for you so i last week i wrote an article um on and i published it monday and i said um stocks are drunk but defy is sober right and then we had that crazy week last week where it looks like it like defy might be drunk too is it drunk is this like going to cause problems for us later well i mean if we're comparing uh what 2017 was to being drunk and what we are uh today d5 is just a little buzzed it's been it's been sober for a very long time and it's just really sensitive right now because it hasn't had a drink in years okay so it had it had a small drink and now it's a little buzzed okay so it's all it's alcohol tolerance is low yeah due to abstinence and it's just a little buzz right now but um it feels good though we like the buzz we had a good week it was a good week now i think the big question on everyone's mind is what's going on with eth like the asset right so we see defy tokens pump like crazy i mean you competed maybe an 8x last week uh it's down a little bit from that ave too is up in the hundreds of percentage points uh synthetics as well from last week but eth is not following so ethan's been pretty flat honestly it's been it's been hovering around this uh price point of like 230 ish just recently had a small bump but we're talking mere percentage points um that was different like in 2017 in the ico wave that was a killer use case a killer app for ethereum it was decentralized funding of the protocol and the price of eth just went insane um like is that not going to happen in in this case is eth just going to kind of languish and fall by the wayside while d5 moons right so like all these defy tokens like comp like ave and now even mkr like the profits uh the cash flows generated by these systems are becoming less and less eth denominated right so like uh there's cash flows coming from tether which is definitely not ethan nominated as cash flows from die which is only limited ether nominated and we're seeing the backing of dye become less and less eath over time so like the bears are saying like eth is losing its like supremacy over over d5 tokens and the the value of comp the value of ave uh is and it is coming from other cash flows not just east denominated and so like that that is something to integrate into our brains like the eth uh isn't the one true uh asset of ethereum right like there are other assets that the evaluations of these d phi tokens uh gain their value from we have to remember that like ever since basically now very recently like all of maker dao was eth all of compound collateral was eth and it was just because there weren't other assets on ethereum right it was just a matter of just like what other assets are there on ethereum other than eth which was basically none uh but at the same time we've seen eth in compound absolutely skyrocket we've seen eth in d5 just defy just suck up eth and so it's also sucking up other assets too but also eth primarily is being sucked up by defy and so like there's going to be this constant tug of war for a while between the bulls and bears saying like d5 doesn't need eth and then the bulls are saying well yeah but like it's still using it like it doesn't need it but it's still using it like and so um uh i think that and it's all another thing to to point out is like defy isn't correlated to bitcoin btc but ether is and so ether's got this tug of war between like being correlated to bitcoin and being correlated to d5 defy has mooned bitcoin has not and so ether is like stuck in the middle yeah you know i should pull this up for um pull up this graph from d5 pulse for everyone who's watching um this is total value locked of denominated in usd in d5 and you can see the total value locked has absolutely skyrocketed given sort of the uh the d5 tokens adding rocket fuel to that 1 billion to 1.5 billion in what looks like two weeks that's insane and if you go by the way let me just show comp really quick um if you go to comp specifically this is the compound protocol that just launched the comp token that we talked about on the last day of the nation look at this chart wow right so yeah 100 million or so locked right in all assets all assets 100 million right all assets pretty flat to be honest and then then they issue comp tokens and they juice the returns basically um and we're up to 600 million now 600 million that's a 6x lead right in terms of the capital inside of this protocol and we talked to dan elizer about this uh in our episode that we released yesterday this is not free money that's being generated some people are saying like comp printer go bird right as if this is just um money coming out of thin air it's not really you're pulling it from future expectations of the compound protocol right and you're bringing those expectations into the present and in the future uh investors apparently if they're rational anyway they're expecting uh like comp to generate a return as a capital asset and that's why they're valuing it the way they are but soup it's juicing returns but here's back to back to eth if we look at um if we look at ethe locked in compound this is just denominated locked in compound look at that look at that pump that is too good yeah so so compound now has is just under a million it was a million each yesterday which makes us having two applications on ethereum that have what has one million each locked in it and there's there's like a 110 115 million each out there in in total and so like how many more of these do we need before like a a an a meaningful amount of eth is locked up that you can't argue with yeah totally i mean it goes to what you're saying is uh i don't think the bears like the bears are right that there are now other money assets on ethereum that are competing with eth um but what they don't understand is that the success of d5 like what's good for d5 is also good for eth and you're seeing it right in the charts because that's increasing the total amount of eth locked up um but like here's the question why hasn't this borne out why hasn't this flown into eve price yet right so the bears would say um you know that's because you're wrong guys that's because these two things are not related um i think the bulls would say just be patient it's been seven days right like these are market cycles we've come off of a two-year um ethereum winter where eth lost 95 of its value this is what amazon lost in 2001 when the dot-com bubble burst right 95 of its value in this winter and investors are skittish people are afraid people still are using like they're looking backwards at a world where it was just bitcoin maximalism and that was the only money and they're not looking at eth as a monetary asset um is that the reason why are we just in a cycle david what do you think yeah so so markets have memory inside of them right and so like and the d5 market has much less of a memory than the eth market does and the eath market has like fear and skepticalness baked into it because we went from 1400 down to 80 and now we're at two whatever yeah and and at the same time uh we we have gone up a little bit eth did run up a little bit 229 to 243 still not much could have been noise could have been uncorrelated however it did lead first bitcoin it started moving first sooner than bitcoin did and it was going up and then bitcoin dumped and it pulled down eth wit with it so like eth moved first and it brought b and then bitcoin also moved upwards after eth started moving upwards and then bitcoin dumped a little bit and it killed the momentum of eth and so like i really think that you know d5 is pumping and it's trying to bring eth with it but bitcoin is holding ether back because ether and bitcoin are so strongly correlated it seems that way you know the other thing i'm seeing is a um a narrative shift can you see my screen right here david yeah uh-huh all right so this was an excerpt i'm not gonna share the full email an expert an excerpt of an email i received yesterday from a fund manager a guy i know runs a decently small mid-sized crypto hedge fund uh he's got some other content in this but the the money line was this my fund was 60 bitcoin until recently now we're 80 eth and defy the time has come in my opinion is what he said uh above that he said basically um you know the last the previous cycle he's been uh allocated bitcoin uh but nothing's happening in bitcoin right now all of the action all of the activity is happening in the d5 ethereum space and bitcoin maximalists are going to get left behind and maybe they'll be a bit salty as a result of of getting left behind i don't know for sure if he's right but i do know um that i've seen a lot of places where sentiment see has seemingly shifted uh even you know one of our one of our friends hopefully he's coming on the podcast right chris uh chris berninski tweeted this he said if you think d5 will have a smaller impact on ethan icos you aren't paying attention defy will flex ethereum's ability to perform all in bold all financial services this is early stage capital formation is what he said uh are you starting to see the early signs of a narrative shift the thawing of the ethereum winter and people are like coming back to eth as an asset do you think we're getting closer to that yeah a hundred percent and it's just because it's coming in so many different directions right like you have your money your uh money verbs uh icon and like we are just not ethereum is just knocking them down one by one like got that one got that one got that one and also i think the biggest narrative shift is the seemingly one-way movement of bitcoin onto ethereum right it because it just goes to show that like people that own bitcoin bitcoiners or not want to do things that do verbs with their money and you just can't do that on bitcoin at least not in a custodial fashion okay so take that though so some people say bitcoin on ethereum is actually tokenized bitcoin is actually bull bullish bitcoin because they want to use the better money which is bitcoin even on the ethereum network and so bitcoin tokenized bitcoin on ethereum will uh cannibalize the moneyness of eth as an asset what say you well it is bullish bitcoin but it's not bullish necessarily bitcoin versus ether right it's it's good value for bitcoin i'm i'm really happy that bitcoin can do some of these things that it can do like you can generate a loan a permissionless loan inside a maker dial with your bitcoin and then ether is its own thing right and so like sure there's gonna be some like displacement of sorts in the same way that like tether is also displacing eth and and other assets will ultimately displace eth but this isn't a zero-sum game right like ether is going to go up especially because all economic activity ends up feeding into eth but just being proximate to each other is always going to be good and so like we can talk about how like bitcoin may be cannibalizing eth but it's only going to do it to a small degree and it's really going to just push the fold as to why ether and ethereum are important yeah it's it's hard to replace eth as trustless economic bandwidth i know we've both talked about this and written it about it we will include some articles and references to you if you want to understand the concept of trustless economic bandwidth we'll include that in the show notes you know one last thing we should we should maybe touch on before we leave this topic of why eve might be getting left behind but why i think both of us are still bullish eth and that's this nexo finance so this is a crypto bank um just last week the people linked some of their ethereum transactions uh to putting in usdt so they're putting assets in the compound protocol so this is a crypto bank depositing close to 30 million dollars or a few transactions here into the d5 protocol comp you know what this is this is the great protocol sync thesis that we've been talking about right i mean it is i mean we talked about in that episode we did on the critical synthesis we said look for signs of it this is it this is what it looks like you're seeing a crypto bank actively depositing funds they're like is it customer funds i'm not sure where these funds are but okay so they're depositing funds into the compound protocol right so they wouldn't do that they wouldn't deposit funds into a protocol that coinbase is spinning up or one of their competitors like crypto.com but they are inside this credibly neutral lending and borrowing protocol that's how the defy protocols slip underneath the crypto banks and there's the potential here david that crypto banks and other capital pools like them might actually be the primary consumers of d5 protocols if we're right if the protocol sync plays out the way we think it's going to and there's two things i want to bring up with this one nexo finance this gives nexo finance an edge because it's getting a return that other crypto banks aren't right yes and so that's good for nexo it's also making compound a better protocol at the same time because the more capital and liquidity inside of compound the better right so this is mutually beneficial for both nexo and compound and it's going to start to force the hands of every other crypto bank because their nexo has this edge that they also have available to them so they need to start using it and so like all these crypto banks are going to start you know and we've seen such a strong level of competition with crypto banks like you need to iterate and improve faster really really fast yeah so i think this is going to come really really quickly and the thing is it all converges upon the same protocols compound maker dow ave like you know dydx perhaps is even one uh and so like all these many many cryptobanks are going to converge upon the same d5 protocols and all those same d5 protocols their primary collateral is eth and my article um if ethereum is an emergent structure i had this section where i claimed like ethereum is the epicenter ether is the epicenter of ethereum it's the capital of the ethereum state right yeah so any application that uses some sort of crypto bank it lands upon ether ultimately like all roads lead to ether yeah totally i totally agree and it's exciting to watch the protocol sync play out a little bit we'll include some information about the protocol sync thesis in the show notes there's an at least a bankless episode you gotta write an article david like one of us does i wrote this little snippet of an article but we need something meaty because yeah i think the critical sync thesis is really what's going to drive the success of d5 and has already driven the success of bitcoin and ethan's assets so the people need an article my friend yeah no you're totally right i need to pound that one out now that we have already been talking about it so much we've already done a podcast episode on it it should be pretty easy yeah it should be i'll bang it all right before we go any further we want to talk about the sponsors that make this show possible uh the first is ramp i'm really excited about ramp because they are a crypto fiat gateway so the problem with a lot of uh defy applications is that most users you know 99 of new users are not going to have ether or crypto in their account so they can't even complete an ethereum transaction ramp solves that in like five minutes they can get crypto to a wallet so the key thing here is if you're a defy app developer you want to check out how to integrate ramp uh inside of your defy app and you're just going to like explode growth that's how we address the total the total addressable market for d5s we make fiat on ramps super easy we'll include info on ramp in the show notes part of the protocol sync thesis is that all these worldwide companies and businesses are going to ultimately use applications on ethereum and one way that this is playing out is through monolith monolith uses the visa network to generate a payment network but instead of using dollars in your bank account it uses die in a smart contract wallet so using that dense protocol die and maker dow and a smart contract wallet on ethereum you can top up your wallet with dye and then go to your local coffee shop your local whatever your local grocery store swipe your visa card and make each transaction that settles on ethereum using die so this is a great tool to live a bankless life uh to break up with your bank and still be able to access a normal life that is relatively indistinguishable from people that are perhaps not as far along in the bankless nation as you are are you're saying you we should break up with our banks but not be weirdos right break up with your banks but still be a normal person yeah don't you don't necessarily have to be a complete revolutionary yeah so you can check them out at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card today yeah definitely we are very practical on the bankless revolution i you know but breaking up with your bank is is a process it's it's less like a clean breakup and more like growing apart is is how i think about it um you start using your bank account less and less and networks like ethereum become more and more valuable uh for you that's the journey we're on it's been true in i think our daily living so we expect it to be true in the in the future but speaking of bull markets uh you said churning right um paypal and venmo an article came out this week that paypal and venmo are getting ready to add a buy crypto feature and i got to think they're certainly going to enable buying bitcoin right because where did that but ether can't be far far behind because it is also the only crypto asset that is cftc deemed they're an important regulatory body in the u.s they're they've deemed them a commodity no other asset has that distinction what do you think this is going to do once this is added are we going to are we going to see like more people on board it are your neighbors and friends and family and start asking you about like how they buy uh ripple i hope not god if they if they list ripple i will throw a fit um so this is just part of the the normalization of of crypto right uh bitcoiners would call this hyper bitcoinization and if they if paypal only added bitcoin that would probably fit well into that narrative uh however uh the reason why cash app only has bitcoin is because cash is run by jack dorsey and jack dorsey is very idealistic and and uh holds bitcoin in a more supreme position than other assets paypal doesn't have such biases or leanings right they're they are primarily focused on generating revenue and so they're probably going to want to they're going to one-up square right yeah more than bitcoin yeah they're going to have to force square's hands too so you're totally right it's probably going to be bitcoin and ether and then i bet a stable coin probably usdc it would be fantastic if they uh did die but diet doesn't have the same volume as usdc so i bet those are the three assets that are coming and like i bet right out the gate this doesn't really do much um it it just but again it forces the normalization of crypto and this is part of the settlement uh the protocol sync thesis right like all companies like legacy or not will ultimately use crypto because crypto in itself regardless of the apps on crypto crypto is a dense protocol and so they're going to it's going to find its way into uh banks like paypal or banks like you know wells fargo or whatever and so this is that playing out and paypal every every single person not every single person but like a lot of people have a paypal account especially millennials right especially young people and it's also in venmo like it's also going to be an app on your phone that you already have kyc with you've already submitted your id be wary of that by the way uh and it's already going to be a tool that you have to instantly buy crypto and send it into the ethereum economy yeah i think this is really important i mean so um this is how millennials and and certainly gen z pays for things right like we you know we're even like beyond pay pal it's just venomo uh you know if you're buying selling anything from anybody who's under the age of like 35 it's gonna be on on venmo and providing a gateway an in-app gateway to purchase crypto is really important i think for this generation to get into it i um i saw this tweet earlier this week about millennials having basically no money right uh into in terms of wealth as compared to previous generations so if you compare boomers to millennials boomers at the age of 29 or 39 and now like you have to remember the oldest millennial now is 39 which is like crazy to me but uh boomers had 21 share of the wealth when they were 39 when the first boomer hit 39. millennials have three percent of the total u.s wealth now that they're at the age 39. so this generation the millennial generation is not doing better from a wealth perspective than our parents were and to me i think we make the mistake a little bit as like millennials in looking for the nation state to solve all of these things because the nation-state is not necessarily equipped to solve these things the nation state is in a process of being squeezed that's what the last 30 years at least in the us have been it's been a squeezing process and right now with all the money printing you're seeing it's a squeezing process of the us dollar as reserve currency status something that the us essentially has worked for over generations um it's being squeezed out right now i think the big opportunities for millennials are actually going to be in these digital nation states as we call them like ethereum and bitcoin so having a gateway to those digital nations in apps that are easy to use and that we already use is pretty important at least to me and i do think these younger generations will be all about that and i hope they are and we've already seen the demand for this sort of activity from millennials right from the robin hood rally right people are taking their 1200 dollar like covid check their trump bucks throwing it right into robin hood and buying hertz as it goes bankrupt because they they know that these this sort of like gdp growth that came from to the boomers is not coming to them right i think uh in a similar stat like gdp growth uh during the boomers when they were from like 20 to 35 was like 34 and millennials it's been 11 and so we have seen one third of the growth in gdp in our best years in our best professional years uh than boomers have right and so what's what's that's doing is like millennials are like like well you know it like if i'm not gonna get a i'm not gonna get a high paying job and so because robots are gonna automate my job away so i'm throwing all my money into robin hood because this is like this gambling app so at least i have some chance of like generating some sort of wealth for myself and like and so that speak and that's because there's risk there and there's also risk and defy there's also risk in crypto there's also risk in ethereum and so i think this is just and but this is like real risk not just fake hertz is going to the moon because they're going bankrupt risk like this is real like value like measuring there's no there's no fed backing up crypto right no bailouts coming for us right nope wow so like millennials have this risk appetite right because they need they are looking for greener pastures and in my mind there is no greener pasture than than crypto especially d5 especially decentralized finance well because ethereum you said it before ethereum is an entire economy right it really is it's like going out west and settling right and people on the east coast who were comfortable in their positions and secure and fine with the status quo those weren't the ones traveling west in search of gold and opportunity it was it was the people who are looking for another chance looking for an opportunity outside of the existing constructs of the system uh and that's really where i do think the opportunity is there it's not gdp growth in the u.s it's gdp growth in the ethereum economy right also to add on to that to that metaphor like people went west to escape the tyranny of the state like they wanted to be free that was also a real thing yeah so that is a direct one for one comparison yeah that's why i love that analogy um david before we go any further we should talk again about uh our sponsors so i'm i'm super excited about multis so they've decided to sponsor bankless on the show and they are really providing a bankless business account so uh they've released a new edition of their application this is like a bank user interface but underneath it's all ethereum and d5 protocols um and we're going to be releasing a video on the channel about that too um and uh i plan to convert some of my business activity to malta's and and give it a try and you should too it is like a bankless bank account where you can operate your entire business on defy on ethereum super powerful stuff we'll include more info in the show notes for you to check out another great application on ethereum which we talk a lot about is ave ave is a borrowing and lending application you can supply assets you can borrow assets you can get an interest rate or you can pay an interest rate but what's different about ave is that ave will give you stable interest rate payments a really important tool to build out this defy economy this economy on ethereum if you are pulling out a loan you need to have some assurances that the interest rate on that loan isn't going to jump up to like 20 or something crazy which we have seen before in d5 so you can get that sort of stability and long-term thinking using ave they also have a tokens which are representations of the assets deposited in their protocol which has the interest baked into the tokens so you can use those to transact while also receiving interest rates interest payments at the same time check them out they're a fantastic protocol check them out at ave dot com david one more thing we should we should talk about and we we we're trying to keep the show a little bit uh we tend to go on for a while so we've got one more topic we're excited we're excited about this stuff guys you got to forgive us we're going to try to keep this to 30 ish minutes but i think we might be close to that now anyway um let's talk about gas all right so gas prices are too damn high you you agree or disagree like here's the gas price right now i'm sharing it this is eth gas station fantastic site so again uh eth uh gas is required for every ethereum transaction and gas prices go up and down right now they're fairly expensive i remember time not long ago when it cost two way to send a transaction now it's 46. it's been like 46 to 70 for a while is this a good thing or a bad thing for ethereum so i i think actually the the very the very correct answer is it is a thing so it is both good you're dodging a question it is both good and bad and to what degree it is good also generates some equal and opposite amount of badness and so here's what i mean by this the high gas prices on ethereum represent are correlated to the potential returns that you can get on ethereum right if there are high returns on ethereum there's going to be high economic activity and there's going to be high demand for block space also fees are good for the long-term health of the network in this new digital nation world feeds represent taxes and they are and the taxes are the thing that fund the economy right they they prevent they secure the ethereum economy so when we see high gas fees we can we can safely rest assured that like ethereum the ethereum economy is going to exist along a long time into the future because that's where revenue for security comes from at the same time it's bad right because you know high fees price people out and this is the main concern that like the ethereum side of things has versus the bitcoin side of things right if we have an inflexible block space and and extremely flexible block space demand what you get is really high fees and it ultimately forces the small guy out and only allows the large capital holders in who can afford those fees so that's bad we don't want that and that's why ethereum has always committed to scale uh and so like there's there's it's pros and cons there's pros and cons it's good and bad as you say it does seem to be the case look there's always going to be limits to the amount of block space available it's a scarce commodity right and it does we talked about this with nick carter it does seem like high density economic transactions by that i mean like the big ones the high value ones are going to be the ones that are prioritized because those transactions are the only ones that will essentially be able to afford these kinds of fees and the lower value transactions will move to layer twos to side chains maybe even to crypto banks so even though ethereum is scaling there's still a limit to the amount of transaction space in the ethereum network and there always will be right absolutely yeah but i would say like if you force me into a corner and made me answer this question i would say it's a good thing because the alternative is having like one way fees or two grey fees and that makes us look like a ghost chain and so like at the end of the day we do have to do this deal with the devil and ask for high fees because that means our chain is useful that means our chain is in demand and i would just refer that to low fees there's a lot of ghost chains out there a lot of ghost cities in fact almost all of them are go look at the transaction fees we'll put this in the show notes go look at the transaction fees of dash or ethereum classic or bitcoin cash or xrp it's nothing like like if you're looking at this chart this is okay so this chart is bitcoin in red and ether in purple right these are their the daily transaction fee revenue okay so let me just click in xrp let's see xrp way down here and this is a log scale graph right so 95 yeah 95 bucks a day baby 95 smackers for the whole xrp network that's how much they're making in transaction fees i don't even know who's paying that but it seems overpriced but um ether now is five 540k per day and over the past two weeks fourteen days it's actually been higher than bitcoin so bitcoin right now is three thousand two okay this is the highest it's ever been over bitcoin for this long amount of time oh the last time it was was in 2018 the last 14 day window but if it goes another week it probably will be the longest time transaction fees on ether like so what that means is block space on ethereum is more valuable currently than block space on bitcoin right like that's what that means it doesn't mean the asset is more valuable right bitcoin is bitcoin the asset is worth more than ether the asset but it does mean the ethereum block space is worth more right which is let's do some interesting let's do some eat killers will you click in ada and uh bnb are you just trying to embarrass these guys dude a little bit like they're never going to sponsor us now oh no oh wow oh look uh cardano is uh beating litecoin hey cardano flip into litecoin all right let's do bnb right below ada wait what is bo binance finance well this is uh this is uh you know the whole binance casino it's got that going forward oh they have they have over a thousand yeah finance has over a thousand dollars in in daily transaction fees right on the board on the board yeah i mean we could like litecoin oh don't do it like coins i mean no one no one cares about like no one's willing to pay for block and look there was a time look at this there was a time when no one cared about ethereum either right let's be honest look uh back 2016 no one cared no one cared and then they started to care because defy got its first use case january 2017 and then they really started to care right and now if the hearing block space has been consistently valuable up until about that time and it's been seeing a resurgence in its value so it's interesting to watch we don't have time to talk about all of the implications there's a whole discussion we could have david about like um fixed issuance in your monetary policy how that is supplemented by transaction fees and how bitcoin is essentially moving to a network that is all transaction fee uh you know revenue driven from a security perspective but we won't today because i think we're getting up to time yeah um i would like to plug uh anthony cesano's recent newsletter the daily gray where he broke down what the miners are doing about these high fees they're increasing the block size limit and so if you guys want we we can't go go into it because it's a really uh nuanced conversation with lots of things to talk about and anthony does a great job of breaking it down there so i would definitely recommend that a read if you are interested in this subject oh anthony i subscribe it's good he does it every day um yeah so so check this out daily great we'll put that as an action item other action items actually so as long as you're looking at things subscribing new things we release the bankless guide uh on saturday the bankless guide is basically the best of the best that we have published so far
