I've been in crypto for 10 years I think ethereum is the right balance between decentralization and pragmatism and I think building things that people can use are an underrated thing in crypto I think a lot of people tend to focus on the ideology which is important but what I showed up to work at coinbase and now what I'm doing with forecasters I want to build a protocol that has a billion plus people using it but I want to do it in a way that doesn't compromise on on the decentralization and the sovereignty at the user account level maybe it's a Fool's iron but that's what we're trying to do welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless do we really need decentralized social media Our Guest today Dan Romero says yes and he explains why we talk about the rise of decentralized social networks a few takeaways for you in today's episode number one why Dan thinks social media isn't broken uses a different term and we discuss what he means by that and why and number two we talk about what's new with decentralized social media why should people actually care about this not the hardcore crypto people who love decentralization but the normal people the masses number three we talk about how decentralized a social media Network actually has to be in order to work what should be on chain and what doesn't need to be on chain number four we talk about why a protocol not a company is really the way forward and finally we conclude the conversation about how all of this will fundamentally change the internet and the trajectory of humanity David what should listeners pay attention to this episode Dan Romero is of course building farcaster but I think he also really just lays out the blueprint for any decentralized social media Network any protocol and so while this is under the context of far Caster I think whatever decentralized social network does emerge out of the web 3 space it's largely going to be synonymous with the blueprint the map that Dan has laid out in this episode and so I think this this episode I think is actually going to be relatively Timeless even if forecaster for some reason doesn't see success some other social media decentralized protocol will eventually and it will largely follow the same blueprint that Dan lays out in this episode so I think that's really the thing to pay attention to is as you are listening to this understand what Primitives will be true no matter what flavor of social media protocol comes out of this base because I think if you're bullish on the space you are certainly bullish that eventually one will come out but maybe it's forecaster maybe it's a few others maybe it's others we haven't heard about but they're largely going to follow some of the same Primitives and same first principles that were communicated on this episode in the debrief David and I are going to discuss uh what we think about our experience with a current decentralized social networks as well so stay tuned if you're a premium member you can click right into that debrief before we get to the episode we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible including our friends at Kraken which is

you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21. month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop hey bankless Nation if you're listening to this it's because

journey West I'll see you in the Discord Bagless Nation talking about decentralized social networks today with Dan Romero he is the co-founder of farcaster which is a new decentralized Social Network that's captured the attention of many in web3 there are a few platforms competing for our attention these days and forecaster is certainly one of them we're going to talk all about that today and Dan it's great to have you welcome to bankless thanks for having me okay um let's start here with the big question uh what is broken about web 2 why do we need web 3 social networks why can't we just be satisfied with the web 2 versions of these things and how to even improve on those versions in a crypto version of a social network well maybe I'll start with a contrarian answer is I don't necessarily think web 2 is is broken I think it can be improved upon and so if you kind of just take the history of the internet web one you have decentralized protocols hdp SMTP DNS and if you wanted to put information online you basically went registered a domain figured out a web host put up a website and then hope people would find you Google made it a little bit easier um and then you kind of had with web 2 this explosion of user generated content and with that user generated content you got to a place where distribution became a lot easier right you could start a podcast put it on the iTunes store and then eventually on on YouTube I use Twitter for that distribution have a sub stack and so you kind of have all these great publishing tools where you can reach a massive audience and right like the whole Creator economy is a result of of web 2 getting these platforms to scale and then allowing people who might be a little less tech savvy but really want to go be entrepreneurial and build an audience like yourselves to to get to a really large scale but as that skill happened um you know we went from kind of this the classic Nag on Twitter in the early days was you know it's just a bunch of people saying what they ate for breakfast and then kind of call it around I don't know 2017 2018 it was a threat to democracy and so it's kind of a pretty big uh jump in a 10-year period to go from kind of a bunch of nerds talking about what they had for breakfast to you know this this is going to foundationally change the way our society is run and I think with that kind of growing importance in society and just by function of having billions of people using all these web 2 Services every day uh we're starting to see some of the limitations of of kind of having a single platform be for example the Public Square on the internet if you want to describe Twitter like that and it makes it really difficult when you when you have a global audience and a global user base to have a group of people in San Francisco whether it's a the public version of Twitter or Twitter owned by Elon Musk making decisions that impact how how discourse speech communication happens globally and I think where we sit now is I think people from across the political Spectrum I I think for the last few years it was almost kind of like hardcore crypto people were interested into centralization and then there was this kind of branding that the only people interested in in new social networks were kind of like right-wing people who had been de-platformed from a Twitter but I think quickly we've seen with with Elon taking over there's a a whole new group of people who are all of a sudden being like hey I should be able to post a link to a mastodon uh post and not have it be censored and and and so I think people are reevaluating some of the stuff from first principles and realizing hey there are other protocols out there on the internet today that we use that are uh decentralized permissionless the web and email being you know two really important ones I mean substance is a great example of a web 2 company built on top of a decentralized protocol email and so I think what we're hoping to do with forecaster is marry the kind of decentralized and permissionless Protocols of web one with the usability convenience ease of use that web2 has ushered in that billions of people around the world are now able to you know create user generated content online and kind of participate and so I think if you can marry the two of those things together then then you have a superior system so I think what you're saying is the distinction that you're making when I use the term broken to to maybe characterize web to you're sort of toning that down you're saying well not broken in that we need to do a wholesale you know rip and replace um but there are fundamental areas of of improvement so not broken but improve movement and I think maybe this is kind of semantics between the idea of something broken the idea of something needing to be improved but I think what you're saying is uh don't throw out the baby with with the bath water here there are some fundamental things that web2 did correctly uh namely getting the use case right and what we actually need to do is um figure out a way to improve on all of the flaws if we were to look at some of the flaws with uh web 2 right now I think we you sort of hinted at a few of them this notion of web 2 going to a place where Twitter going to a place where you know it was basically doing nothing to it was destabilizing our democracy uh wow that happened very quickly right and so that's one thing that people point to another thing is Bots are everywhere there's no concept of no notion of good Identity or human based identity another of us of course is you kind of alluded to this is um it's very controlled that means it's very sensorable um I don't have the ability to kind of own my own Twitter profile and my social graph it's basically the property of of Twitter and I feel somewhat like a uh you know a peasant on someone else's feudal land so maybe these are the things uh are is that list what you would point to as the Improvement areas and I guess my question is how does web3 help any of that and does it actually help any of that yeah so I think all those points that you made are accurate and things that web3 can improve on but the way I describe forecaster is there are two foundational principles that we are trying to achieve and they solve two different problems so the first is more for someone who who has an audience right you have an audience with this podcast you rely on web 2 platforms which give you again massive distribution ability to get your word out but you don't own your audience on I'd say most of those platforms sub stack being a rare example where if you're using um you know platform like YouTube you could have built up 10 million followers over you know five years and on an arbitrary whim no matter what what the reason they can turn your account off and you have no ability to get like kind of like one last export of those subscribers they have by the way Dan I don't know if you wear this but um on Mother's Day of last year YouTube shut down bankless uh and uh I thought you were going to say that they let you export the subscribers that's a pretty pioneering thing nope they they shut us down the worst one yeah okay and and so what do we do we go into cup no no word no word of warning just an email uh friendly email from some bot somewhere that says uh your account shut down and there's no kind of escalation process and the only thing we could do Dan at that time was to get real loud on other social media platforms and say look what Twitter look what YouTube did to us uh and which was only a luxury that we really had because other accounts were shut down that same day that didn't have the same sort of like feed uh following that we were able to uh invigorate to get the attention of YouTube yeah so uh apologize for interrupting you but this is this happens it happens uh in crypto it happens in other communities uh as well so uh go on well yeah I guess I don't need to sell you on this but but the idea that you could have built up this audience generate a lot of revenue for for whatever platform and with the snap of a finger it's gone there is no arbitration there is no get in front of a judge and make your case instead you get a an automated support email treating you no different than one of the kind of like CZ spambots on on Twitter I I think that is unacceptable in in a world where creators are real real businesses and this is your livelihood and so contrast that to email where if if for whatever reason you decided to not work with substack or substack didn't want to work with you it would be ludicrous if they they held your emails hostage right and and part of that is just a Norms thing right email pre-existed a lot of these webto platforms the idea that if you have an email newsletter you own your newsletter subscriber list is just kind of that that's what the Market Force is whereas I think with with these web 2 platforms because they've been so attractive from providing distribution and scale they've been able to get away with not allowing a kind of publisher or or Creator to own Their audience directly and so I think the foundational to to forecaster is you own your relationship with your audience and actually it's not even quite that because it's your audience owns the relationship with you right so someone follows you on forecaster it's not like somehow you you now can kind of ping them they've actually opted into following you but the important thing is no no third party can come in and say sorry these two adults cannot decide to to connect with each other over the Internet so so that's on the the Creator publisher side I think that the second thing that's really important and maybe I'm dating myself here but I remember when Twitter was a very open API and had a flourishing ecosystem of apps and a lot of people don't even know a lot of the core features of Twitter were invented a by Twitter users and B first adopted in third-party clients so at replies hashtags quote tweets retweets those were all conventions within the 140 character tweet box and then you had clients like tweetbot twitterific Tweety inventing okay this is how you natively handle it yeah and and for the first few years Twitter didn't even have a mobile client they actually acquired the the app called Tweety which invented pull the refresh so all the apps that you pull the refresh today you actually use a patent that Twitter owns and has decided to not generously not prosecute against but anytime you just pull the refresh in an app that was invented by a third-party developer on Twitter's API and then roughly around 2014 they basically shut that down they needed to make money on advertising and it's very difficult to do that in a in a kind of third-party app ecosystem and actually more timely as of I think like last week they did just turned off third-party apps right they kind of existed in this like weekend State for the last 10 years but but now like I don't think tweetbot works like they just shut it off overnight and again no communication these are people building businesses even in this kind of like weird world where Twitter never really liked their API and and another prominent example from you know the previous era was Facebook had an open platform pre-pre-mobile it was kind of like out all these games and all these things that are built on top of it Jenga was a company that basically built this entire business on Facebook and then in a very short period of time they kind of said hey this is de-prioritized tough luck like you know go find go find a new way to to build out these games and so that that those two examples from that era changed I think a lot of developers opinions on I'm not going to go build a business or make a serious investment in a platform knowing that you can have the rug pulled out from one of them and so I think with forecaster very much inspired by ethereum and in my time in crypto it's you need to build a platform that hits a bar that is truly instruments both on the access to the data and the apis to the system working so that as a developer if if you want to go build a client I as you know one of the early people building the actual protocol shouldn't have a say what what client can be built just like ethereum right I want to build a competitor to metamask there's not some approval process that said well metamask was the first wallet or you know one of the first wallets so we're going to actually decide whether wallets can come in now rainbow coinbase wallet you know anyone can go build a wallet on top of a network like ethereum and I think that makes ethereum stronger for it so that's the other bar we want to hit with forecaster so you own your own audience or that relationship belongs to you and as a developer your relationship with your users and the data completely permissions I think that was a really great exploration into some of the shortcomings of the current web 2 world and and Dan I know that you say there's not much broken about web 2 there's only things that we can like learn and build upon but I think in your answer just now uh to the answer to a answer to the question of what's broken about web 2 is actually kind of like the shareholder Equity incentive structure uh because that's what created a bunch of uh monopolistic tendencies that you just listed out from Twitter and Facebook where Twitter began as a very open ecosystem with apis to enable third-party creators but due to what Twitter is a web 2 company any sort of thing of value that got built by somebody else was simply absorbed into Twitter and eventually that aggregation and centralization and monopolization uh created the Twitter the closed form of Twitter that we see today and same thing with Zynga and Facebook so maybe maybe to answer what's broken about web 2 is actually like the traditional Equity structure that a lot of these normal companies are kind of built into and and so I want to ask a question like we can ask the question what's broken about web 2 and and what does web 3 do to fix this I want to ask this in a slightly different way um there's a very early implementation of uh ethereum was peepeth which was Twitter on ethereum where we could just say oh we can make Twitter but web3 will take Twitter we'll copy and paste it and we'll put it on ethereum and then boom we have decentralized Twitter that really that really never took off but maybe under a forecaster kind of structure that might be able to work but there's one there's one aspect of this conversation which is how can we just take systems that already exist Twitter Facebook and then make them decentralized in uh in a more open environment but also what does web 3 native social networks enable that web 2 social networks will never really be able to enable so there's like some conversations which are like we can a decentralized web3 version of Twitter can help with making sure that people don't get de-platformed but that's only about fixing web 2's faults what about these these more decentralized social networks what can they really enable that web 2 will never really be able to enable what's the unique properties what unique properties about web free social will web 2 never really be able to have so I want to start with first the going back to this idea of developers having permissionless access to the data and apis I think that in itself is underrated in that if you allow developers complete freedom to do whatever they want they're they're unbounded in terms of if they have a creative idea they can go they can go do it and then they have to convince other people to use it as a separate thing but there are no API terms of service that they necessarily need to worry about and I I think that alone is is actually an important thing and whether you call that out oh you could build that in web 2 or web3 it put it to the side is like that just existing is a primary motivation for for building something like forecaster as it relates to more specific features around cryptocurrencies um we can talk a couple we have one today so we actually allow you to connect another wallet within forecaster and so you can kind of have a native news feed of what the people you're following who you know you're following them for their Twitter like content right like small text posts but also what's happening on chain and so you're kind of getting this Blended news feed of the kind of stuff that they're talking about but then also what people are actually doing on the blockchain which it natively starts to create uh conversational points around anything that you are doing on chain right you mentioned nft now that natively shows up in the feed which now nfts instead of being this kind of single player thing can now be more multiplayer um composability of feeds exactly so that and then I think that the other thing uh forecasters uh namespace account right like the way you kind of Define yourself is also an nft and so that's going to be in ethereum one next year and and so then you get all the composability that can happen with an nft so you could have an account that's owned by a group of people right and and you could have an erc20 token associated with that and and I don't know use a nouns Dow style governance like it's just like the the possibilities are endless in terms of ownership of a given account so there's going to be a lot of composable stuff that will happen there and then I think the other important thing is every user on farcaster by definition has a working public and private key happens to be an ethereum address and if you think about what that all of a sudden starts to enable you can out of the box have end-to-end encrypted uh direct messaging that is as good a signal and in some ways better because you don't need to have a phone number associated with it uh another example that you can start to kind of think about because there's a lot of development that's happening in zero knowledge proofs is you kind of have all these academic potential uses of zero knowledge proofs that now can be developed permissionlessly by any developer because you can make the strong assumption that every user already has a live working public and private key and so you could potentially make new types of of speech that is kind of like based on some amount of on-chain credential but at the same time you don't necessarily have to reveal uh who who you are so a a basic example would be I own a crypto punk I want to actually be able to say something uh anonymously but but have the credibility to say I own a crypto book if that's something that matters to you but you could imagine other types of on-train credentials that that could be I don't know around politics or around uh medicine and and now I could be a doctor who is well regarded right maybe maybe I've won some prestigious metal in in the field and I want to speak up about something in in medicine but I feel like if I was to do that under my real name uh I would I would get you know a lot of pushback from the community versus I could say something have the credential that is provable on chain and actually do that in a zero knowledge way so I think those Primitives are going to allow developers to have um just kind of a lot of creativity in what they built and so we're really focused on building the core level set of Primitives and then really trying to make it a developing developer platform that you know you build uniswap you get units or sorry you build ethereum then you eventually get uniswap or openc and you start to get people's creativity is actually what drives drives the growth in the use cases okay Dan we're definitely appearing at the top of this uh very large rabbit hole which is this whole entire conversation of uh more decentralized social networks uh and we've touched on a bunch of different possible like paths that we can go down I want to go back to one that we've already started to go down I really want to drive this point home because I think it is at the basement of what is a very large stack of cool awesome expressivity of developers and users on top of it and it goes back to what you said about assurances around like the open API structure or like the assurances that developers can develop on this platform and not get rugged because that's that's a big talking point about like even even like Facebook's uh like changing or closing down their apis this conversation goes back to like why does ethereum exist to build Unstoppable applications and this also is a very core property a very core theme of what we often frequently talk about at bankless which is settlement assurances we use the term settlement assurances to describe property rights like uh why is ethereum and Bitcoin different than like Litecoin or insert your faster smaller blockchain here it's because of settlement assurances you are assured that your property is yours because of the of how strong the security is on ethereum and all and smart contracts right and so these settlement assurances allow people to think into the future and we've related this conversation to like things like laws with the Supreme Court an executive order is a very fast law out of the president it can get overturned by Congress but if Congress writes a law that can get overturned by the Supreme Court and when the Supreme Court says it's final it is final and what we've created with smart contracts is a new level of finality that gives people settlement assurances to think into the long term and that's the same conversation I'm seeing what you're talking about with creating a developer platform that developers can't get rugged and I want to ask you about what is the what is the difference in the assurances that developers have in this new world and what are the downstream net effects of producing a developer platform where the developers have the assurances that the structures that they build will be around forever like what kind of creativity is unlocked at that point yeah so I want to be clear up front one of the reasons forecasters still invite only is we aren't at that bar internally of what we'd say is like an unruggable platform and we've put a lot of effort in over the last year and we're hopefully getting pretty close we're hoping to have it kind of Midway through this year at a place where forecaster from a developer standpoint is actually permissionless and you know call it unruggable or the idea is you're Sovereign as a developer you will have full access to the data and apis of of the protocol and that's built with something called forecaster hubs right and I actually think it's important to delineate that we only do a minimal amount of stuff on chain and part of that is actually we're trying to keep cost fees and usability uh usability high and costs and fees down and so what we do is when you sign up for an account we actually create that on chain today it's on testnet it will be on ethereum L1 hopefully you know by July and what what's great is as a default every single user on farcaster owns their actual account their identity and to use another example a system like email so if you use a Gmail address you actually don't own that Gmail address Gmail can actually at any time just revoke that Gmail address there is an arbitration you can't Port it to another service now if you're a little bit more sophisticated and you own your own domain you can use G Suite pay a little bit more and then now you have the ability to Port your email so email is a uh technically it does work in that you can Port but the Practical reality is most people use a free email address and actually they don't have to think about it most of the time but if you do run into an edge case where you do get suspended by Google and you lose access to your email that's a really really tough thing with forecaster we're making the decision that every single user no matter how sophisticated they are actually gets a sovereign identity that's going to be on ethereum and we actually use something called like a gasless transaction a meta transaction and we just seamlessly onboard people on on through the forecaster client and we actually think that that's great because it allows both a sophisticated person and a non-sophisticated person just on board just like they would web 2 but behind the scenes they do have the the actual ability to move that identity anywhere they want and within any client they want and so that's actually a foundational component to what the user is on forecaster but more importantly that also gives the developer the assurance that if they convince a user to use their app there is no third party that can come in and say you know like this Twitter example oh sorry we're the one that actually owns the identity we're gonna we're gonna revoke that contrast how to actually a Federated system something like Mastodon you're getting your identity provided to you by a server so if that server wants to revoke your identity unless you're running your own server like it's it's going to be very similar from an email standpoint in that you just lose access to that identity so having the pointer be Sovereign and actually on ethereum L1 we think is worth the cost and the complexity to do that in addition to the composability and I think the general uh benefit that you can get from from having it sovereignly owned on ethereum the getting the the other data in apis to a permissionless state once these kind of hubs exist which you can think of a hub as like the ethereum node but for the forecaster Network the other decision we've made is we are actually going to limit the amount of data per user on the protocol in an effort to keep the requirements of running one of these hubs reasonable for an average developer and so you can think of it like this uh we're going to cap you at the equivalent of 10 000 tweets we call them Cass so on the ten thousand and first you know cast we bump your oldest one out at the protocol level and that's the implementation for the Hub and so some people might be like oh well I you know I wish we could have all of it but the nice thing one all the data is permissionless so you could back it up to our Weaver ipfs that's you can you can do that yourself but the benefit that you do get in kind of making this bounded data per user is we really think we can get up to 100 independent hubs that are running which are all going to have a full Global state of the network in the same way that if you're running in a full ethereum node you're going to have full Global State and that ability for a developer forces the network from a kind of like we can't be a bad actor as the kind of initial developers and having the biggest client we can't say oh well we're going to gate this stuff because we've actually intentionally built the protocol in a way that I can be you know two years from now as an independent developer I can spin up a hub and I can actually have the full Global state of what the forecaster protocol is in a given point and we think it's worth a bunch of parallels with this design with how the ethereum protocol is designed which makes me think that you're onto something here we I I've been in crypto for 10 years um I I think ethereum is the right balance between decentralization and pragmatism and I think building things that people can use are an underrated thing in crypto I think a lot of people tend to focus in the ideology which is important but what I showed up to work at coinbase and now what I'm doing with forecasters I want to build a protocol that has a billion plus people using it but I want to do it in a way that doesn't compromise on on the decentralization and the sovereignty at the user account level maybe it's a Fool's iron but that's what we're trying to do that's super cool this idea of um building a social platform that is rugless um not bankless but rugless which maybe that's another podcast we spin up at some point in time David but um I I think I think devs will appreciate that particularly devs who kind of look at sort of the the long term um I think that the BET here you're making is that I mean when Twitter destroyed its apis it essentially destroyed all of its permissionless Innovation didn't it and the only Innovation could happen like that could happen is innovation that could happen with its uh internal employees by the way they just reduced their head count by 50 so do we think we're going to get any new big features from Twitter anytime soon um we'll see probably not uh but this it creates kind of a permissionless ecosystem and I think that's the bet that permissionless ecosystems win out because you have everybody in the world sort of hacking on this and that you know the best employees and the best developers don't actually work for your company do they they're outside in you know places in you know India or all all part parts around the world um so I get that I think from somebody who's never not a developer somebody who's never been de-platformed before they're still not quite clear on this value proposition entirely and I want to get back to uh David's question of um what's new about web3 like why is it a step improvement from a web 2 social media tool if I haven't been de-platformed yet and I think that's the majority of people listening to this have not been de-platformed from Twitter or from Facebook or from their YouTube account they can imagine imagine it might happen but things would have to get bad dystopian in order to do that and so they don't really see the value proposition of being rugless that's why I want to go back to kind of the um the on-chain features that you're adding with farcaster so um Dan before we entered this um this this episode and started recording uh David and I had an opportunity to go download farcaster on our iOS device right an app type version and for listeners right now I believe Dan this is all kind of private beta so it's invite only and so we asked you were like hey Dan you're coming on can we uh get get the invite link and you send us that thank you um what's interesting about this is I kind of see things that uh social media apps are not providing today right like like the twitters of the world and Instagrams um you have this whole section of events that you were talking about where I just plugged one of my ether dresses in and I can see that I minted the bankless ultrasound money podcast episode it's right in my events queue and I could go look at David's profile and I could see all of the things that he did with his on-chain data and his wallet and that's kind of interesting to me right maybe I set an alert for every time David buys an nft so I can ape in uh because he's got the alpha uh and then and then I that there's this tab called nfts where I can see kind of the nfts at added to my address and you're making this comment about identity well I was actually able to set up an RSA at RSA is my handle on Far Caster right now and you're saying that in the future will be kind of it's smart uh contract driven and it's fully composable with the rest of the on-chain defy nfg nft web 3 ecosystem as well and so we have these kind of Primitives and I guess what I'm saying is I think this is a thesis now that I get into it we're still very early but I think that ever every single social media app is going to need to be redesigned to incorporate on-chain web 3 data sets tokens nfts identity all the Innovation that's happening with in web3 and I think Dan they're going to be super freaking slow to do this and respond and they're going to be leapfrogged by social media applications and platforms that actually do and maybe even they'll find that it's counterproductive to their business model to expand into web3 I'm reminded of like um Instagram right now they just rolled out an nft feature uh guess what there's a 15 to 30 percent tax if you issue an nft on their platform that they take that's a pretty high take rate for uh web3 like we don't do that in crypto do we that's kind of again like yeah we don't do that here and so I guess what I'm saying is um this is early stages but I sort of see when I download something like forecaster I get like the Twitter experience but now I have some on-chain data that's added to this and it's starting to become valuable because the big question for me going to a conversation like this Dan is like I know people aren't just going to come for the censorship resistance it's decentralized okay cool I don't care I'm not being de-platformed they will come for the features and to the extent that you are able to innovate faster on those web 3 features and make that valuable then I think we'll start to kind of draw the audience anyway that's how I'm thinking about it what's your take on that uh that thesis all right we completely agree and it's actually one of the reasons we're we're doing both the protocol and the initial client at the same time because our our view was one we could go build the world's best protocol but then we're gonna have to spend a whole bunch of time trying to convince other people to build on top of it and that in of itself is extremely hard and so where we started was hey we're going to build the protocol and the initial client and we're going to do a whole bunch of hard work to try to figure out features and a set of use cases that are going to get at least some initial group of daily active users because I don't think any other developer is going to want to go build on the protocol if it doesn't already have active users users use software they use clients and so so that's why we started with building our initial client built those initial features and our thesis is if you build the best network for people who are interested in crypto and web 3 that is an amazing initial starting Community especially if you believe that you know we're going to continue to have more stuff that ends up on chain whether that's visible or kind of like behind the scenes in the background that's our bet so we're building a the initial app is a social network for people interested in crypto and web3 and thus the set of features that we've built right if you say GM on forecaster we change the like button to a GM you have the nft features if you actually go to any given nft a crypto punk you can actually see everyone else on farcaster that provably owns that nft right so if you find that there's some Community whether it's on cryptocoven crypto punks that you are interested in finding those other people you can actually just go and follow every single person so you could go take your bankless nft click that as a category and then actually find everyone else on farcaster who minted that nft and so those those types of features are uh for our initial user base highly engaging and and we're going to continue to add more of those and then actually we have a kind of bet that over the course of the next few years you're going to have more and more uh just things uh web3 objects is what we call them just natively represented on chain a mirror post is another great example from the surface to the average user that looks like a medium post right like no different it's it's a bunch of text rendered on a web page but what's cool about a mirror post is you can have the the instantiation of it on our weave like we can permissionlessly pull that into our client in addition there is interactivity with the mirror post because you can mint it and you can trade it and collect it and and so all of that functionality if we're kind of taking web3 as the BET and understanding natively what's happening on chain inside of a social experience you almost start to get all this Innovation that's happening on chain for free right so if you're natively surfacing whatever someone's doing on chain in a social way there's some new use case that pops up you you're now starting to kind of have an initial conversation about it but then you can actually add and make the features even better and so that that that's for sure how we're approaching it and I think a lot of criticism that I've heard about uh forecasters futile to be working on this stuff because it's too cryptocentric our point of view is we'd rather actually focus on what might seem like a niche but a niche that is is the future and for us if if you can actually get the smartest people in crypto engaging in high quality way on this new new Social Network I think you'll naturally start to bring other people who are curious and because they're going to say oh this is you know high quality discourse right vitalik is talking about the need for new institutions on farcaster and he gets 40 replies that are actually thoughtful and not a lot of spam that in itself is also kind of interesting and and so I think for us it's it's very much about we have to build a compelling product that people can use as a way of bootstrapping the actual protocol because if you can get to some semblance whether it's ten thousand or a hundred thousand active users on the protocol then I actually start to think that you're going to get critical mass for developers interested in building other other new applications which may actually increase the the aperture right someone goes builds a very specific app that's dedicated to sports fans we're never going to be the best at that but if someone else has a great idea for that and you already have a hundred thousand people who are actively using the protocol that's your initial seed community and then you bring in people who have no idea that this is all powered by corrupt they're just coming to use that app so the initial use case here for forecaster the focus for from a user Persona like the type of user that you want is like the full nft crypto native type person yep and they're going to want to migrate here because Twitter doesn't have the features doesn't have the on-chain features that they actually want and need for for their communities and not not the censorship resistance because I completely agree with you the reveal preference is most people don't care right like they only care when they eventually get you know booted but for most people that doesn't happen so Twitter actually works for them right now so you have to have better features you don't care Dan that right now the criticism people say is yeah but the crypto native population is so small I mean what are we talking about maybe millions of people how many daily active users does metamask have that's kind of your target market basically your response to that is I don't care because that number's going up and it's going up real fast basically I think that and um people who are building the future are inevitably that's where where people are going to want to spend time and I think if you were to look at early Twitter in 2007 2008 it was a bunch of tech nerds in San Francisco who are going to South by Southwest and that was the criticism it's like okay this is just a bunch of nerds who who would want to like share what they're having for breakfast these people are narcissists and and maybe there's some truth to people who use Twitter I use Twitter a lot that they're narcissists but the reality is it turns out there are a lot of people in the world who find that interesting even if they're not into Tech it just took 10 years to get there we're about 10 years out from threatening democracies is what you're saying with our paper my goal is to not have a threaten democracy but yes I think things that are that kind of impact massive impact things that are big look small and are very easy to ridicule and I mean I saw this at coinbase like I my I was there in 2014 2015 2016 and so many people are like why are you wasting your time on bitcoin like oh like did Bitcoin die like all that stuff right and actually ethereum was what really kick-started I think the second chapter for coin days and then after the kind of like 2017 hype cycle it was clear that like crypto wasn't going to go away at least to smart people um and I think you've had multiple Cycles um but I think generally I think that that's the same thing is going to happen for for decentralized social networks is people are going to say that oh they're a toy they're never going to hit scale like you know it's impossible to beat Facebook and all this kind of stuff but look I mean if people say that you can't like compete with Facebook one Tick Tock went from zero to whatever it is today in a very short period of time and and Facebook really hasn't been able to compete with that so A that's a that's a counter example that you can compete and then two we're seeing this how even now like people said last year Google is you can't compete with Google and then all of a sudden chat GPT shows up and then people are like oh my goodness like this is going to replace Google and I think that's probably overblown but but if you're working in technology and you're working in in an area where there's just constant Innovation and and things are getting pushed forward to have the point of view that that we're just going to be in this stasis where it's like impossible to beat the big guys people used to say that about Microsoft and IBM and and so it's like it's just like a lack of history for for most of these folks and so I'm I'm completely fine being ignored for a while all I want to do is make incremental progress every week grow grow the user base five percent every week find people who are interested in the features that we're building right these crypto native features that aren't being built on other social networks and this is the home for them and over time I think that the the market gets big enough and unfortunately I think we have a long-term perspective on that it worked for coinbase and hopefully it works for forecaster this uh Ryan reminds me of um Chris Dixon's take that he had when we were talking to him way back when about how a16z used to be called an internet fund and then it just became a fund Because the Internet took over and his take was that that's going to be the same thing for crypto it's like first a16t's got like a crypto fund but that's just going to take over what venture capital is because everything's gonna become on crypto and I think that's the same take that Dan is leading with is like there's a population of Highly engaged crypto people uh that crypto populations up only and in the future fast forward 5-10 years the crypto people are just the internet goers that we know of today um Dan there's a there's a I want to drill down into this client-centric design of a decentralized social network because my take coming into this podcast is that there's actually no way to produce a decentralized social network without it being a client-centric ecosystem and also something you said uh earlier is about like uh we can we can create like a specific thing for sports fans that's built on Far caster and it's so it's optimized for them they don't even know that it's crypto and this also goes back to what we were talking about earlier with like the open model for Twitter or Facebook where there was like an app ecosystem and anyone can build on top of Twitter the the take the belief I have is that that kind of open design allows for these systems to adapt and flex to the wants of their users like when many many developers can build on top of something they will build something that's fundamentally useful or or it's not and they stop building it or it is and they continue building it and they continue refining it but first and foremost it takes that uh open model that open API model that open design model to actually allow for developers to kind of believe that there's something useful there that they want to build and then go build it and in stark contrast to the current web 2 model the current web 2 world where like if you open up Twitter on the browser and then you open up Twitter on the phone it's the same Twitter same thing with Facebook like if you open up Facebook on the internet facebook.com or the Facebook the app it's the same Facebook but like I'm my intuition tells me that something with a decentralized social network that's a very client-heavy ecosystem is that it can change shape it can change form based off of how you want it to be or who you are or the clients that you're using because you want to engage with it in a particular way can you elaborate on this like unique property of a decentralized social network and I'm actually having uh trouble understanding what you mean by client-centric what does that even mean maybe the question for David and Dan too yeah so the way I think about it is um we want to build an internet scale protocol internet scale protocol protocol is going to have billions of people using it and there are going to be many apps and services built on top of it in order to get the many apps and services built on top of it to have those billions of people you need developers interested in building developers are going to build on the thing that makes it easy for them to find users right the reason people build on mobile app stores despite the 30 tax and all the ringer moral that they make you go through is when you have a phone it's attached to your body when you're a daily active user of a phone so it's this amazing platform to be able to build get someone on you know to install your app then you have push notifications and so Apple has been able to bootstrap a huge ecosystem by virtue of actually just getting people to buy their phones and then hold them in on their body all the time so we wanted to take the same approach where the the way to Kickstart the forecaster ecosystem is build the initial client build some of these features that get people into the door A lot of people didn't find them that interesting but there were enough people that found them interesting that we were able to kind of create an initial kernel of users highly engaged users that once you hit a certain amount of conversational liquidity so if you think of like D5 you need like tvl or whatever that for social networks is especially a public social network if I open up the app is there something new to see right and if it's too uh stale then you're just going to have people turn whereas if you can kind of beg borrow and steal whatever you need to do to actually bootstrap that initial Community then what you can do is use the the initial client to continue to onboard people continue to grow the total number of addressable users on the protocol but you're going to have developers start to Tinker around because now there's all this data and they're all these users and so we've seen you know a whole bunch of different apps built on top of the initial set of forecaster apis which I think are really really bad but it just shows you that there's a lot of demand people love playing around with the stuff because they didn't have to ask us for anything they can just once once they you know want to build it they can just just go and do it and it'll only get better later this year when we have hubs and we hit the bar around permissionlessness but I think the um to go back to this kind of like why why we think the the client ecosystem is so important to get right it goes back to your to your point of or rather if you think about what the heart thing is when building a social network yes it's coming up with some novel new mechanic and idea but the there are plenty of examples of people having built social networks with with the mechanic maybe you know five years too early or whatever and it's it's not on the Merit of the idea it's all about distribution and getting users and and so what we're trying to do is dramatically reduce the difficulty in in having an app that's that has social features people are already going to have an identity they don't need to be onboarded again they're going to potentially have all this public data because it's it's a network like Twitter uh that you could potentially use machine learning to figure out what their preferences are right so I I could if I built that Sports client right that's like if you're really into football and you had already talked about that you're a I don't know Vikings or a Giants fan in one of your casts before I programmatically can kind of go look back and then when you open up the app it's like it already Auto suggests what you're interested in and so this access to the the like foundational identity the the the actual data like you know what you're posting what you're liking who you're following all that information that is available another developer can actually use to bootstrap their new app and so making it easier dramatically easier for new social apps to be built because as a user I don't need to resign up for like the whole I the whole system and then similarly like they they can actually do a lot of intelligent stuff based on all the publicly available data gets you to a place where it can be a shared layer of identity of the data and then actually the other thing about it is you can now use it for distribution right and so we we actually just had an app come out this weekend still early stage called absorb and what they're doing is they're using the forecaster protocol to post seven second videos in an you know oh Divine and the way it works in our client it's going to show up where it says I just posted a video to absorb click here and we don't even have video in our client yet we just haven't gotten around to putting that in there but if you were to open up absorb it's actually going to show you all the other posts that are on the the forecaster protocol that follow that format in a very Vine or tick-tock-like way and so it's it's using a subset of the protocol for all the kind of like Primitives that is available to it but then then it can actually just build a completely new experience and and let's say that app starts to get bigger maybe there are plenty of people who use that app who don't even know that it's using forecaster or crypto it's just like oh cool this is like some app where you have a bunch of people doing what they're doing and maybe they come up with some new novel mechanic that's slightly different from Vine or Tick Tock that does really well with a certain segment of users great that's all benefiting the forecaster protocol and they're benefiting from the broadcaster protocol as well so it's pretty simple out I mean I get all this and that's why I was kind of uh questioning David like why uh why you called this a client-centric uh design because to me that's not that's it's protocol Centric really what Dan is saying is we're doing the base protocol so that anyone can build a client on top of it we're just bootstrapping the very first client in order to get people that's like our Bootloader for the client but the value is really is kind of the protocol it's like as if Twitter released uh the Twitter website in the app in the early days and then also a protocol that anyone could build on top of that was a completely rugless where it's as if RSS you know RSS didn't pick pick up in many ways when RSS was first introduced well maybe that was because RSS there was never a kind of a a company developing the first client for RSS and kind of like acting as a bootloader so that that's why I was asking David why you called it a client-centric design don't you mean like protocol Centric design yes yeah protocol Centric as in there's one far Caster protocol I guess what I meant by client-centric is that whereas Twitter and Facebook are highly monopolistic and don't encourage a uh expressivity in having many many many clients forecaster does and so it's putting clients as like yo we need clients we if clients need to be a first-class citizen because there's many different ways to access the farcaster protocol and each client can pick and choose their own particular way of of accessing the forecaster protocol and those different choices will be determined by the users of that particular client but it's really like forecaster winning like a thumb war in like protocol design whereas like in theory there could be a forecaster protocol and then there could be like the Facebook of forecaster and the Twitter of forecaster like these things can become apps and the fact that farcaster is a protocol is like you could have the Twitter app that is built on top of the far craster protocol so yes Ryan you're right when it's there's like uh protocol Centric but the idea of a Cambrian explosion of specific clients that are built for specific purposes for specific audiences is what's missing from the web 2 world that makes it so like stagnant and stale and monopolistic Dan does all this stuff check out yeah and maybe to marry the two together I would say it's the protocol is only good as the CL as good as the clients that are available for it right because you could have technically brilliant protocol but if there's no way for people to use it and use it like in a really highly usable way that they can install on their home screen right because it is actually a battle for your thumbs are you going to hit Instagram or Twitter or you're going to hit forecaster or some other app that's built on top of it that that's Zero Sum social like time is a zero something and that's what you're competing for in Social and so in order to make the protocol useful you need at least one client right and one client that's hopefully driven a whole bunch of users then I actually think the protocol it's kind of a flywheel right so it's now you've actually bootstrapped it with some users now the protocol starts to be more attractive for other people to build clients and then hopefully it kind of ping pongs back and forth there whereas the more clients and more diversity of clients and different experiences you have the more growth you're going to have for the protocol the more gross with the protocol the more people are interested in building clients and so I think that is where we have been really really focused and and what might differentiate us from others is we we plan to work on our client like this initial bootstrapping client for a very long time if not forever because I think for us it forces us to dog food the protocol that we're expecting other people to build on and so it's inevitably we are going to know the pain points and the frustrations as a developer it's like wow this is really hard how could we if we can't do it ourselves or this is a pain they ask for us to do why would we expect anyone else to go through this like they're just probably going to go build build somewhere else and so by being kind of like putting ourselves as a developer on the protocol it it it it makes the protocol better because we're developing the protocol but it also going back to what makes the protocol successful it's getting users to use the protocol who become addressable users for other apps on the protocol and so so that that's where I think the the client and protocol aspects of the designer are critical and they they're very intertwined uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social adapts like Reddit are also now calling arbitrim home both arbitrum 1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with the arboretum's recent migration to Arbitron Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free I think web2 users which I know is everyone uh can really resonate with this um with this with this like not this like fixed state of the web 2 world like why hasn't there been like a new web 2 app that's come out in the last like decade we almost had um what was that the the audio Clubhouse we almost had Clubhouse Clubhouse took us by storm in the middle of covid like we almost had a new one but then what did what happened like Twitter just absorbed that feature into their Monopoly of Twitter and took away that like Dan you've been calling these like this cool new mechanism that it justifies like a new like social media app but then all of these like web 2 companies just like absorb those features into like their like larger centralized stack and I think one of the things that you alluded to is that as the far Caster protocol grows in users and utility when somebody triggered like thinks up of a new mechanism like Clubhouse did uh that can be appended to the forecasted protocol via a client but not actually have to compete with the other clients on forecaster because everyone is contributing to the growth of this protocol and so it's a little bit like how I view the ethereum layer 2 ecosystem like when optimism wins and grows users in tvl like their net overflow of that also benefits all the other layer twos on ethereum so like that's net beneficial to Arbitron because when our when optimism finds a new user like they're just one hop away from arbitrum and that's just not true in the web 2 world when Facebook finds a new user it comes out of the detriment of Twitter but I see this like Festival of the commons of forecaster is when somebody triggers a invents like some cool new mechanism that's brand new that can become an app on top of the far Caster protocol and actually grow the utility of the protocol at large and hopefully that is what unlocks a brand new like Cambrian explosion of cool new social features that exists on the Internet is that what you see yeah and and so going back to I would give Tick Tock is probably the one counter example to the last 10 years but but other than that I I and maybe snap if you want to go back that far but very few right um I think the way to think about client competition on something like forecaster so so let's you know someone comes up the clubhouse equivalent on forecaster and we have this initial client and has a lot of users and so if we try to do the same thing that Twitter did with spaces right um the the advantage Twitter had with spaces is not spaces was a better product spaces had more distribution right so if you do a spaces uh for Bank list versus a clubhouse or bankless you already have a huge audience on Twitter right and so I can guarantee you if YouTube did a spaces product or obviously they have it it's like YouTube live but something equivalent it would also be really popular because there's a lot of existing users and distribution and I think what's key with forecaster is so if someone goes and clones you know one of the bigger apps on the ecosystem clones the the kind of up and coming the one who innovated they have to continue to keep Pace because the distribution is actually put at the protocol level so now as a user if if I actually want to listen to the equivalent of a Like You Know audio room that is at the forecaster protocol level I can actually choose the best client rather than have to say oh do I want to choose the distribution or the feature set and so you can actually get both where the client that you opt into has the feature set but you can still have access to the entire social graph and and in distribution and and so going back to this idea of monopolistic Tendencies it forces clients to actually have to be extremely responsive to users because otherwise someone's going to get their attention right and and so from our standpoint look we have you know 99 market share today because we're the initial client there are a whole bunch of other clients being built right now and as we build the ecosystem out and make it easy for users to actually move between clients I consider it a huge success if we only end up having 10 or 20 share assuming we've grown the forecaster protocol because that to me is the success of the protocol and then we're going to end up with a better ecosystem because these apps are going to be competing on feature set not distribution and like um proprietary lock-in where I think that that's where we've gotten a lot of the reason things are so stagnant right Instagram had this whole controversy recently where they're adding more videos to compete with Tick Tock and you had a whole bunch of users a lot of high profile users even being like we don't like this like we want to have it be more like the traditional Instagram where it's photos or stories and the the beauty of a system like forecaster is if the equivalent of Instagram is built on forecaster and has a massive audience assuming it's on the protocol you can actually go build the traditional Instagram client which actually someone did and what did Instagram do they sued them for for access to the API and then got them kicked out of the App Store whereas in this system it'll be like oh this is a better client I'm gonna go shift over there and two examples like this exist in in the web one world so the first is uh browsers Netscape starts at Internet Explorer crushes them through a variety of uh kind of underhanded tactics through bundling and then what happens is Firefox comes out and Firefox without any huge budget or anything wins a massive amount of market share on the Merit of just being a better browser and the beauty of the web is I can go you you know there was no lock-in of IE for the most part and then Google comes along and says well we're going to build a better browser than than uh you know Firefox and and got a lot of share whereas now with these mobile app stores essentially Apple and Google can actually force and actually more Apple than Google because I think Android's a little bit more open here Apple basically can say we're the only the browser on on iOS like Chrome is like based on this wrapper on top of some apis but they don't get like full system access and then the second one is superhuman can come along and just be like we we are literally giving you the same effective set of data that exists on Gmail but we're going to build a product that's so productive for the people who who are excited about that and we're going to charge 30 a month or whatever they charge and and they can go do that because email by definition is kind of this permissionless thing where I can actually move my my data between different clients and so that's that's what we want to get to with fargaster we're the best clients the the biggest clients are winning on the merits of their features not some lock-in that they then can kind of extract right like the classic example I always use with web 2 if it's not even social is airbnb's cleaning fees they're able to do that because it's like they built this huge Marketplace and brand and most consumers aren't going to go try to go find the other things that exist out there and so then they can kind of just keep turning the dial and and not having to really respond to the market versus if you imagine that as a protocol right like the ability to have the inventory as a protocol and then the trust and safety which is actually the hard thing to go do but if you can actually get that to a protocol and I haven't even thought about like how you'd actually go do that but imagine if that was more of a protocol then you'd have the best clients all competing on it right and that's actually in some ways if you think about flights a much better example where you used to have hipmunk and Expedia and kayak and Google flights like people can actually compete on that data set um and that's not even a protocol that's just like having open access to data you win on the merits of how functional the software you're building is not not some proprietary login so this all makes sense um but here's the question I'm trying to understand in my mind Dan so um why let's go back to incentives right so um Twitter certainly could have in the early days of Twitter not shut off its API okay it could have been a bit more standard-centric and protocol-centric in its design sure it didn't have crypto but it could have adopted for some kind of Open Standards it could have made itself uh more rugless but the reason they didn't is because they had uh back to David's Point earlier they had Venture capitalists investors to please and the model the monetization model for social is ads and so it was it you one once they establish their moat right it was a good business decision to then pick up the ladder and and pull it up so that no one could kind of come behind them they had no incentive to create this a protocol behind them and to let competitors potential competitors out innovate them because they were incented towards an advertising model in order to maximize the ROI for their investors we understand this this is kind of you know capitalism and uh you know I I can imagine farcaster is not using sort of a Wikipedia model where it's purely like grants funded that's that's the other example of how we've created kind of public goods on the internet so can you tell me about the kind of the incentive incentive mechanism I mean you've been talking about how you're very excited to propagate the uh farcaster protocol and not just the far Caster client but then what further incentive do you have to continue building that protocol I suppose or like don't you want to be the most dominant client in the space are you planning to monetize ties this with ads this is the part I don't understand is how do investors in something like forecaster maintain alignment how do you yourself your team maintain alignment you were talking about I would love to develop our client uh forever like for as long as I can um why what is the monetization what is the incentive mechanism here that keeps you aligned with the public good and the good of the protocol does my question even make sense yeah it makes a total amount of sense and I think that the answer is one it's I can give you the most glib or whatever you know crafted answer and this is something that is only earned through actions over a sustained period of time that people actually believe that I do care about the protocol or Varun and I you know care about making the protocol successful and not just our company's called Merkel manufacturing so making Merkel successful and so the the way we approached it is one Varun and I both worked at coinbase so we had some economic success coming out of coinbase and when we sat down to kind of like work on potential ideas we were both aligned on wanting to work on something for 10 plus years and actually have it be meaningful and great to the point where we could look back when we were 80 and say I'm really proud that I worked on that there are resilient other companies we could have gone worked on that are kind of like very nuts and bolts SAS companies in crypto and probably could have grown it faster and got into Revenue faster or whatever but we just didn't opt for that we wanted to work on something for for 10 plus years that we wanted people to actually kind of say that that's stupid that you're working on that like it's never going to work because I think when you have long time Horizons you can actually accomplish great things the second thing is we bootstrapped the company for the first year and a half not because of lack of investor interest is that we actually wanted to build the initial version of forecaster and how we wanted to build it in in the way we wanted to because again we're relying on the long term here when we did raise money last year and we raise money because one we we thought being able to scale the team a little bit more than we had originally planned would benefit the protocol but two I I got a sense having been through multiple crypto winters at coinbase that we were headed into a down market so we we started fundraising end of April early May of last year right before things imploded so we got lucky on the time but one of the things is we said to all the investors that we we brought on board is we're optimizing for the protocol long term and Varun and I have you know kind of voting control of the company so like basically we're we're in the driver's seat around we can build the company the way we want to do it and our view going back to that kind of analogy is today we have 99 market share or 95 whatever whatever version of that high number you want to pick uh but we have 8 000 people in a beta the goal here is to get to 100 million a billion people on forecaster and if we have 10 percent in in those two cases you have 10 million or 100 million users like that that that that is going to be great and so I think that you have to earn the trust of the developer community in in within the forecaster ecosystem that I think will be majorly earned when we release hubs because then people will actually start to believe like wait a second like I have that the same playing field access to the data and apis that Merkel does with the amount of money that they raise the fact that they were the first in the ecosystem they have the most users and it seems like Merkel is taking their API or their their limited resources in terms of time and staff and building out features to like make it easy for an app developer to install uh you know you you can easily install a new forecaster app and and actually letting people export to a new client and so upholding that standard but I I don't think that there's any deterministic way for anyone to believe that other than if we've been working on it for three four years and and we've consistently made not perfect but consistently made the right long-term decisions around optimizing for the protocol and so that's that's the best answer I can give you is like I believe it and I want to show the world that I do but uh until until we hit a sufficient scale and hubs exist I think it's it's completely reasonable for anyone to be skeptical Dan does it um is it required that a protocol have a token for this um you know to succeed so I'm just you know we've used some analogs of the ethereum foundation for example right and basically if I were to kind of sum up the ethereum foundation and what's done it's it's bootstrapped it's r d development based on the value of eth the token and at some point the idea is that eth may be um ossifies in some way and actually ossifies not the right term uh David what was the other term we were batting around home it goes into homeostasis homeostatic uh where there's less development ongoing development needed and so kind of the ethereum foundation is almost no longer needed as sort of a shepherd and kind of go Fades into the background but they've used the token price to kind of stay aligned with the rest of the ecosystem so they're very aligned with uh you know arbitrary and optimism Layer Two is anyone in D5 because they they have kind of that alignment in the token is it token needed in order to line parties for for something like a decentralized social network or what do you think of that so the way I think about it is the protocol going back to your idea of like how do you bootstrap r d and continue to have a strong protocol that's independent protocol needs a source of Revenue and so the way we are going to actually test this is once we move to midnet we are actually going to have two types of forecaster accounts there's an account that you can kind of register think of it as like you get a numerical ID and you own that forever it's gas only one time so you could do that once and then then you have a forecaster account forever but we think that most people who are engaged on forecaster are going to actually be willing to pay some amount of money we're going to test it at 10 roughly 10 a year worth of ethereum directly to a contract that is kind of like the protocol treasury contract and if if we're right about that hypothesis could be wrong but if we're right then the protocol is actually going to have a sustainable yearly Revenue Source into perpetuity that's something that email doesn't have or DNS or any of these other things that were kind of more academic and then got captured by a lot of a lot of the large internet companies and so by having a revenue source of the protocol now the protocol can actually start to hire its own you know team and and actually get outside of like whether Merkel manufacturer or other big companies in the space are are actively contributing the protocol like we still want to but like I want to get to a place where the protocol can actually really be independent and then at that point I think it it's worth figuring out depending on how many users you have and how engaged people are is how do you actually decentralize the core governance of that strategy away from the initial team right and so I I have like kind of this very pragmatic or give myself credit on the pragmatism I I'm rooted in pragmatism most of the time and my view is if we focus on the decentralization of the governance to early we're going to spend way more time talking about like what the systems and processes should be versus actually making progress and and the thing that matters is like we need to have a million or 10 million people who've signed up for this thing improving people are willing to pay for the protocol and all this other stuff before we can worry about getting getting to those other things again you don't never want to lead without governments right you're just going to move slower and and so for our like there's a term in open source software development which is not what we want to do but benevolent dictator for life that's what Linus tour Falls is right I think ours is benevolent dictator until product Market fit and then actually turn it in over to the the protocol and and look some people say oh well what's your incentive you're going to get there and you're going to want to you know hold on to control for yourself yeah that would be the Bitcoin of response but the reality is if if I wanted to do control why would I be spending all this this time on the protocol stuff like I could be moving way faster 50 80 of my engineering versus on the team right now are spent on on the protocol and so like this is the thing I don't have to commit server on this all I have to convince are an increasing number small but but steady group of people who are like buying into the vibe on forecaster and that's fine because if we can continue to show that we can grow it we will get more and more permissionless over time and I'm fine with that and and so I'm not walking around saying forecasters permissionless and all this stuff if that is aspirational at this point but when we hit that bar I'll be very happy to kind of pound my chest and say hey we've had we've hit these these milestones and we do have actually a lot of decentralization and it is rugless but until then it's it's more aspirational and and it's like we're actively investing resources in it but I I don't think it's intellectually honest for any anyone to be claiming that if if you haven't actually hit the threshold no that's cool that's pretty grounded yeah that was kind of the root of my question right because like what what you're looking for if you're if you're doing a protocol is sort of a public sector in a private sector right and both need to be funded and if we think about kind of you know governments everyone's familiar with uh obviously their nation state and they're familiar with taxes and then they're familiar with uh you know businesses and so what you're saying is basically the forecasted protocol could be configured in such a way that it has some sort of lightweight tax type system to pay for the public goods which is when maybe when you register your name or something there's you know ten dollars in each per year and this goes into a fund and if you multiply that by a large number of users then you actually have a pretty good tax base in order to fund the public goods the you know the roads and the hospitals of course not those things literally in this case but the the public goods that everyone will share now what you haven't figured out which uh to be fair no one in crypto has figured this out is how to actually govern that uh Treasury and make sure that it's managed effectively of course like in the you know nation state quite famously have large bureaucracies that sort of kind of do this work um maybe crypto will develop something around that though that's kind of the hope I mean we are working on these get coin type governance uh quadratic voting types of things and something might come along but that was the root of my question so you in in in a fully realized forecaster you have this public sector but then you have this private sector of all of these various clients that are creating businesses based on the the public infrastructure and are competing with one another in a way but they're also contributing towards the the network effect of the protocol and even their contributing tax revenue to the protocol to the extent they're able to onboard users um that seems to me like a pretty grounded approach and uh does not necessarily require a token at the base layer although maybe that's a design strategy as well when you think about governance uh very helpful thank you yeah and I think in some ways it's an improvement on web one um which you always have to be careful about because like obviously web one has been incredibly successful but I do think if you think about whether it's I don't know HTTP DNS SMTP the fact that those protocols don't have a built-in Revenue Source despite billions of people using them you have to run them as non-profits that don't have any funding whatsoever basically or get funding from the big internet companies who then get to decide what the standards are and what we want 100 things like that right and so so like a good example of like web authen which is like um this new like touchless way of signing into things um they don't allow like arbitrary signing of like ecdsa curves or whatever like and and and if you wanted to actually get that done it's this incredibly bureaucratic process run by you know kind of middle management at like the biggest browser manufacturers and in a world where governance is a little bit more decentralized and and then like there is actually a revenue Source directly to the protocol one the protocol hopefully is independent so that it can actually make its own decisions what's best for the protocol but more importantly if you actually get to a a good solution for decentralized governance if you want to have more influence there you're going to figure out okay this is the path to actually doing that versus this kind of opaque big company like the fact that Microsoft Apple and Google can kind of get together and be like ah maybe we won't add this feature to the web browsers like and and people be like oh that's a conspiracy theory and then it turned out like when Steve Jobs was around they weren't recruiting Engineers from each other because like they big companies do do that um so I don't know like I I think call me naive but I I do think having these public goods have a funding source is is a improvement over the the status quo oh actually I agree it's like so long as we can govern them effectively in a you know uncorruptable way I I guess just last piece here then you back to kind of the business model for a second so remember that public private kind of uh relationship we just described and the clients themselves would be the private sector here and I suppose you would be open to all sorts of new models on the client side that web3 enables so back to my early example of Twitter the only model the only way for them to appease their shareholders and make money and return value to the investors which is necessary by the way let's not live in a naive world where investors invest in things with that without expect expectation of maximizing their upside but um you you could have things that aren't maybe ad Revenue funded for example in the clients so nfts like a client you can imagine on farcaster maybe it you'll get some kind of transaction fee type revenue for the amount of posts or the amount of nfts that are sold uh inside of the inside of the client or um you know maybe there's some other token funding apparatus that is more web 3 native and less eyeball Centric uh we you know make money based on the number of eyeballs we get in this system so I guess that private sector is even more diverse than the web 3 social which just like depends on attention as the currency depends on Advertising as the the sponsor of everything where all users become the product yeah so I fully expect there to be clients in the forecast for ecosystem that use advertising it's the reveal preference of billions of consumers they like free and they're willing to have their attention taken by an ad I don't think all ads are bad either um but I think what we're planning to do with our client so I can speak to that is we're going to have a freemium model so we're going to actually have subscriptions and our strategy is to keep our team extremely small like from a core team so our general expenses are going to be pretty low and we think that within a reasonable number of years in terms of growth if we continue to grow five percent every week we we will get to a place where we're Break Even we're profitable based on some percentage of users willing to subscribe for the kind of like Pro subscription right um and I think subscriptions in 2022 are much more like more normalized for consumers to say hey I'm actually spending a lot of time in this app I'm willing to subscribe a few dollars a month to the more like premium version of that and so that's something we're going to test I think you you're spot on in that if your feed has a bunch of stuff that's happening on chain there's a natural economic model with that and one example I always bring up a lot of people don't realize Apple gets paid 20 billion dollars a year by Google for the default search placement in Safari on on iOS that's got to be pretty profitable uh it's their highest profit margin line of business there's no cost it's it's literally it's just you know you can either be DuckDuckGo Bing or or Google and Google pays 20 billion because you can change it it's not like it's like the only option and so that that's an amazing model when you have some amount of scale right like you know obviously apple has a lot of scale but uh firefox's entire budget basically is just the fact that they have the user base that they do and Google pays to be the default little search bar in Firefox and so and now you realize why Chrome is so valuable because they don't have to pay themselves that but um in our case we have the nfts you could imagine our client saying okay what's the default if you click on a link in an nft where does it go and and now you potentially have different marketplaces being willing to bid on that or if you mention a cryptocurrency it's like where you're going to trade it and and so I I think the the the idea space for this kind of like transaction based Commerce is something that was frankly and maybe Elon fixes this with Twitter I don't want to count them out but Twitter is this kind of like feed of information and the ability for you to like tap in two things and then buy a recommended you know someone tweets a link to the wire cutter like why why isn't there a deal where you're surfacing that product review right in the feed not not oppressively it's like I'm interested in this click it opens up and then I can actually do the Commerce right there I think that there's just a whole idea space that can happen there and then the beauty is people are inventing new things in crypto all the time that are going to have natural built-in economic models and so what I would like to get to is a place where basically we never have to have ads because we figured out other ways to monetize and also kept our cost structure really lean but even in that case like you can imagine maybe when we have 10 million or 100 million people there's a tier of user that's like hey I actually just want the Bare Bones completely free and then maybe you're showing them some some simple simple ad but like no by no means are we interested in doing that in the near term and and here's the beauty of the protocol if that's the wrong decision some other app is going to come along offer all the same features they're going to offer an ad based product ad based client and the reveal preference of users will they'll use it and then we'll have to confront and potentially change that so I think that that is a world that I want to live in where we can run these experiments and let the market decide rather than you know you make a decision 14 years ago and actually I think with Twitter now that they're not public and they're owned by one person they're actually having an opportunity to rethink that business model and if you were to ask me what what is a Twitter that is not on by Elon today it's they made the Bold decision early on that they weren't going to monetize like Facebook and instead they were going to say hey we're going to monetize better than any online newspaper right because we know the these people who are really into Twitter probably willing to pay twenty thirty dollars a month and and and maybe they didn't have six thousand people they had 1200 people or or whatever but I I think um from first principles I think you can get to a reasonable uh profitable business with a subscription model that you don't even assume most people subscribe to like assuming you just are really really efficient in terms of keeping your head count lean Dan this has been such a great exploration into the into the world of the future of social media networks and I'm pretty sure listeners or imaginations are probably running wild right now there's a few more um conversations I just want to quickly check the box of uh just to as we wrap this up uh one is like what is the actual on-chain footprint of this thing like it's not its own blockchain correct and I want to I want to make sure that that gets communicated but what are the actual crypto things that are about farcast or what is its footprint in the world of of crypto yeah so you have two two parts on chain today it's on ethereum testnet it's on girly and it's moving to mainnet hopefully halfway through this year and you sign up you get a an FID a forecaster ID and it's just an incrementing number so if you're the 10 000 user that's that's your number that's largely abstract away from people but that's actually critical for the whole system to work then there's an optional 10 a year kind of like username like kind of premium account but but effectively that those are the two Primitives that is also an nft so that can actually be permissions they put into anything in erc721 works with openc you can put it on I don't know pseudo swap you can use a party bid completely composable so wait my account is an nft yes I hope you got a good username there dude well I hope I don't lose it no no you won't lose it were any any active user uh during the test step we're gonna migrate to mainnet on on our donkey um but then but then it's ten dollars a year just like it would be if you own a domain uh to pay and you pay directly to the protocol um but yeah like that that is the core primitive on on ethereum uh relatively simple set of smart contracts but the the core of the whole system is all mapped to that right so if I post something from dwr which is my username every time that happens there are servers that are effectively checking ethereum to make sure that the public key which is an ethereum address that you know matches the private key that signs that content and it all just magically works cool and then the other uh question I want to talk about is the world of content moderation and spam prevention as someone who has been absolutely hounded by Twitter Bots lately how does spam prevention work in a decentralized network like does it is are you just opening yourself up to spam attacks so one of the things again small team and we're just trying to focus on what we think are the most important priorities first is it's gated to sign up and we actually took inspiration from Facebook on this Facebook's still the largest social network in the world and for the first two two and a half years it was gated to.edu email addresses and our our approach is we need to get hubs out we need to get to ethereum mainnet and then the second half of this year it's figure out how do you get to completely permissionless operating and then then I think you start to hit a bar where okay the protocol is actually permissionless but as a result of that we haven't had any spam issues for the most part because everyone right now has to come through my Twitter DM and that's not sustainable long term we're moving away from that but I think that that's allowed us to a keep the community small and incrementally grow rather than have it grow too fast people kind of turn and then it feels like a ghost town and I think the long-term solution and this is not fully baked so there's a little bit of a punt here but I think the the high level answer is uh something like pagerank which you know Powers Google is as the social networks develops and you've kind of had time for kind of the active users you can actually start to map any given user on the network how they interact with all the other users and it gets very difficult for a spammy account to you know penetrate the core of the network in a way that if you uh basically get good on your kind of machine learning data science you could potentially even publish that information so that any client out of the box can get actually decent spam filtering with the caveat that that client can choose hey actually I don't think this account is spammy or whatever so they can they can modulate how they want to approach content moderation I also think that what's important is similar to email uh which everyone uses content moderation and emails we just call it spam filtering it's a client level decision versus the network level decision which is it it relatively straightforward the only thing you can store in forecaster is text like 320 character little tweet like things and so the amount of stuff that you can actually put on there that is really bad from like an image standpoint and video content is relatively limited that's it you could still put some nasty stuff in 320 characters but inevitably what you're going to have is you're going to have clients who are going to do the same thing they would do with emails as they're going to say okay we're going to not allow hate speech or abuse or all this other stuff but that will again be a client level feature um which is which is how the internet works right it's like how the web works like Google doesn't have to index your web page but that doesn't mean your web page went offline so even if it's full of deplorable stuff Google just takes it out of the index you just get no distribution right and I think that that is the content moderation gets wrapped up in the fact that today most of the platforms we're talking about from content moderation standpoint are doing the hosting they have the identity for their given platform and the distribution and so thus they have to do content moderation because then people are like well why are you hosting this video or why is that tweet still up where the reality is if you have a Marketplace of clients first of all there's no single Omni algorithm right like each client's going to have a different way that they're implementing that and B I think the average user does want some amount of content moderation but like when we have a Marketplace of of ways of solving it we call it spam filtering right it's like it's focused on low quality versus this like is this fundamentally something that should be posted or not I don't think most people are that worried about like the fact that there are some really kooky websites out there on the internet but if they don't have any distribution okay it doesn't really matter right yeah and that kind of just answers my next question which was like discoverability in the algorithm right the reason why we bankless post videos to YouTube is because the YouTube algorithm allows us to be discoverable but I'm going to go ahead and guess that the future web3 protocol version of this is the same answer that it was for spam prevention it was just like that is a vector upon which the clients compete upon and discoverability and whose algorithm is best who else whose algorithm is most enjoyable uh by people and makes them feel good is probably something that the client layer competes upon and it's also probably the way that forecaster also becomes like compliant with you know nation state regulations is that clients are going to have to like make sure that no illicit activity is happening on them but that doesn't that's no longer a responsibility of the protocol like the protocol is permissionless but clients still got to make sure that the activity inside of their specific client is like not going to trigger the ire of regulators if it's like you know illicit trades or you know all the bad things that happen on the internet internet that that is still something that uh the clients have to optimize for and work on that the protocol doesn't leaving the protocol still like peer and permissionless it's very similar to coinbase right like coinbase has to keep things clean on their end and they're they're subject to the laws in the countries they operate in but the blockchain is is a protocol and and you know what happens on there they have to take care of what interacts with them right and I think that that is the the right approach because it works really well for the web and email and I think we have the possibility if we can achieve what we want to achieve with forecaster for actually making the same for social and I do think on the on the algorithm side if you if you view that like let's say that there are five or ten major apps and they all have a slightly different algorithm instead of hacking the algorithm which is a lot of like what happens on these like monopolistic networks you actually get to a place where the best content across a variety of different algorithms is probably actually what succeeds right because it's hard to fake quality versus any one algorithm probably can be gamed but it's harder to fake 10 at a time then this could probably be this question I'm about to ask you could probably be an entire podcast so we don't want to do that but um it's one thing I just wanted to to cover before we we close here and we're getting ready to um so we've been having on on Bank lists this count conversation about identity and a quote from kind of bankless uh the bank list thesis is um phase one uh we take back our money phase two we take back our identity and um social certainly has a role in web 3 in in Phase uh two I think um how does this fit with the story of identity how does forecaster kind of feed into that we just had the folks from signing with ethereum on the podcast um people can look at that in archive bankless listeners uh in like maybe 45 seconds or so could you uh could you help us answer that question is does this play a role in a decentralized identity in that story I think it does um I think look you can today and vitalik's a great example of this you can have your own website and that can kind of be the primary pointer to your identity internet but the challenge is your website's going to have a very hard time unless you know very rare cases getting distribution and I think more people will be willing to actually start with a sovereign identity something that they really do control and and can kind of uh instantiate their Identity or display their identity in any way they want if they can associate it with distribution and so I think with forecaster or or other kind of decentralized identity approaches um if you basically can have that be the the Pivot Point assuming that you can then get distribution for whatever you're trying to say or achieve in the world I think that is the most promising path because um you know like distribution is the thing that people care about right it's the reason as many of the people who are interested into centralized social media and you know all the things that forecaster represents that they still continue to use Twitter is because they already have large audiences there and I can't fault them for it like that that that's actually a hard thing to do is build an audience and distribution and so if we can do our part in making it easier to have a decentralized way of connecting with a large group of people then I think you'll start to get Sovereign identity this is great um bankless listeners hope you enjoyed this conversation with Dan he's building a decentralized social network uh protocol called farcaster of course it's it's one of a couple that uh we will be a few I should say that we're exploring on Bank lists and uh we certainly wish you well on your Endeavor stand this has been a fun conversation thank you for introing us to decentralized social media and also to forecaster thanks for having me and I'm happy to offer bankless listeners a forecaster if that are you sure about that sir because uh you know you're about to get a lot of dude how about this uh we'll keep it we'll keep it to the uh the bankless nation Discord the first hundred people who send me a message with the word in it I'll I'll put a little filter in my uh my Twitter DM inbox I'll know they have listened to the end of the podcast Dan is it okay if we uh beep that word out and only have that go out on the premium feed oh there you go that's that's the benefit of the premium subscription so we we've just beeped the word out so if you want to unlock that beep uh then uh go become a bankless premium member and uh we'll save Dan's DM so he doesn't hear from too many the full Bank list Community just that's that's real proof of work I guess that's probably not the right corner sake there it is that's awesome well uh we appreciate it Dan this has been a lot of fun thanks so much thanks for having me risks and disclaimers guys gotta end with this of course uh crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey
