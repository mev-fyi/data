[Music] hello everyone welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today's weekly recap episode is a little different than our usual episode because we are launching a new segment here on overpriced jpegs it won't be every week at least to start but it'll be frequently and that is our new segment a moment of zeneca so this is as some of you may know as some of you may have be able to predict based on that name we are doing a recurring segment with xenica 33 where he gives market updates talks about what's happening from a macro perspective in nfts looks at specific projects that are doing well are doing poorly really walks us through the last couple of weeks in nft land when we talk so in my initial conception of this this would be a segment that would go for 10 minutes and then i would proceed with my usually scheduled programming which is to talk through what i'm seeing in the nft space for the week give you the update on what's happening but i should have known better because i love talking to zenika and as it so happens as we started talking we ended up covering pretty much everything i planned to talk about on this recap episode we covered by just chatting together which honestly is a is a more fun way to go for me than sitting alone here with my microphone so i think this entire episode this week is just one big segment of a moment of zenika so with that all said we're gonna have a word from our sponsor and then we're gonna kick off our brand new segment a moment of zenika with seneca 33. axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute

everybody who listens to the show knows how much i love your wisdom in this space so i couldn't be more thrilled to have you on here i'm excited to be here planned to be on a more recurring basis yeah it's i mean i listen to the show it's i'm a fan of it so to be on it it's it's great i love it i love it too well let's dive right in so most of us know nfts are up it's been a good couple years but yeah nfc nfts go boom why is it gonna last talk us through how we should be thinking about this call it a ball run yeah i mean yeah i think it's safe to call it a ball run i think i mean the first few days whenever prices go up i'm always reluctant to say it's a bull run because it could just be some short-term spike but it's been pretty much two weeks now so we're recording this on the 13th january basically it was as soon as the new year new year hit it just went crazy i think part of it was probably because people were done like tax loss tax loss harvesting that was just a thing that we saw a lot in the nft space towards the end of last year which it happened a lot more than i was anticipating like a lot of people were like you know realizing huge losses and and a lot of prices were tanking and there was not a lot of people wanting to buy things and then yeah so at the beginning of the bull market i was like that's probably the number one catalyst and obviously gas wasn't too crazy which always helps and eth has sort of been sitting around the same price which also helps i think if eath is pumping generally nfts are not if eath is tanking also generally nfts don't pump they wait for each to settle and then they tank so when ether sort of you know trending sideways that's when we've historically largely seen nfcs go crazy and that's sort of what we saw like a lot of the the price of ether was very stagnant for most of december and first little bit of january obviously it crashed a lot since then but um i think those were the three main catalysts that i was initially aware of like stable eath low-ish gas and tax loss harvesting season over but sort of i then became aware of like a new sort of phenomenon a few days later which is it seems like asia like the asian market has really turned up and entered the nft space in a way that we perhaps haven't really seen before and obviously you know it's an enormous market tons of people tons of money so with that flowing into the nft space it is just an extra catalyst and i think the most obvious example of that is the fan to bear project yeah i haven't been super tracking this so tell me i know it like surpassed crypto punks i think in terms of trade volume but i don't know give me the give me the fanta bears story yeah so it's like a joint collection by two i'm gonna show my ignorance i don't know if they're like music stars or or music movie stars or whatever but it's a jay chow and izek like just two huge stars in asia and you know the collection i think pretty much largely went under the radar for the majority of people sort of in the west like it just sort of came up out of nowhere seemingly and uh the floor kind of quickly rocketed to like point five eth and then just over the course of like four days it went like point five to two two to four and a half four and a half to seven and it was just like this monumental beast and i heard people referring it to us like the border yacht club for asia and things like that and and it's still today sitting at the number one top volume on open c over the last week which is you know it's more than the board apes it's more than doodles doodles have been going crazy and this is is more than that and the floor prices come back down a bit it's like four-ish each now but you know that's still incredible for a project that largely came out of nowhere and yeah i think that got a lot of people excited the market excited and then a lot of that money has also flowed elsewhere and it's just gent a lot of things bullish in energy space yeah uh have you bought a fanta bear are you buying phantom bears i am not i well yeah so i haven't bought any i again was not really aware of them but they they basically sent me one for free there's a perks of being an influencer so oh wow get enough followers yeah at around when they were like 0.5 eth someone just reached out to me and said hey the phantom bears team would like to send you one no strings attached and i pretty much never heard of them at that point but like i won't i usually don't turn down just free nfts no strings attached i'm not going to promote it but if you want to say that 95 98 of the time that they they're worthless they don't do anything but i guess this is the one or two percent time where it's i mean i still have it i haven't sold it or anything i feel weird about selling things that get sent for free but when i hit when i hit at seven eighth i was definitely tempted i'm starting to get this a little bit too and a quick side note like does it do you ever feel bad not mentioning a project that sends you something for free no not anymore like well i i never really did because i always made like a pretty strong point about not doing it and it's just i get so many scent these days it's just like yeah yeah it's i agree it's definitely a principled point for me but there are again i just in the last couple days like i've had a couple things said to me and i'm like oh gosh like thank you and you know yeah yeah i mean i know and i'm like yeah yeah i'm always grateful and like i'll if they like what happens a lot is the project will make like an honorary nft and then send it to a bunch of people and i'll just like say thank you and publicly and whatever if i really like the project then i'll um you know shout them out a bit more but it's based on me liking the project and not because they send something for free right yeah i have my own anecdote with the the asian market which is and i talked about it on the show i helped work on the the meebitz dao i i have worked on evidencedown and we had launched a token a few months ago called mbbt which was a you know share in a pool of me bits and it would you know the idea is that it's like proxy ownership of those mee bits you can go and use those knee bits in the metaverse or as your profile picture whatever you want to do it's supposed to not just be a fraction of that you're actually supposed to to kind of share ownership over over me bits um and so we had these mbbt tokens and there was a liquidity pool set up and as a promotion we had run we had said hey if you buy a general membership token into the mevitz tao you get i think it was like 10 mbbt somehow this caught the attention of the asian market and i think specifically in mainland china and we were suddenly flooded i mean mbbt we it had launched at like 20 or maybe i think it was less than that and and it you know immediately went to like 75 and it was specifically people from the chinese market and you know now we have all these chinese moderators in the discord because a lot of the discord is is this and they specifically they've been writing sort of letters of like hey we want clarity on this and they've been these kind of really well thought out letters that they've given to sort of even style leadership and one said specifically that noted that you know the chinese market is starting to get into nfts and that mbbt was this really good bridging ground for them because they're more used to currencies and tokens than like the erc20s and mbbt sort of was like a token they became drawn to and then because of that got really into knee bits and now they love the look of the medics and so i guess i should have seen that as a as a harbinger of what was to come a couple years ago when it started happening but you don't you don't know yeah couldn't have anticipated a microcosm of something that's going to happen exactly yeah um but it's it's clearly going on and uh i think it's exciting obviously for the very much so yeah community as a whole yeah it's yeah it's great you have done an awesome thing historically which are the daily stats sheets i think you haven't been posting those publicly as much as of late but i was wondering if i was hoping you could give us a rundown projects worth highlighting projects that are stumbling surprisingly a la what you've done historically with your stats sheets tell us what you're watching yeah so i mean it's been it's been a crazy couple of weeks everything has basically gone up i think profile picture projects specifically like cube pfp projects have really exploded so i think beginning with doodles they sort of ran up from the three to four eth range to like 12 now in the course of maybe two weeks which is insane and then a lot of people were like hey why are doodles so appealing and then it was like the cute the universally appealing aspect the the friendly colorfulness and then things like alien friends really really took off i think they hit like four eighth floor at one point they've come down quite a bit to like 2.8 now cool man's universe is another one that has that again that cutesy vibe and so we're seeing i think a lot of these newer projects sort of that have been sitting in the maybe like the 0.5 to 203 eth range really take off this bull run obviously like bought apes and mutants and cool cats have done well but it's very difficult for those projects to like 3x 5x 10x like once once you hit a floor of 10th 15th 50th 70th you're just not going to get those gains anymore there's not that much capital and so i think people are now looking to the sort of the newer projects which are decently well established have a lot going for them to just find the next body of your club the next cool cats and now the next doodles and so that's why we're seeing it with these probably the biggest breakout in the more recent days is the world of women they went from so i i minced it a bunch i've been selling them over time um to luck to just get profits and then about i think a week ago i listed a bunch of like 2.7 2.8 because you know it was pretty high price i wasn't sure that the market could sustain high prices sort of across the board it wasn't specific to all the women i still think it's a great project i still have some but um yeah i was like you know prices have gone up everywhere i'm going to take some profits and then within three or four days after that they're up to like 18th now 780 huge celebrities getting on board huge twitter influencers are getting on board it's it's really just captured the the zeitgeist i think and it's not just world of women i think we saw some a phenomenon last night which we've seen a few times where like women projects like projects by women or like focusing in the artwork that are like largely women-centric so world of women boss beauties crypto chicks crypto covens uh encrypters that they've like done very well specifically last 24 hours i guess but over the last week do you think that was led by the world of women's spike and the news so guy oh siri who wraps one of the boys is repping world of women now and and so the trickle-down effect of women was these other women projects or definitely some element of that yeah i think because obviously at seven or eight it's unaffordable for 99.9 of people but when you you have other entry points at much lower price points um if people are looking for you know a project that's aimed towards women or like with more inclusivity compared to like more the male dominated centric projects where all the traits are male yeah then they look for all these other options and it's probably boosted them a bit but many of them are doing very well um boss beauties have their own thing like they have a partnership with freaking marvel and they've been teasing that so yeah it's just been honestly it's been a great time for most projects that there hasn't really been too much that's bled i would say maybe generative art has not been captured in the this bull run it's very much focused on like profile picture projects gaming projects metaverse land that those kind of things and um yeah art hasn't really popped off but we sort of see cycles in the nfc space you know general of art will have its moment one-on-one art metaverse land gaming peripheral pictures and then you know back and forth and it just keeps looping around and attention just shifts from one place to another and i'm sure that uh art will have another day in the sun yeah i have so many reactions to this one the first thought i was having as you were talking about cutesy projects doing well is if that might also be connected to the to the asian market really entering nfts i think of them as like the land of hello kitty yeah i think of that as being a culture that can that is at times drawn to sort of the cutesy who knows speculation i'm sure you don't have a definitive advantage on that world of women is such a it's just been like a painful week for me not actually because i know my projects have been doing well as well but it's that feeling of like oh but i could be doing better right yeah world of women i sat in this exact seat of when world of war was 0.1 i was like uh i don't know like i i still and i've talked about this on the show it's funny given that i do this show but like i have a hard time pulling trigger on projects because i'm i hate losing money yeah and it is so speculative and i am somebody who tends to be very bullish on eath sort of like trade eat for a project is like i'm like oh you know i wasn't somebody who got in to you know in january where i couldn't help but become a millionaire or whatever and so so yeah i pass on world of women and now of course i'm like kicking myself and then and then i and that was a gary vee had been big pushing world of women kind of in the early days and then he was big you know talking about creatures and then i did end up getting into creatures i i chose to get into creatures instead of buying a mutant mutants were like four yeah and now i'm like i mean again i'm still long-term bullish on yeah yeah i just feel like it's been uh it's so hard one hit after another in terms of like missed profits yeah uh i also saw the boss beauty the day before it started pumping it up like sort of like what you did with world of women so i did a profit yeah yeah yeah like a phrase that's been bouncing around my head a lot lately is like infinite regret there's just infinite regret in this space yeah yes yeah i know and i that's something i so appreciate your about your content is you talk about that and like you you'd put it in your discord like if you're making money if you're losing money if you feel like you should be making more money like take a deep breath because that was where i was that feeling of like sometimes in these bull runs you're like i should be making more money exactly like instead of just being grateful that i'm making money at all our brains are so crazy it's just insane it is it is so you talk about newer projects are are actually starting to do well and and obviously it's hard for a project that's sitting at 10 20 30 to 3x or or whatever it is and i heard somebody say this i don't get credit for this point but in terms of looking ahead at like the coinbase marketplace or this expectation that i think some in the community have that we're going to have new entrants into the nft space and that that's going to be really good for nfts you know obviously that that probably will be best for newer projects because it's unlikely that you're going to see if a ton of new entrants come in they're probably not going to be dropping 100 000 you know maybe even 20 30 40 000 dollars on these projects some people are going to be super rich and maybe do that um i think you see on the celebrity side people obviously come in and it's usually aboard ape but when you're talking about like everyday people entering the nft space yeah you're much more likely to buy into projects that are half an eighth and eighth or more at those yeah those more affordable ranges yeah that's what we might expect to pump you know over the course this year as you see if we see a bunch of new people coming into the space what do you think of that yeah i think that's really interesting i was actually thinking and talking about the coinbase marketplace like just before we jumped on this call it will be really interesting to see what happens because they basically they're whitelisting the projects that are approved to be listed there basically i think because they're publicly traded they don't want to be open like open c or any other marketplace so i think the collections that are listed are probably just going to do well like very well there's just so much money there will be people that are willing to pay 50k 100k that maybe don't want to figure out metamask and open c and all of that but if they can just click a button and say hey you know jimmy fallon has an ape you know etc eminem has an ape okay i'm a wealthy entrepreneur i have millions of dollars in my coinbase account i want some nft exposure let me just buy an eight cool done some of that will happen and i think that money will trickle down into other parts of the ecosystem but you will also get i guess i'm really interested to know what how they'll treat new mints like new projects because that's where like sort of the new retail investors are going to be most attracted to a because the price is cheaper and the upside is just more is greater but also just the fun aspect like people enjoy minting because you get see your rarity and the reveal and you don't get that if it's just secondary market activity i haven't heard anything about whether they'll be launching projects from the coinbase coinbase marketplace or they'll only have existing projects and like if a project mints out will it just immediately be able to be listed on coinbase or they'll have to go through an application process and take weeks because like a lot of the activity we see with hyped projects is they mint out and then everyone just rushes to openc or now looks rare just to trade and snipe and just that's where all the activity happens if that can't happen on coinbase it's it's really going to be a hindrance i think for for those new market participants yeah it seems like they're still sorting a lot of that out i i talked to a project founder whose project is is listed on coinbase and i was asking how what that process was and they were like it was weird like sort of you know it was like i emailed somebody and then there was back and forth like there isn't i was expecting there would be like hey you go to this link yeah yeah a better on-boarding process but it it seemed kind of a lot more chaotic yeah so i feel like it hasn't even been sorted out in terms of how to get your project listed it probably explains the delay i do but yeah yeah yeah in terms of the you know one of those so broadly you know and down the line how projects get listed it feels like they're not even at the first phase of that process like fully kind of sorted out you mentioned looks rare any any thoughts on looks are you staking what's your yes i mean full disclosure i was a strategic investor so i have tokens vested for six months that are earning trading rewards and my aside from that from the airdrop uh i've staked everything yeah i suspected that when you came on to do the predictions episode you hinted that there were some new marketplaces that you thought would be even better than coinbase in terms of their capacity to challenge open season yeah i wonder yeah yeah i'm excited for it because obviously competition is good openc has issues understandably it's you know an enormous platform has had to deal with scaling issues and growing pains but clearly the market was like looking for an alternative and if anything hopefully it forces openc to just be better and improve and yeah so i'm um i mean looks rare has it's not the best marketplace yet it has ui issues it's you know it has some bugs there's features missing there are features that are added like the the collection bids that's really cool i love that there's the whole wash trading thing going on at the moment which you know people are saying yeah arguing whether it's a good thing or not i think that the team has sort of said it'll sort itself out which i i think it will explain that i haven't been tracking that yeah so i i don't know a hundred percent of the details i haven't really probably researched it but basically each day the the trading fee so they take two percent on every trade that gets in that goes into a pool which is then redistributed to the participants who have staked or traded or something and um what people realized was that if they just execute huge trades so like literally i saw like a 14 000 eth trade for a me bit the other day because there's zero percent royalties on on the actual rebit so you're seeing these collections that have zero percent creative royalties so they're saying okay we'll pay the two percent but our account will you know lodge this enormous amount of activity so that we'll get a higher share of the rewards pool and yeah the way it's sort of working out is that currently the the people that are doing the wash trading are making a bit of money but more and more people are now like we're only like three days in but more people are trying to do it as well and they're sort of competing with one another and it'll sort of reach an equilibrium state where it's no longer profitable for them to do it and especially as regular marketplace activity increases as well the wash trading will be a smaller percentage so it's just an interesting economic thing happening and like free market thing happening where we're like realizing yeah in real time what's what's going on i think the team has handled it what handled it well they've addressed it they've like even before they launched i think they had like a thing on their website saying what if this was trading and they explained how it'll sort itself out or that they'll look at it yeah so i mean i'm i'm again generally bullish on on looks rare i think it'll carve out at the very least a niche um if for nothing else then like the zero percent fee on on private sales like that that's something that a lot of people hate with open c like if you want to sell something privately why are we paying open c two and a half percent for and that's why people go to things like sudo swap or nft trader and other sites um if if looks rare can just be like a cleaner better ui for that that'll be great but i think i think it'll capture some non-insignificant amount of market share over the the medium to long term hopefully yeah it it to your point about it driving openc to be better and competition which is good i mean you know i was sort of looking at something talking about the similarities between this and the the uniswap sushi moment in time and you know learning a little bit about a vampire attack yeah i think is what this is called pretty much directly going for uh you know open yeah air drop user base by directly air dropping open c users tokens for folks who don't know sushi swap when they launched to compete with uni swap they basically said we'll give sushi tokens to anybody who staked their uniswap lp tokens in sushi swap so again very directly targeting that one monopolistic somewhat competitor and and i you know i'm not on the d5 side but i use unispot and sushi swap a little bit and again it's great if you have somebody who's challenging you to be better obviously both platforms are still around you swap and sushi swap and in theory they just they make each other better so i think that's a good take i agree there's some ui stuff like i'm like buy now and sort by ascending which is like just my yes my daily life is one interesting note about the sushi swap uni swap thing is sushi shop literally just like forked the contracts they're like we just copy paste yeah because they can do that but with the marketplace obviously they don't want to just copy open c because there's a lot of things that they want to fix i think with sushi swap they had like issues with the management of the way it was running or they had better ideas and they're like hey we can do what you do with better lower fees or something with luxury they just built it from the ground up but yeah again takes time to to figure out the kinks and stuff hopefully they do yeah everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse unstoppable domains is the number one

you can get your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com i want to close with this which is you and i were chatting a little bit yesterday and i know you and i both are book games token holders right gary vee has done this book games nft project but you said you haven't really been tracking it you don't really know what's going on with it i have been the other end of the spectrum which is like borderline addicted to it you're playing the games trying to wean myself off of yeah i'm i don't know if i'm playing the right version of vacation what is the game please tell me okay game uh game does feel like maybe the the wrong term it's no like it's no wolf game you know that's not like that that kind of a thing but there there is a component i suppose it feels like a game and then i'm addicted to it okay i'm gonna give a little background context for people who maybe know nothing about this uh the short of it is gary vaynerchuk back in the fall or summer something around then announced that he had a new book coming out and that if you pre-ordered 12 copies of his book you would be entitled to an nft that he would be launching what turned out to be this month in january and there was no limit to how many you could buy for every 12 books you bought you would get an nft and he was hyping it up in his very gary vaynerchuk way you know like yeah you're not buying enough you know he's like on a youtube stream like telling everybody yeah they need to be buying more of these things and like calling out specific individuals that he's like i know you've got money buy more right and obviously even the success of v friends i think there was a lot of you know okay done you know like you say bye you say jump all jump gary uh i i certainly you know sort of one of those people i've done very well and be friends so i feel very grateful to gary for that so but and so i think he ended up selling like a million and a half copies of his book so like obama territory in terms of how many copies of a book uh have been sold uh but then of course i think you would fear a little bit on the the buyer's side of oh my gosh there's gonna be 125 000 tokens released how are you going to make 125 000 tokens valuable gary had this sort of good one-liner about you know supply is only a problem if demand's a problem you know as long as i can generate enough demand yeah then supply doesn't matter yeah but again sort of a lot of open questions about how this is going to be handled you spent the last couple months teasing this idea of book games and now we finally have some insight into what this is so basically these 125 000 tokens function to some extent like a currency in this marketplace he's set up on the v friends website you can exchange you can burn book tokens in exchange for other things that exist on this marketplace right now it's a lot of nfts trading cards you know he's got a world of women for example that you could you can buy world of women nfts using by burning your book tokens or creature nfts or curios or rap strikers etc etc um same with trading cards he also is selling some v con 2022 tickets uh for you can you know buy a ticket by burning your book tokens he's teased again in his gary vaynerchuk way like down the line it'll be things because he keeps saying book games are played forever so this is intended to be a very long-term thing he's teased you know there will be and courtside tickets at nba games like all sorts of different wild experiences that will be exchangeable tradable for burning there is this other component to it which is he's said book games tokens are the only way you'll be able to get on to like a pre-mint list for v friends series 2 which he says is probably coming out in april or may sometime in the spring of this year and so book game tokens don't guarantee you'll get onto the premium list but it but having them is the only way to get on so this is something you know floor price right now for these book game tokens are sitting around 1.6 i think which 0.16 yeah level stuff yeah yeah that would be wild there have been many that have there's some of the super rare ones have been going for i mean the highest sale i saw was 63 each wow and so somebody somebody paid like 330 bucks for 12 books and just sold something for 63 each this space is amazing that's space is amazing i was not lucky enough to get any like yeah particularly rare ones but so they're sitting around point one six eight still pretty good given that i again you probably including tax whatever paid a little north of 300 bucks for these so the like you know the kind of least rare ones are sitting at that level but so that'll be the only way in order to get into this this pre-mint list for for v friend series two and then there's the piece that i feel like is what has just ensnared me and why i'm addicted which is there's a somewhat complex rarity scheme to these but it's not it's it's simple to learn it's just there's kind of a lot so each of these nfts is sort of like a painting in that it has a frame a mat and then an image and each of those three components have different rarities and so it creates a whole bunch of different reality combinations and you buy and sell these on tokentrove which is an immutablex marketplace also a very imperfect marketplace yeah it's just like glitches and lags and sometimes i just like can't update prices to my things but it has no gas fees and this has been the thing that has ensnared me as somebody who's been like deep in this and and has a pretty like it's started to develop a good feel for the rarities like on site because i kind of know them well now i feel like and some still to be seen a little bit i guess on this like i feel like i've i have i can kind of spot an underpriced world kind of quickly and so i become very addicted to snagging what i see as underpriced book games tokens and i've done some immediate flipping some i think i'll be able to flip you know if if prices go up a little bit on this which i think they will and because there's no gas yeah this is like a frictionless experience there's nothing keeping me from doing doing this and uh i'll probably come back to you in like three months and be like yeah i have been i have been whatever you know i've i've been bankrupted by book games or you'll be just a book game mogul and you'll just or yeah or it'll be obvious i mean you know my trouble is again because i'm kind of a cheapskate so like the biggest gains gains in this space are always made by buying the the kind of higher end things but i never want to put like three seven eight like i never want to put that much down i'm the same yeah oh you know and so uh so that i never end up you know when that 70 thing goes to 100 either but yeah i haven't had that but anyway that's the book games that's what's going on with it again not not really more of like an exchange more yeah not a game but i am finding a game component you're finding your own rarity schema yeah i've made my own game out of out of this experience that's really cool i had no idea about the marketplace and how you could you know there's a currency like yeah i mean just i have some books as well but i haven't really done anything with them yeah i think it's very confusing for someone on the outside who doesn't even if like someone who has books to understand and like figure it out it takes a little while and yeah but it sounds it's not absolutely it yeah yeah yeah i give gary a lot of credit i think he's doing a lot of innovative he's trying a lot of innovative things in this space yeah it's absolutely complicated like and god bless his team who like puts out a ton of information about this like they do what they can to educate people and get like they but at the end of the day this space is so crowded like it's confusing it's so confusing the friends website marketplace to token trophy you have to set up an immutable x wallet so difficult but yeah honestly like the information and like education he tries to spread is just since day one like onboarding people to buy the v friends it's just been i think his impact on the space is most people don't appreciate it and it's it's enormous yeah in a positive way he's a relentless person like you know god do i wish i had a fraction of his energy it's insane he's just 24 7 on i remember someone i heard from a few people that during the i think it was the v friends launch or something they dm'd him on twitter and he just replied and it's like he's launching this thing he's got millions of followers and he's just replying around and like support requests and stuff it's like insane yeah well and and i think the last thing i'll say on it is that i do tend to be like a bet on the team kind of a person but they're very smart people who won't end up being able to make a lasting nft project and gary is somebody i believe in because i do think he has such a track record and he is so vocal and out there visibly in a way that makes you at least feel like you get a sense of him yeah you know i feel like i kind of know him i do trust his ability to understand what needs to be done here to make a really lasting nft project so that's the other reason i feel like i'm i'm willing to go a little crazier than i usually do you know trading is i do think that in the long term he'll he'll create more value for these and he's been explicit saying the floor price is too low yeah and i i trust him yeah he says that because he's he's tended to be right on v friends when he said that and he actually predict he said when it launched he thought the floor price would probably be between like 400 and 700 dollars he nailed that yeah and then what it was that he was like but i think it'll yeah it will go higher when i announce v series two or this and that so yeah i don't know here we are collusion gary bullish on gary for sure and you bought a fly fish club i did i bought three actually so much for the same reasons um betting on people and betting on gary i think he is obviously incredibly smart and hard working he he knows business he knows marketing he knows all of this stuff and he knows nfcs also his reputation matters and to him like to like he he he's basically just not gonna let these fail he's gonna do everything in his power to make anyone that sort of took a leap of faith who bet on him who invested in him and his ideas he wants to make everyone money and he wants to make everyone successful and he wants to grow the space as well yeah so with the fly fish club i'm a huge fruity and i think the idea is really interesting merging restaurants with membership tokenizations for reservation i don't actually fully understand how it works yet like it was sort of just it popped up it was on my right i was like this is something i definitely want to be part of yeah so i bought they have two different membership tiers like the fly fish tier and then the omakase tier which is like whatever the higher one and so my plan was to buy to mint whatever i could because it was like a gas war and difficult and then flip them and then i figured cause the restaurant's not gonna be built for like a year and a half or something people are going to lose interest they're going to want liquidity elsewhere prices will tank bear market will hit and then i'll buy them again what ended up happening was i'm into two of the fly fish ones i didn't get any of the omakasi ones i was feeling the fomo as i saw them like getting picked up on secondary and like the supply is lows the numberless for sale was reducing i was like all right i gotta get one of those i ended up just buying one i'm holding all three now so i'm just my plan when are i price i guess if price is really rocket i will sell one or two of the originals but because again i'm a foodie i'm a huge fan of garyvee i want to keep the omakase one just for personal use yeah if a bear market hits and they go down i will buy one because i i was looking at him again i can't i couldn't even bring myself to pay the two and a half eighth in one shot i just i'm like i'm just not rich enough to give up that much ethan in one shot at this point um but i am based in new york city and would love to like i i had fomo looking at it while i was not bothered which is like god i want to go and uh so if if prices fall if if people do forget about it and that plays out i will probably buy into one oh i was just gonna say on the reputation front i think you nailed exactly why i believe in gary too is i think he is somebody for whom his reputation honestly matters to him more than money yeah and i feel like that's something i see in you i feel it myself like that's true for me as a person where it's like i'd rather and i think that's kind of a real key distinction between influencers i trust and i think influencers who end up you know there's been kind of scandals in the market those last couple weeks that i think are an indication of of people or project owners or people who kind of cared more about the short-term financial win than building their long-term reputation and i think looking for that and spotting that is like yeah one of the key things when you're figuring out who to trust yeah here to trust and people and projects to invest in uh yeah it all comes down to people i think at the end of the day everything in in this space in life it's look at people that's how you make the best decisions i think talk talk to people as well you know beautiful all right a beautiful way to close this talk to people talk to people it's all about people yeah well thank you so much we are doing this regularly so you will be
