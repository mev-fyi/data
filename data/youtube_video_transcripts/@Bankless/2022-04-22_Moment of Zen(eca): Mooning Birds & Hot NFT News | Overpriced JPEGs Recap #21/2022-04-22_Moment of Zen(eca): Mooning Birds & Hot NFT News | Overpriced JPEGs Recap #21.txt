tomorrow so like i'm just throwing up my hands in the air being like i'm i'm that's it i did my best up until this time now i want to come back it's going to be a whole new world in a few weeks uh i totally relate you and i we're joking so and we should actually give this caveat as we record this this episode will be coming out friday the 22nd however we are recording this on tuesday april 19th so usually we record these thursday mornings and they come out friday morning so it's like a 24-hour lag this is like more like a 72-hour lag and in this space that means anything could happen so we apologize in advance if by the time you hear this some of what we discuss is outdated or doesn't include the latest information uh but we are zenica is going away i'm going to the amazon we're actually going to talk about that a little bit i'm going with an nft project um so we are doing what we can making do with what we can okay um do we want to do like we'd love to hear the macro updates from your perspective and i think we very quickly get ourselves into moon birds and and the aftermath of that sale but any kind of macro updates you want to touch on or what's happening big picture i mean the macro update is moon birds it's yeah like it's done it did more volume in i think like 48 hours than the next 25 projects did over the previous seven days it's just ludicrous it's done more volume lifetime than cyber cons it's done more volume lifetime than i'm actually going to pull it up right now and see what other project i think world of women it's like more like like it's so crazy it it's done more volume than cryptos and parallel loot it's coming up on wearable um it's just so crazy like it's done more lifetime value in in in 48 hours than wearable the marketplace period wearable on openc i think so it's like it's it's not quite that same but still that's still crazy um it's like getting close to doodles and cool cats it's it's it's been crazy it is the macro update it's it's this all anyone can talk about for this week has basically been moon birds um what is your takeaway what should we what are we learning about the market or the state of the market today by the fact that moon birds has done what it's done i think it's a shift um it's it's definitely a a turning point to some extent like we'll look back upon this and be like almost pre-moon birds and post moon birds or because we have never seen a project it's really unprecedented the level of success it's had um even mutants when they were dropped like with the backing of boarded your club and all that they did less volume than this so i think it's it's a sign that the market is maturing in terms of the amount of money that is flowing around and can flow around and i think that we saw a lot of like outside funding come in for moonbird specifically like whether it's vc money or dows that maybe hadn't been very heavily involved in nfts or maybe they were intergenerative art nfts and this was the first pfp project that they really went heavy into uh and i think a lot of that is it's i mean most of it isn't just credit to kevin rose who's got this massive uh network following audience podcast where he reaches a very diverse group of people including lots of people who might not be have been interested in nfts until they saw he was doing a project and now betting on him so um yeah unprecedented i also think we're in this place in the market right now and tell me if you agree with this where there's almost a higher level of risk aversion than we've seen previously i think scams whether it's pixel mods or whatever you want to point to i think there's just been people who've lost money who people don't want to get into riskier projects and this is like the safest project that has emerged in a long long time because people feel like they know kevin rose because he obviously has an incredibly proven track record in business period but is also not just a business success as somebody who spent the last year deep diving in this space publicly um and forming that relationship it just was like this has felt safe and i think people are really flocking to projects that influencers that they trust are endorsing because i just think everyone's nervous there's been enough scams enough people have lost money yeah and there's just too many projects now like just way too many for people to even really good legitimate projects are just it's turning out they're not making it or like their floor prices are crumbling and maybe they'll turn it around but maybe they won't and people are a little bit panicked and it's sort of like i think when we did the last couple of macro updates it was like it's blue chip season and that's right i think this is just an extension of that where it's it's it's too early to call moon birds of blue chip it's been out for less than a week but it's certainly got a lot of the qualities that the blue chips have and i think that to your point a lot of people felt that this is a really safe bet safe place to and but i thought that i was uh i i don't know if i said it publicly or in my discord or something but i was like i have never been more bullish on a project pre-launch than moon birds um and it still exceeded my expectations like i i was thinking to begin with maybe the floor settled around seven eight um then like closer to launch i was getting more bullish i was like my most bull case was like a 12th floor yeah and you know we're sitting at 20 basically now i i had said i was like if it hit six or even six and a half i'll buy one which of course it didn't do unsurprisingly yeah it was close i think the lowest it got was around seven and a half i was eyeing it i was tracking it so close on secondary that day because i didn't get on the allow list um and you know of course in hindsight i should have just bought it seven and a half but it's too much money for me to put down all at once i can't i can't do that there's always the risk kevin rose was hit by a car and it went to zero right i can't play with what i can't afford to lose kind of a thing and yeah you know that much money on one project is too much for me there's so much yeah there's a lot of risk um i think it's still really early yeah i think there are uh i think this also presented an opportunity for for um i think this presented other buying opportunities because so much energy and liquidity was sucked up by moon birds that liquidity came from somewhere some of it you suggested as is new money but it also came from other projects so other projects that are solid that were dropping or i've just been sort of neglected because of this and and so when i was nursing my wounds over not being on the the uh moon bird the loud list that was really what the the bright side and the silver linings i tried to find was like you know i publicly talked about i bought a dead fellow which is a project i've wanted to get into for quite a while that sort of been falling and kind of languishing um just because they hadn't had new news lately and this this you know market operates only on needing like immediate news and i was like okay great you know what they're they're nothing's changed about these fundamentals but it's dropped a bit and it's it's you know cheaper than my last look i i have some extra eat because i didn't get to spend it on moon birds like why don't i go go in on that um and then it popped today on the news that dead fellas is signed with uta uta yeah like an hour like half an hour ago it's just it's still pumping now floors are like 2.2 2.3 um it was at 1.7 before this news and like you said it's just like this market moves on news um yeah i saw it and i i saw your tweet the other day and i was like i i have no dead fellas i was like this is a hole in my portfolio i need some i looked at the sec at the market i was like you know i'm just gonna wait wait a bit like i feel like it's probably gonna keep dropping until some news happens and i was just fortunately online as this dropped someone messaged in a discord and i saw it i was like all right i'm just buying so i got a couple you perfectly timed the market i know well you know i got lucky yeah yeah yeah i uh i bought it like 1.8 and then saw it dropped a little bit but you know it yeah i was i was going to say like that doesn't bother me which is true because i i'm a long-term deadfall holder the only reason it bugged me and this will this will get into it a topic i think we'll talk about in a second which is awkwatars which i i spoke a lot about last week on the pod i'm so jazzed about this project i ended up not buying a mint pass even though i was advocating on the podcast for people to buy one at 1.7 eth and then they of course pumped to like three and a half eth so have i was doing that second guessing myself of like oh is this the right time to buy a dead fella should i bought my haku tour um but uh but in general very happy to have my fella and you know i relatively timed it well too pretty shortly before this news obviously not knowing at all that this was coming um okay other takeaways you you mentioned uh world of women and the fact that moon birds has done more volume now already than like world of women lifetime or whatever and i've been seeing people talk about this i don't know if you've seen this like the world of women floor is i think six down to like six point something east it's really dropped um and some people are kind of making the gender point about it like female project i i i don't know um but i'm curious if you have thoughts on this world of women undervalued uh what do you think on that i don't know uh it's certainly dropped a bunch since the galaxy drop um when it was sort of maybe that was like peak hype and peak you know attention and stuff and that's natural like this space moves on hype cycles and it's an attention economy so when people naturally move from this to the next hot thing they were like where do we get liquidity from maybe for the moon birds raffle world of women is going to be one of those places but it was sort of like dropping a little bit before that even um i don't have a strong um view on world of women i haven't been like following it too closely i i mean i'll just say that i never i don't know i i think that there are projects that are doing more that have a lower floor price i guess um consider world of women blue chip no not personally not my i think it hits a lot of those right metrics uh and probably most people would um and i think in the past i might have almost said that they were blue chip or that they were almost blue chip and i think they're still in that almost blue chip category um and it's interesting the definition of blue chip is sort of evolving a bit over time um like cool cats i would have always said was like for a long time i was like that's a blue chip nfp project now it's like they've had some like sketchy few months um and then we've had new projects arise and just azuki now i think is a blue chip moon birds is almost a blue chip in my mind already um yeah i think i think here's a trading strategy to take is like these projects that were blue that you would have said at one point or blue chip that you think have fallen off blue chip status i almost think are are potentially the best buying opportunities right now because to the point you made last week of um or a couple weeks ago like number one rule of nfts is never sell your nfts like pudgy penguins has come back if pudgy penguins can come back god damn can cool cats come back from just like some delayed dev work you know and i actually do think that um that's when you can find discounts on some of these products like if you've ever once had blue chip status it means you have or you know you could have been considered having status you have a community of people really vested in your success and so they're gonna be pumps again you know yeah i think you're absolutely right uh yeah now as a long-term hold i don't know but i i would be very surprised if cool cats or world of women didn't go up from here at some point like it just feels like a no-brainer opportunity to to at some point sell out higher than they currently are listed yeah i know i fully agree the the issue always is opportunity costs and juggling liquidity because it's like if you buy a world of women or cool cats maybe you're not buying um you can put them together by doodles or an acotar which we're going to get into and you're going to tell me about because i've been hearing about it more and more i still have very little idea of what it is oh i'm so pumped for this i feel bad i apologize to anybody who heard me rant about aquitars last week and now is going to listen to it again but there'll be some new new information to this time or not because we've had some updates even since last week other thing i wanted to get that i i know not as much about that i want to get your thoughts on if you have them is this potential hugo labs land drop announcement you have some projects pumping on that news uh wanna tell us what's going on there yeah so in the the league deck that almost everyone has seen uh yuga spoke about how they want to drop this meta rpg and they're gonna drop land um i think 200 000 plots in two different trenches 100k first and then 100k later um they were saying 30k will be dropped or click free claim for apes and mutants and then the 70k will be a public sale i've heard different rumors lately whereas like maybe apes will get two and mutants will get one so it'll be like 40k um but who who really knows it's yeah but that they said april like they're like that's happening in april so a lot of people are like well it's april it's getting closer to the end of april it's gonna come out it's like um the one-year anniversary for board apes are coming up it's 4 20 tomorrow like that's a date that people love to meet about this space so yeah there's a lot of speculation um there's there was part of that leaked deck i think said that mutants would get an extra special tile like a slime which has like a radioactive property and people were like well that's probably valuable so mutants pumped off the back of that and then there was like a leak and just not a leak it was just like a rumor speculation about how um in that other side video in the vehicle there were like all these different characters and someone was like well they will all get mint less allocations like they'll be able to mint so then you know um cryptos were the cheapest nft in that sort of vehicle so they pumped from like one two eight to like four now um interestingly i don't think the other projects pumped a lot cool cats were all the room maybe they did a little bit uh i think it's maybe pumped a little i've been getting some yeah offers on me yeah a lot of speculation i don't know what's true and what's not um and i think that that i don't know it was gaga or one of the founders came out and was like all right it's been leaked but we're just gonna change it up and we're gonna do our own thing um so who really knows do we have any idea obviously the land is for a metaverse but like it is the idea that they're supposed to be kind of ugc like you can build on your land or is the yuga team gonna build on the land do we have any insight into those dynamics because this is something i've been yeah digging into a little bit uh and and would love to actually dig into more and have been listening to some smart people talk about it which is like the success of a platform like roblox for example has been and obviously at centralized but has been people getting to build their own worlds and there's an unlimited amount of land in roblox because anybody can come and then the best games and worlds can bubble to the surface and that's the beauty of it and when i think about a sandbox when i think about their success is predicated not just on them but on their communities building desirable things and this maybe backwards thinking of selling land for the metaverse like will the metaverse and there won't just be one winner but a metaverse that wins what about unlimited land and you just bubble up you figure out a way to bubble up the best land plots to maximum visibility that basically i think i think we'll have both i think those will exist and they'll they'll flourish but we'll also have uh it's it's almost similar to like the cc0 versus commercial property rights argument whereas like we'll have these open meta versus where anyone can build whatever they want and some will rise to the top but then we'll have these places that are like um maybe it is um yooka labs their their meta rpg where they release land and they have like an ecosystem so there's a game involved and land interacts with one another and they build infrastructure themselves they devote a lot of money and resources to building out you know things within that ecosystem and then you think of it more like a world of warcraft where like the company creates the land there's quests there's games there's experiences it's all very narrative driven um yeah and maybe you can build your own things on your plot of land and stuff like that but i think i see it more of a meta rpg as i say it's like it's not a metaverse it's a it's a metaverse role-playing game like this there's a gaming element so there's going to be something like that with their land i think you'll see axia infiniti do a hybrid model uh even within their own ecosystem because they've done this land sale i don't know if you tracked this there was some drama with the axia infinity land recently where x infinity just rolled out x infinity origin which is like their second game and land holders some of them had purchased land like three years ago in axi like i've been holding this for a long time we're hoping that maybe the land would be incorporated in axio infinity origin it wasn't and then there was just some i think fraught community emotions around land not being a bigger part of seemingly the the axie game plan right now um and i think actually being in a little bit this is totally speculative i do not know so please don't but like a tough spot where they've sold land to people now but they maybe want some more ugc kind of a content yeah but then you know what do they do and so i think you probably have a world where they build some games specifically on land that holders have where you can access it only if you own the land and then they have because they specifically said in in some recent community update like that they um there was going to be some free land and that was part of what got people really upset was like are you kidding me you haven't even done anything much with the land that i paid for and you're now yeah teasing that you're gonna offer free land so um i think they may end up in sort of a hybrid situation and you're right that will probably land there land no pun intended yeah land okay um i actually wanted to say one thing on moon birds did you see that we that i didn't touch on a second ago did you see ryan carson's status about um they will automatically force on nest any birds that list while nested did you track this so that briefly yeah okay so just for folks who didn't uh ryan carson obviously part of the moon birds team tweeted out saying we will automatically force like if you're nesting a bird which is basically staking it and you list it on open c for example usually the way that works is if you've staked something and you list it it can't actually be sold what ryan is saying we will force it to basically be unnested so that it will be sold if you list it and the community was like kind of freaking out about this but i believe this is a direct reaction to something that's going on with an elio trades project called the imposters have you been following this i haven't but i've heard about this from other projects yeah okay do you want to explain what can happen or yeah so i think basically uh the reason the community was uh from what i saw from the tree that was backlash is because the way he phrased it i think was not ideal he sort of said it in a way that if you list below floor it will vary a bot will buy it up and like you know your nft will get unstaked or unnested and a bot is going to come and buy it someone's going to buy it so don't and people are like well are they trying to manipulate the floor and say that what he was trying to say i believe is that um it's a solution to a problem that some people would stake an nft or an snft and then go and list well below floor to artificially manipulate the floor price so people say hey the floor while in the real floor might be 12 8 they list something for 40. and then someone else comes along they can't buy your nft so it's just stuck there it's listed at four but it's so it's like a fake floor and then maybe people start listing you know undercutting that maybe they think four is the real flaw and then this person who listed it they go and buy the things that you know is below the real floor and it's it the the automatic unnesting um means that people can't do this but i yeah which i think is a great thing and manipulate the floor that way but people i think read it to believe that they're saying well if you list below floor it's automatically going to sell that's not correct yeah yeah i wanted to clear that up clear that up because i was getting people pinging me or being like what the heck is this and people who clearly didn't understand that this comes from i think a very reasonable place where it you know you don't have nefarious folks trying to force people to panic sell way too low now maybe by friday when this airs this will have been largely cleared up and everyone will understand this but uh i wanted to just flag it and explain what was going on there because i do think there's a lot of confusion about that as a non-moon bird holder i'm you know just you're very invested yeah i want people to make sure they understand things properly it's also just good for people to understand that that can happen because you may be in another project where um where that goes on as more and more projects and include staking and what they're doing okay yeah um do we do do you want to do aku akutars next or we also want to talk about this yeah okay all right again apologies folks if you listened to last week you heard me talk about aquatars already uh i found out zanaka is like not fully up on this project is that fair to say zenika that's basic i had i don't think i'd even heard of it until you mentioned it yesterday and then today i've heard it mentioned in a couple of spaces and like i'm picking up on it um yeah what what is acute okay so i'm going to explain it and then i'll i'll tell folks who listened last week we'll give you the latest updates this is a project and i'm i honestly makes me so bullish that you hadn't heard of it because my my hypothesis last week was that it just for some reason hadn't cut through to a lot of people in the nft space which is funny because it's actually gotten mainstream press pickup because the person behind it is micah johnson who's a former mlb player so it was like the mainstream press would pick it up but i think almost maybe because of that it wasn't able to break through because we're so um allergic to like celebrities in the mainstream in this space okay so michael johnson's former mlb player 2018 i believe it was i'm gonna give you too much information here he gets injured leaves the mlb and i'm imagining had always been artistic but really doubles down on himself as an artist around 2018. some point after i think in 2019 he discovers nfts gets really sucked into that world and some at some point in all of this um he his nephew so he uh micah's black his nephew was black too i'm assuming his nephew said are there black astronauts and this just hit him in this really like oh my god like my nephew doesn't realize that an astronaut can be black he doesn't see enough role models like that yeah so he creates this character called aku who is this little black boy with a big space helmet on and he's he went on to do 10 what he calls chapter drops we did 10 drops on nifty gateway with this character aku ranging i think the lowest drop there were like 700 or 800 and then on the higher end they're like 2 000 per so i think you have about 13 000 or so nfts out there total from from these 10 drops and the drops themselves are are animated and scored and he's worked with some really cool artists i won't be able to get it right now to score these animations i happen to love them i think they're really well done they make me feel something and all connected to the story of aku here's something else that's fascinating about this project he was the first person this was one of the first part it got optioned by anonymous content which is like a pretty big studio like hollywood studio shawn mendes apparently has a production company that was looking at trying to option this to make content out of it he's partnered with puma i know he's talking to epic games like he has all the connections he was visas uh he's in the visa creator program i think he was their first like visa creator um which again all of that could in some ways almost be red flags sometimes like that but he he seems he feels so genuine and like honestly loves the space the story is there the work product that i i see i think is awesome so what's happening now is this week he's dropping akutars which are the 3d avatar version of this aku character and it's designed in unreal engine so it's it's designed to be like game playable um and it's supposed to be feeding into again i don't know i don't know for sure exactly where things down with epic games but my understanding is like far along like they're looking to incorporate this character into epic games things and so to me it's that perfect combination of like cool art well executed awesome story i mean at one point i think it was like two percent of total supply was listed like it was tiny like everyone was diamond handing it so people are really passionate about this project who have bought in um and you know now ah guitars are starting to get some traction there's this mint pass you can buy which is sort of a misnomer because it actually just you'll just get an airdrop the snapshots being taken on thursday if you own a mis a mint pass snapshots taken you get air dropped one of these characters the update that has changed since last week thank you for letting me go on and on about this is um they've announced it'll be a dutch auction for the public sale there'll be there's going to be 15 000 akutars some number of them go to the holders i think there's about 5 000 that they expect to go to on the public sale it'll be a dutch auction starting price has not been announced as of yet um but it will be the price will drop by 0.1 east i believe they said let me pull this up 0.1 eth in some time interval um and this is something that's very interesting you'll appreciate this because we've talked about this they're doing a dutch auction where the lowest price will ultimately be the price everyone pays so if you bid and you buy it higher you will get discounted to the lowest purchaser price that's great which is awesome and like the first project that i've seen actually do that you know it's been the theory we've talked about it a number of times as being a cool way to do something so that's my spiel on aquitar's last thing this was just announced to there will be a half an eighth discount applied to anybody who's a mint pass holder who buys in the public sale so you'll also get discounted um you'll also get discounted if you if you buy in secondary as a as a pass holder so that's good news for the password that's amazing that is amazing i'm i'm bullish um um what so they've got the min passes that you can buy are the comics also for sale yes oh my gosh i'm so glad you asked this so here's the funny thing and i actually i it feels to me like this should be a no-brainer opportunity micah has been very clear that his chapter holders the people who own these first 10 collections are like you know they're his genesis holders they'll be rewarded the most over the life cycle of this ecosystem they're currently and i haven't checked the latest prices there was somebody who bought up a bunch of floor ones at one point this past week so maybe they're up a bit but we're we're trading at such a premium like much cheaper than these akutar mint passes which felt like the supplies if anything the supply of the chapters is lower and they're in the long term life cycle if you're long-term bullish on this project they're going to be rewarded more so that to me is the obvious opportunity everyone's focused on these mint passes right now because it's the immediate thing and i think the 3d avatar thing computes for people more than these like little animations like they recognize but um thinking about it logically the real like value is in getting these chapters you can get them both on nifty gateway or on you know like an open c um it's a little confusing i think this is also why this is yeah let's miss the radar is you have to look you have to find each chapter collection separately and and they trade at different values because there's different supplies on them like it's a little bit confusing to really get in but i i would definitely i bought three chapters about chapter five eight and ten um and i'm looking at ten how much did you pay for ten i paid point four point four one it's 1.3 now are you serious yep on on open seat at least damn yeah okay i should have scooped up even more i mean i i knew it i had such conviction at the time but infinite regret seneca's favorite phrase infinite regret oh yeah maybe they're not trading at as much of a premium anymore again it's it's still life long term uh life cycle of this but yeah i what i would be curious zenika is you know i've obviously just given you a whole word vomit of everything i feel about this project i'd be curious as you maybe go in and dive a little bit like your reaction which obviously does not have to match mine you do not have to love this project the yeah i mean i want to get a mint pass because that seems to make the most sense so there's different types of mint passes as well like there's um there's rarer and less rare mint passes i i will be honest i have not fully dove into this i don't some mint passes yeah it basically different men passes guarantee you different you you can know in advance you're going to get a more or less rare akutar airdropped to you mm-hmm um there's yeah there's og mega og and just random yeah yeah um and me being the floor creature that i have historically always been it just just like you know doesn't pay as much attention to that stuff because i'm like well i probably can't afford the the higher end one but um sounds amazing i'm glad this this project's starting to pop through i still think there's i still think it hasn't fully popped through for people so i still think there's opportunity um and you know i think i think eventually it will i mean who knows but that's obviously where where my money is quite literally yeah yeah i love it i'm gonna get some cool i probably will i might as well after

want you to do the talking here so uh y'all may or may not have heard of the project nemis probably not i still think it hasn't also broken through to the mainstream call it um the reason we're bringing it up now is i am heading to brazil tomorrow more specifically i'm heading to the amazon and i'm going with the nema's team because they are a you know group of brazilian americans many of them uh and their project is very connected to the rainforest i'll let zenika talk more about it but we are going to be shooting really a a documentary we're working with an amazing brazilian filmmaker uh and we're gonna try and create a really beautiful piece of work about what's happening in the amazon right now in this particular area and how this ties into nemus and their project so with that why don't you talk about nemo a little bit amazing that's exciting that's really really exciting nemes is a project that i love i really i found out about it months ago i think uh i think it was late last year and it is to me everything an nft project should be it has all the perfect ingredients for so what they're trying to do is they're trying to save the amazon rainforest and use nfts to empower that and they've done they're approaching in a really thoughtful conscientious manner where they say you can buy an nft which is basically a plot of land on a map that like maps to a certain area of the amazon they have already bought land in the amazon they they've bought it like before they launched the project they they fundraised they've already 1041 000 hectares of land in the brazilian amazon a lot and then they were just like all right so we're going to take part of that chop it up into these blocks and and map it and sell these these plots of land you don't actually own the plot of land but you have like you know nft ownership overreally there's interesting mechanics in at play where like just various things they can do is um if you own a plot of land maybe they put up a camera on different plots and you can just watch your plot of land on the amazon um maybe they generate revenue in from the amazon and if you own a plot of land where they're you know farming brazil nuts or something maybe you get some of that revenue or it's really fascinating that the artwork is amazing um there's game elements there's a dow involved and they're trying to create this whole ecosystem that is absurdly well thought out i i can't do it justice you really need to go look at their website look at who's on their team look at how much depth there is to the project join their discord um i did a youtube video with charlie so i go check out your youtube video with charlie yep it was the first my entire youtube channel came about because i was chatting with charlie um about nemus and the first time we ever spoke and it was maybe i think a 20 or 30 minute call and after like an hour we were still chatting i was just fascinated like he was just talking like this is amazing tell me more and i was like well this would this could this be a great youtube video just like this long form conversation look i'm fascinated i think a lot more people would be as well let's share this and then so the very first video i did was just a rehashing of that first conversation that's just amazing rave and it's it hasn't sold out like people are just not it's not a hype project yeah and i think you mention i think maybe you just mentioned this in your whitney of of why it's awesome the art's stunning like i think the art so good the art rivals art nft projects and it's just like a secondary feature of this one you know like it's this is so much more than just an art project and yet i think the art is absolutely gorgeous so definitely would encourage folks go check it out the other thing i just want to emphasize and and we'll be exploring this in the in the documentary and and hopefully that becomes a really good way for people to really understand this better by seeing it in action the the the ceo right the founder of this project is a man named flavio he's brazilian american his kid's brazilian american they all speak poor portuguese they really split their time in many ways now between brazil and the us and they spend a lot of time with these the local communities that are either on or about the the kind of property they now own in the amazon and their like number one goal is is to make sure that those folks are included that they are a part of this like that they're doing what they want and they've basically every trip they've taken so far to pauwini which is this particular city right by their land has been like a listening tour where they they go around to all these different communities that live nearby and say what do you need like what are you facing like what what do you want so that this isn't something that they're like imposing you know the very colonialist idea of like hey we're from the u.s and we think you should have this right and not being a very backwards way we've just seen that fail over and over again in human history into like terrible results and so they're really conscious of that and they're um their my understanding is is very welcomed by these communities because they've approached it so well and you know again they speak portuguese they they can they speak to everyone locally and so um i want to capture that and but i also want to i want to talk to the local community and and see if i can get sort of honest answers from them hopefully around how they feel about everything that's going on and and that being a huge part of the story but you know crypto being this global connector of infrastructure i think is is that's what's playing out here in this really cool way where it's just connecting they really want this to be a connective tissue between people who whose passion is to protect our environment and the rainforest specifically which is amazing so amazing so amazing uh how long are you going for uh so i'll be in like pout in the amazon for five days it takes three days to get there and and back though so i'm gone for like ten days um but i'm only in the the rainforest itself for uh like four or five days um they're staying a fifth day i think i might be leaving a day early for a couple reasons but um yeah i'm both excited and nervous i'm not the most rustic of people so like camping in the jungle is like not typically my thing but it was an opportunity i couldn't i couldn't turn down yeah uh i hope to visit one day as well i think it would just be such a phenomenal experience i will definitely i mean i i shouldn't say definitely but they're still at the very beginning of this whole journey so i would be very surprised if we didn't in a couple years time do a follow-up to see you know this is sort of the piece laying out the dream and i wouldn't be surprised if there's a follow-up companion piece that's like okay how did it actually play out um did it work and and yeah yeah and so you'll have to come for that one done done deal love it yeah they have really ambitious goals and like they they're like we're going to start with the amazon but we want to change the world in like we want other projects to take our model of yes you know yeah and they have a whole theory about if you can basically if you can do cert i won't do this justice but if you can do this properly with about 10 of the rainforest you can actually protect the remaining hundred percent and they have a whole theory as to how that works so like i think the goal is to get a strategic 10 of the rainforest involved in these kinds of programming and then it becomes a barrier that protects yeah from encroachment like the remaining uh 90 they're they're really sharp and impressive people yeah yeah yeah okay uh also on our agenda today we had somebody really request that we talk about alien friends you and i either you or i are like super read into this project i i've tracked it loosely i i dove a bit more deeply into it yesterday so i'm going to give you the options of the next topics and you're going to pick what we want to do alien friends um there's some cool cats updates which might be worth diving into you mentioned cool cats earlier uh the latest in v friends series two i think that updates quick um yeah some open c stuff launching credit card payment options big deal solana nft is an open c so uh of those four what would you like to dive into next uh let's do v friends and [Music] let's let's do the alien one but i'm gonna be useless i'll be the joke for that yeah okay do you then want to give the friend series two updates or uh i'm usually our v friends yeah expert in-house but you uh i mentioned mine today so that's that's something i'm gonna mint mine probably after this call or tonight depending on my timing if i have meetings right after this they're not revealed yet correct i don't know i've minted i haven't checked okay i think he said they weren't going to be revealed until after public sale which is a bummer because i will be in the amazon and not tracking these things and so i won't be able to degen fully in terms of like doing some trading right after reveal but um oh well yeah it's the beauty of buying projects that you're long-term bullish on i don't really care i don't capture the one moment um okay yeah and there there i'll say there were delays there i mean this was supposed to start minting a week i don't know it feels like they pushed back a lot there was consistent which is you know this was true for befriend series one gary vee pushed back mint on v friend series one by by several days um they struggle a little bit with deadlines over there but he he always delivers so it does not worry me in the least yeah he wants to get it perfect okay speaking of delays oh wait what you wanted to do alien friends not cool cats right uh either either i was going to say speaking of delays cool cats i think that the game is supposed to have finally launched did you see this yeah people cool topi yeah people are playing it um people are playing it people are enjoying it there's quests i think i think even after it launched there were some like tech issues and people were struggling and the floor price like it spiked when they were finally launching it and then it crashed after they were taking issues it's sort of been coming back up now as they've like been working through the issues they haven't taken it down it's not a delay i guess enough people are enjoying it um i feel bad for them honestly the team i know how hard they work for so long and it's yeah i'm i don't know why there's so many issues i'm imagining that's it's got some amount to do with polygon i know that the network has a lot of difficulties but yeah a game is also ambitious i'm wondering and i'm sure they are too potentially in hindsight if that was the right next move i think yeah i think it feels like maybe the the idea there was with this big project you know we have to keep driving the space forward and a game is what everyone promises and if we can be cool cats and actually deliver on it yeah won't that be great and and maybe they underestimated the lift of of what it takes to build a game and it a little bit backfired is is would be my read that sounds about right you know cool pets also have not hatched and i i ended up buying a poop because they were cheap and i and again i think i think things will pump again for cool cats someday yeah um i i'm like confu i don't even know what to do with it and i guess the answer is nothing but i know i was supposed to be feeding it something and i just like i haven't been an entire i feel like they've sort of dropped off the map a little bit yeah i think yeah i i think you can quest or get milk or something with it but i i hear chatter people doing stuff with their cool stuff all right that's the quality of our analysis is really dropped we started off real strong and passionate and we're we're basically just mumble core right now okay well i mean stuff about cool stuff yeah i think it's indicative though i think the fact that you and i aren't super red into it especially you who who owns cats and has for a while like the fact that we're not more read in itself i think says what you need to know about what's happening to cool cats right now which is yeah there was this point where i felt like they were all the rage they had released that trailer and like everybody was just it felt like they totally dominated the conversation and i think all the delays really um yeah hurt them and yeah as well yeah yeah i think that's the right way of putting it people just got tired of waiting and they and so the launch i was surprised to be like oh my god it launched and i hadn't even heard you know i'd sort of had to seek it out and so uh yeah quite anticlimactic um okay alien friends the one i think we've been avoiding yep alien friends okay an incubator or something yes do you want to tell me what you know about alien friends sure alien friends is a i believe a pfp project which has kind of cute art no it it it pumped a lot um i want to say january yeah january's really a big month for them um yeah like it was sort of this whole matter of cute pfp projects and they were like top of the list like uh everyone was a lot of people were rocking them a lot of hype around them and they did really really well i haven't really tracked or followed them since then okay that's a great place to start so i have always been a little bit i'll admit confused about the alien friends thing as somebody who hadn't dived deep into the ecosystem the art didn't happen to speak to me personally i don't tend to be like an overly cutesy gal anyways in terms of what i respond to um and so i i didn't really understand unsurprisingly as you learn with all these they obviously have a really awesome community like seems to be lovely kind and they're obviously passionate about their alien friends the other thing i learned and this i think helps to explain part of the pump in january though i'm sure there are other things um alien friends seems to have a connection to the nalc brothers who do the full send podcast are you familiar with full send only because they launched an nfc project as well right they launched yes they launched an fpt project that was pretty like resoundingly panned by like nft og og nft people that i respect but it sold out you know they made millions of dollars they're they're very popular they're they're bro they sort of feel tangential to me to like the logan paul's of the world you know they fall in that category of like bro we for sure with like a really big following of people um and they're very much in kind of the nft universe of like youtube influencers along the lines of logan paul um so i don't know how this came to be or what the details are but they apparently are connected to the alien friends founders and so it was announced that there would be like an irl event and that that the full send people and that the full time people were there was some sort of nft project that was connected to full send that alien friends would also get access to so this is my takeaway and somebody can come tell me and apologize if i'm wrong but that seems to me to be the thing that explained why this got as big as it did again having that influence or connection yeah and again genuinely a great community and seems like a talented team so it's not to take anything away from that but we know there's plenty of those out there that don't pump or and don't yeah hit the multi evaluation so yeah this latest uh incarnation of what's going on this is a part of their the roadmap they released for this year they have this it's called the alien friends evolution it's a second drop it's sort of pulling from all of the the greatest hits with drops they have something called the incubator uh so you do get a totally separate nft um that's not actually connected to the existing nfts you own but it does have sort of a mutant look to it um you get this like potion thing that you can uh use to you know you can use in your incubator so it has that kind of mad scientist mutant feel to it um but you are getting a totally separate nft um and i think that it's increasing the supply of the collection in total again not unlike we see with all these airdrops and um you know and and the community seems to be excited about it also on the road map you have um like clothing drop coming there's a music album coming and they've actually partnered with somebody who i didn't know the name of but apparently it's a grammy award winner um and they're dropping ufos later this year so it's going to be like a vehicle companion for all of the alien friends i don't know enough about the team to know if this really will all tie to some grander vision or ecosystem or if they're a little bit like treading water trying to do all the things that you're supposed to do quote unquote but um really solid community people who love them yeah it sounds like they're doing some cool things so yeah i mean there are so many projects doing cool things it's really hard to know which ones are gonna quote unquote make it and be around i guess in three to five years from now uh aside from maybe a small handful of blue chips that most people agree will be around but yeah hopefully for their sake and the community state that they will yeah so to to i don't have your twitter handle up in front of me is it that nft guy it might have been whoever it was that seneca and i talked about this i'm sorry that you might be disappointed yes i i saw it as homework i did not have the time to do the homework until now so i apologize yep um i will say the new art i like better than the old art all of the art is cute and i get that there are people who love it again it was never quite my thing you wanted us to talk about the new art i think the new art is cool so there's that um all right coming up on time here so maybe i'll run through just like a couple big things and we can yeah do one um this thread going around about uh somebody getting hacked through their icloud account i think this is more of a psa than anything else i'm assuming you saw the seneca did you have an iphone i have an iphone yeah metamask basically tweeted and said if you use icloud to backup i think if if metamask is backing up to icloud or i don't know exactly what it was but they said well if someone gains access to your icloud um it's possible that they can get access to your seed phrase which is you know in through your metamask so be yeah be very very careful and they had a list of steps on how to you know uh get rid of these permissions and make sure that that's not happening but yeah just just a psa for sure so did you do it did you turn off your icloud your metamask i did i turned it off completely like i just turned off icloud for my phone so i don't i don't need it like why do i need icloud so i wanted the backup so i went in i followed their steps and it was a little confusing because if you get to their final step you actually have to wait a beat in my experience for all of my apps to populate so i i went through their steps got to the final step and was looking at a screen where i i was like what am i supposed to do now so this is a right word i couldn't see meta mask so i just turned it all off yeah okay if you can't see meta mask like just wait wait you kind of have to give it like 30 seconds and then all of your individual apps populate on that screen you can scroll down find metamask and turn it off just for metamask so that was the first thing i wanted to say to folks who maybe like me had seen this and were like i don't want to turn off my whole icloud but god i don't want somebody stealing my metamask either and the way this scam seemed to have been played was they um the the scammers were like trying to get access to the the apple id password for the phone so somebody was getting notifications saying like somebody's trying to log in then they called the person's phone with a fake and made it appear like apple it said like apple inc they made the caller id apple inc somehow so the person thought it was apple and then they said hey it's apple uh we're noticing some suspicious activity on your account which checked out because they've been spamming it um we need the the we're sending a a code to your phone right now to verify that you're the correct owner uh you know can you read us that code and then that code was actually what they needed to be able to get into them wow that's scary that's real sophisticated yeah so it's it's also like those codes that get texted to you they say this on those text messages and they send it like don't ever read it to anybody there's no reason nobody's ever going to call you and ask you for that just don't do it and so once they had access to the person's phone they were able to get it was icloud and that was how they found the metamask data and yeah it was like 625 000 that was stolen wow that's just that's awful i will say uh if you are going to have metamask on your phone a general good rule is to not have it be your main role it just set up a secondary wallet just in case i mean even even if it does if someone you know holds you up at gunpoint on the street and knows that you have a meta mask on your phone they can get access to everything whereas if you only have a couple ethan there well not only a couple of years but like less than what you would normally have in your main wallet um it really limits it limits the um the you know steel pipe attack vector totally totally yeah that's smart okay running through this quickly i don't think we have to analyze it unless you have thoughts you want to i just wanted to flag some new uh entrants to the nft space that that that are big and said they're coming in starbucks apparently i think it may have been a job posting thing starbucks mentioned they're getting into the nft game star trek is going to be coming out with nfts that feels big obviously they're some of the biggest ip in the entire universe when it comes to loyal fans who collect about very exciting yeah so that'll be interesting nice yeah i haven't heard much about either of them yeah nor have i but wanted to flag that it was happening uh tom brady spent half a million on a board ape it looks like and has now partnered with espn to launch a series of polygon nfts it it sounds like so tom has been in it you didn't know did you not know who tom brady was were you i knew who trump brady was i don't know aaron rodgers no i knew aaron rodgers it was uh someone with initials pm pat malone postman patrick mom pat holmes patrick mahomes there you go oh that's funny here we go okay yeah so tom brady uh has been in it because he's a partner on autograph so he's he's been in this now for a little bit and his partner with espn i guess to help they're getting into the space and they're launching on polygon um interesting and that's that any other um i think that's that's about it um yeah it's gonna i'm going on a vacation tomorrow you're going away we're gonna come back it's gonna be a whole new world it's just gonna be who knows what nfts are gonna be around then like three new blue chips maybe 100 i'm terrified i'm like and also because i'm gonna quite literally be off the grid like i can't even indulge the addiction there are going to be a lot of moments i can't even adult addiction if i want to um yeah because i'll be in areas that's a healthy thing yeah i think it's going to be very healthy for me yeah once i let go of the anxiety once i get over the anxiety of not being connected um yeah and so um i love it zenika you're the best thank you so much for joining as always we will uh i will not have a recap episode next week but i have a
