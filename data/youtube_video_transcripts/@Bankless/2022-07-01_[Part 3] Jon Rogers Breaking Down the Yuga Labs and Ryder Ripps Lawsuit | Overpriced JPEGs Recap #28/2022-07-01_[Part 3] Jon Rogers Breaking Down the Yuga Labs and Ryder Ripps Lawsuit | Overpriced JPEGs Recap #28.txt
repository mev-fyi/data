so check it out at metamask dot io slash buy hyphen crypto the yuga labs saga there's there's maybe three things to talk about here there is other side actually they made this big other side announcement so if we're talking about yugo labs i feel like we have to just address the fact that on i believe it's july 16th july 19th they've said that the first like look at the other side metaverse game i guess that they're building out is gonna be revealed they said like the journey will begin the first part of the journey begins so they're moving ahead wanna just start with that i don't think too much has to be said there then the other two pieces are this rider rips you know philly on board nazi club youtube video and and those allegations and then the lawsuit which is connected to those allegations though actually also somewhat separate so i know you are going to do a phenomenal job really talking us through this lawsuit i would like to give my two cents on this youtube video do you want to kick us off or do you want me to rant to you about this youtube video you know i'll kick us off because i know you have a lot of a lot of thoughts on on the youtube videos specifically so and we are very much guilty of burying the lead when it comes to yuga in the last recap podcast we did because it was the it was the big news coming in beginning the week timed perfectly to on the sunday night before the event began so what happened was a a youtuber going by the handle of phillian posted a video um essentially documenting all of the ways in which yoga labs is bored apes could be inspired by or dog whistling and that's the key word here is dog whistling to white supremacist groups uh aryan brotherhood type groups um and all of the research was based on a website that writer rips had created um called gordon goner i think it was gordongonner.com even though phillian does claim and writer rips has tweeted this out that there's no affiliation between the two whatsoever it's just one created the research quote unquote research and the other created a documentary inspired by that research um it kind of started nft nyc off with uh some explosive allegations and i'll kind of wrap this my part of this up is saying that when i first watched it and this was coming right off of the scandal and i'll call it a scandal of what happened with um the announcement of nate nathan to become the brand lead for um crypto punks so what happened is yooka labs had announced that they were going to bring up davis noah davis noah davis sorry thank you for correcting me on that um so there was an insider trading that we talked about that in our recap episode so they had that scandal and right on the heels of that this documentary gets posted so it was kind of a bad week for yuga to begin with my initial take because i was already in a bad mindset around yuga when i saw it was like wow they really got something here they got they got them and as i spent some more time sitting with it and thinking about it a lot of holes began to kind of come in my mind about what is this it's really stretching a lot of similarities a lot of innuendo so i i began to really doubt it at that point but i was not in the best yugo mindset when the week began when this this hit so what was your take on it i think this is such horseshit i think you set this up well because you you you were like it's alleging their aryan brotherhood and nazi and white supremacists and the point is like they are just they are pulling from the canon of all evil things to say that bored apes has a similarity to that and i think that there was um an input magazine article that covered this actually like from like a month ago or a couple months ago not even in this since this most recent filion episode and they interviewed somebody who's with the anti-defamation league the adl right which is a big you know anti-anti-semitism group and you know like tracks hate groups and is really this is what they they do professionally is to to monitor these things and he put it really well the guy they interviewed in this this article i'm gonna pull this quote up he said um if you're an extremist you have a set ideology you don't dabble in different kinds and that's the thing that's so strange is they're just like oh well they're referencing this random number that means something to this hate group and they reference this thing that could be the year that somebody was in a nazi prison so i'm like i've gone crazy and i watched the video and was like this seems ridiculous to me and like complete or and then i re-watched the video and took notes on every allegation they made and every time it's like like they're like oh they use guanon and makaka or whatever like they use two monkeys and these monkeys get brought up in you know 4chan and you're like if you google any monkey if you search 4chan for any monkey name like it's used in a racist way like they don't think about could could you know it's like the number they use the number i i forget the number 14 or there's 18 in the board ape you know thing and you're like if you like there's so many numbers that actually i was looking up like what are what are the numbers that have like racist symbolism and and it's like 88 and it's 14 and it's 311 and it's 37 like again you you you could find this for so many things and um the cowabunga i mean the most ridiculous one to me was they were like one one of the founders girlfriends had cowabunga in her instagram handle and this was one of the ones that yugo labs addressed directly like she's mexican-american and she likes mutant ninja turtles like cowabunga is just an expression that people use um and i mean there was even one the anti-defamation league guy was like i literally had to google this reference it was um which one was it there was like some reference that they were like this is a comment oh the kali hugo the surfing the kali yuga they were like oh that's a common yeah that's like this common alt-right thing and the adl guy was like i have studied white supremacy for 27 years and i'd like look this up this is not like a super common reference you know they were like ape hands as a reference to some french king who would chop off the hands of of congolese bell you know and i'm like and then you google i i searched apans and 4chan nothing like that comes up like so this is like some crowdfunded knowledge pool again they're drawing on the canon of all evil things that have ever happened so you have some person out there who happens to know that eight pans were what belgians chopped off congolese hands and it's like that's what they're referencing here and i i honestly find the thing completely absurd now here's the only compelling pieces of actions in my opinion i think i think it's been a big miss on hugo lab's part that they haven't just come out and denounced white supremacy and nazism like that just feels like an unforced error i don't believe they're white supremacists or nazis at all i don't believe they've taken inspiration from white supremacists or nazis at all you know they've come out with their own statement calling it absurd um in a couple different ways and kind of debunking some of this but i do think it's like just announce it i don't need you to apologize because i don't think they have anything to apologize for and i don't need that headline like they apologize for their accidentally racist imagery but i do need them to i would like them to like just like be like we absolutely denounce nazism and white supremacy in all ways and not doing that feels weird um yeah and i also think some of their traits are like cringy and weird and probably just in and of themselves shouldn't exist and i don't know to what extent to put that at the feet of the founders and to what extent to put that at the feet of um designers because they worked with design partners to create these traits now of course they had final say um but but clearly there are some traits like the the japanese like head band and some of like the fez like some of these things i think are um the persian uh the prussian hat yeah yeah you know i have a couple things there first of all you know phillian who created this video po started this video starts off with you don't know 4chan i know 4chan trust me on this because i know 4chan and you don't this is true and no no no yes you're right i don't know 4chan i've not been unfortunate i don't care to ever be on 4chan but just because you've been on it doesn't mean that you're the expert on kind of this kind of content in that space and there's a lot of other people who monitor that site and watch this so they would have spoken up the other part about this about i want to go back to your point about the comment uh the response from from the yugo labs team and daniel tenor who goes by the handle of um uh swambat on on twitter uh had a good tweet thread about how should they respond and um concealing he published his tweet there like hours before they actually you actually did and we came back with was really two things one was they should make a strong statement renouncing it now normally with something like this you would say we're not even going to justify this with a response but i do think they needed to create a very strongly worded short it can only be can even be one paragraph statement of just we absolutely denounce this we resent it we would never do that period um so they didn't make their statement it wasn't quite it was written by wadley arenau um it wasn't quite as strong as what i would have liked it was a bit more of a let's go through the points that they've raised and we're going to go through and give you evidence to refute all of them but it was but they didn't refute all of them they didn't do a comprehensive reputation which which is why i was like you know i i i thought their statement was a little weak but and i yeah they need that once paragraph just we absolutely denounce it and then once they have that paragraph out there they can always refer to it in the future just saying you know what we've talked about this here's our statement absolutely i agree i i totally agree that that was a miss again as somebody who completely in absolutely no way thinks that that any of this is even a little bit legitimate also if you want the other conspiracy theory ryder rips did post somewhat recently that um he said you can read my senior thesis from 2008 if you like it's about how in the future people will only respond to lowest common denominator click bait because they won't read or look into anything so anyone will be able to get famous online by just marketing garbage like this and he was responding to a racist thing but the irony is that's like almost feels like his playbook is people aren't going to look deeper at the flimsiness of his allegations so all they're going to say are the headline and you're going to be able to manufacture i'm like i think he's the troll they're using 4chan tactics like this is a big troll on their part that they know is that they're perpetrating for fame and because this is his playbook he this is he does this like kind of viral online marketing stuff so that's my conspiracy theory back at your writer well it's a it's a good segue because um i guess the question is what was ryder rips doing in terms of the creating the source content that inspired this video and what was his what was his goal and accomplishment was he trolling them was he looking to make a just a bigger statement about culture um was this a scam it's these questions are out there and um part of this is gonna come out in the in a process because yuga has filed a lawsuit against ryder rips um jeremy kayan can i think is how you pronounce his name also known as poly0x on twitter um and 10 john does who have not yet been identified and they decided they responded and they responded with a a left-hand right-hand kind of punch um i i like their response i think they should legally uh protect themselves and now to be clear just to start setting this this next part up they're not suing about the content of that video or of the website that inspired the video they're suing they're not suing over allegations of racism and nazism they're not assuming like they're not claiming libel you know obviously they think it's lies it's not about that exactly they're suing about trademarks and so what ryder rips did and his his team um they created a collection identical to the board ape yacht club so the apes eight three five six whatever and they minted a collection of five of the ten thousand that were identical in every way they they outright copied it now this is where we're gonna get into some of the semantics here because it's important and really going to be an important case so number of people in coming this is going to be a groundbreaking case an nfts if it goes to court and i fully agree i'm really excited to see how this plays out because it is potentially going to set precedent for the space and we're going to learn a lot through this process so if it does get to court it's going to be uh i can already see supermassive from the defiant you know broadcasting live from the federal courthouse in la nft court tv um style uh i will be there right next to him i i i um embrace the opportunity to become a courtroom reporter i'm ready you and i will be like the live yeah i'll be there with you and we'll we'll live podcast after each day of course it's kind of like a lot of films when she was on track that's what i was gonna say yeah the drop out and uh bad blood yeah oh we could publish a book we gave the series on hulu about the board ape rider rips thing i'm it's doing it i meant to do it who is that after this neil strauss is writing a book about board apes he came up in the philly on uh video um yeah well yeah we'll we'll offline continue so they're setting this up for a trademark violation because what ryder rips did is he copied 5000 of the apes and minted them under the rider rips board apioc club collection title on openc and other marketplaces um and he got 5000 of them done they were each minted one by one quote by hand and that's going to come important in a second and eventually they were taken down assuming yuga labs put in complaints to the marketplaces and these were taken down but the suit isn't is about trademark violations about the copying of the collection and and crimes or misdeeds that are attributed to the copying of that and so there's a lot there now so let's begin if we want to talk about kind of who who labs is engaging so they've hired a law firm out of san francisco mountain view called fenwick and west they're definitely a big high-profile tech oriented law firm they hired it the lead attorney is eric ball who has represented peloton twitter uber intel google facebook and many others so and his quote-unquote is trademark litigation partner so uh probably a boring area of law but a a very interesting area of law in our case here is trademark litigation which tells you that they do intend to litigate this case um and the court the case is being filed in the district in central california which covers the los angeles region it's probably why they hired a la area i mean sorry a california law firm and this is a federal trial because of interstate commerce matters so it's being said in the federal system uh legal system you mentioned these 10 john does they're they're filing it against jeremy who is uh ryder rips his partner essentially in this explain to us we don't know who specifically by name these ten john does are but why they're they're defendants in this case correct there's um and they're broken into two groups does one through five and does six through ten and there's a distinction between the two groups does one through five or other partners in the project help to set it up help to create the collections help to manage it they don't know who those identities are yet and i wonder if one through five isn't the exact number if it's just a placeholder number it could be one through three or one through ten but there's that first group of does who were active participants with ryder and jeremy the other does six through ten are individuals who purchased nfts through the collection through the ryder rip's collection and then promoted their nfts as being authentic board ape you labs nfts so it's essentially false uh kind of stealing of their brand and their credibility for their own use and purposes so that's why there's two distinctions and in the court case there's 11 causes of action so the lawyers for yuga are representing that there's been 11 different um examples of of misdeeds here and does 6 through 10 are not named in all 11. they're only named in like three or four of them whereas does one through five jeremy and ryder are named at all of the all of the 11 cases for action immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable offers massive

bankless and so what is yuga asking for here what are they hoping to achieve from this lawsuit by what they're hoping is by jury yep so they are asking for a jury trial and that tells me that they want the public they want the public visuals of this they want the attention they want to they're going to make they want to make a statement they wouldn't hire this law firm this attorney go to this trouble unless they intend to see it through which is why a lot of people online were saying oh this is a joke they'll never see it through i don't see it that way i think if they've gone to this level they intend to go to to see it in court they want they want their day in court they want this all brought out and they want to end this from ever happening again if you stand up to a bully i'll just say if you don't stand up to a bully when they're in your face they're gonna come back again so this is now standing up to who these people they perceive as bullying them and what they're asking for is a number of things they're asking for a court order against writer rips and defendants to stop just stop you can't do anything with anything board ape period it's an all stop second they want the destruction of all infringing matter and that's kind of an interesting one because how do you destroy a digital piece of art you could delete the collection off of openc which they've already done so how is that done and there has to be a written report as to how they did it that accompanies that that step third they want the withdrawal of all applications for trademarks so that sounds like ryder rips has made applications for ryder rip's board and hot club train marks so they want those withdrawn fourth they want a judgment a financial judgment in the amount of yuga's damages to be determined in court what those actual damages are plus all of rider rips profits plus yuga's legal fees and costs and finally they want a judgment for enhanced impunitive damages so they want a punishment judgment as well they want money they want money to punish them for having done this in the first place as i say this is a multi-million dollar lawsuit these we already know that ryder rips made several million dollars on this collection so this is a and the legal fees are going to be astronomical for this kind of a law firm to represent them so this is a this is going to be a huge judgment if they win it this is so much bigger than just this case and i i think it is it's interesting that it's this case because it's gotten so high profile because of the salacious nature of the the accusations and the kind of horrendousness of the of the accusations but what we're really talking about here is can you copy an nft and the people in the ryder rip's camp seem to have this rallying cry which is you can't copy an nft because of the providence piece and because of the blockchain piece and you can go and and they each have a unique identifier that's what makes them non-fungible and so they are claiming you cannot copy an nft because of that and that's a fundamental property of the blockchain um i semantically speaking of course they're right and of course the fact that you can't copy an nft is why the right click save people don't have an argument because fundamentally taking a picture of the mona lisa doesn't mean you have the mona lisa but on a regulatory level i completely support projects being able to go after uh projects like this that are that are copying their works i mean you're seeing this problem with artists right where people are minting other artists work and then pushing them out as if they were the artist's work and i'm i'm very in support of artists being able to protect what is theirs not because you can't technically go and see the distinction and see the difference but because we need to get rid of like spam and scam in this space and there are going to be newcomers who are going to come in and see a you know see the wrong board ape and and purchase it and think it's real and get confused and writers saying oh we've taken every precaution so you're not confused you don't think this is a real board ape blah blah blah blah i'm not buying it i think as a precedent you absolutely need to be able to protect your intellectual property if you're a project that creates distinct art and i i love the providence piece of the blockchain i think that's why this makes them collectible i still think you you should be allowed to sue and go after folks who who copy your work yeah yeah i i um you know the way i see it is like you their argument is that if you because the the code behind every nft is unique in the token that copying an nft might look the artwork might look the same but the code in the token is different because there can only be one token and so it's saying what matters here is that the token the uniqueness of the token or is it the uniqueness of the visual that represents the token and i have a feeling there they're on a losing side of this argument in the current court system and there's and jeremy's put out some tweets about we're fighting for the art we're trying to change copyright law you don't change copyright law with a lawsuit legislation changes copyright law and judicial judgments change copyright law based on that legislation so you're not going to be winning lawsuits go on precedent exactly so you're on the losing side of that argument it doesn't mean that you know it's not worth fighting for if it's important but you should be talking to your your congress lady or your congressman not you collabs as attorneys to try to get copyright law changed this is not a uh legal opinion here that i'm about to provide but like it's about what are you fundamentally right if you're not fundamentally an art first project right like if what you are is a protocol and you know and it's about the smart contract and the code then sure i'm i'm open to that concept but if you're talking about something that is first and foremost about the visual and not about the smart contract code i i just don't buy that and i um i think router reps is full of and i think he is uh and i look i get his career has been about pushing boundaries but i um i mean i think these are areas that the space will benefit from some more web 2 style regulation i i really do i like i love the ethos of web 3 and this to me does not infringe upon decentralization on any of the ways that it really fundamentally matters and what it does if this whole space is about empowering creators this is a this is a tool that's going to be in the arsenal of creators to keep them empowered right like this is this is good for the the creator class that we are so concerned with here in in this space because it gives them instruments to protect themselves from people trying to um profit off of their work so i i look forward to this is there is there a piece we should be talking about or thinking about here when it comes to the fact that individual board ape holders have rights over their apes and it's not just you know hugo labs can initiate this but the holders have rights as well i know jimmy has already you know jim mcnellis has already made a joke about seemingly that he is going to sue ryder rips because ryder rips his profile picture is literally uh jimmy's ape so um what should we be thinking about when it comes to that yeah yeah i'm glad you brought that up in fact i did not know that ryder rips pro pfp was is jimmy's ape but that's that's that's interesting um so there is this is just fat this is one thing that makes this fascinating is that we have for the first time art that the owners have some commercial rights in jimmy is creating uh um bay what's the band called again kinship he's leveraging the commercial interest in his apes and creating a product creating an entertainment product with that and so this is the first time that this is yuga suing on behalf of their own behalf but not on behalf of their owners but the question is can jimmy sue or could any board ape owner sue for lost economic opportunity around their ape because of the actions that um uh that ryder rips took i have to believe the answer is yes i believe that this damaged or could have damaged the economic opportunities for those individual eight boners you know feature so the folks i do some advising with they launched their ip marketplace a few weeks ago which is now actively taking putting deals together for ape owners and world of women and and commercial partners and do those deals have less value less potential as a result of this and i believe the answer is yes at the very least they can make a claim that the yuca brands have been diminished in some way it makes their apes a little bit less valuable with this halo kind of this cloud of controversy hanging over their heads and if this turns out that writer is found liable in the yuga suit could there be a class action on behalf of those 5 000 apes that were minted by rider for the diminished economic opportunity i think the answer is yes this is a dumb question i'm about to ask but that's we're about here is getting to the truth what rights does yuga have over these individual apes that allows them to sue ryder as opposed to the individual holders being the ones to sue ryder they're not suing about the individual apes that were minted by writer trademark it's the trademarks so they're suing for the misuse and quote-unquote tortious interference of their trademarks and what are what are literally it's literally you go lab or board ape yacht club the name this is where it gets a little bit messy so yuga has trademark multiple trademark applications pending they've actually not yet been granted any trademarks officially yet but the applications are pending they've been pending for over a year that's not unusual it takes a long time for the trademark office to to process one or two of them have been sent back with follow-up questions that also is not unusual um i've had to submit a lot of trademarks and had those back and forth with the trademark office i do believe trademarks are still enforceable while they are in the application process it just if the application is rejected then you can't make a claim that you own the trademark so but i believe that they're still enforceable so yuga's within their rights to to do this um the other thing that's interesting about the trademarks that yuga has um which are specifically around the skull with the kind of the black circular the 18 teeth yeah the 18 teeth um the the um i think around the bayc tag and then the they have multiple versions of that so it's around their brands and there's their logos is where this suit is coming and that's kind of where they're basing it what's interesting about what you guys filed for trademark applications is that you can tell that they came into this when they created the collection without much of a trademark strategy because they filed their first trademark application a month after the minting so this is like may of last year they minted i think in april so like a month later oh april 30th hitler's death date which they brought up as if that meant something don't get me started they also didn't they didn't mint on april 30th they mentioned before and and the new york the new yorker journalist apparently got that wrong and printed it as being april 30th and then in the philly on video phileon phrases it like they made a point to tell the new yorker that their mint was on april 30th which is completely editorializing because he has no idea if board apes actively told them to call it april 30th or not and board apes is claiming no we didn't tell her it was april 30th she just made a mistake so anyway but just sorry not to realize you're you're still stuck on the video carly i'm moving on i've watched so many hours of this video i literally have like point by point dissected it which i'm not gonna bore people with continue please john uh so i was saying that they didn't seem to have much of a strat this is one of the curiosities that came out of the suit which is uh the filing which they didn't seem to have much of a strategy around trademarks because they have submitted trademark applications on maybe seven or eight different dates in the last 18 months and i believe each time they've gone back with new trademark applications it's been to add categories of oh digital downloads oh digital games so i think they have to keep going back to add new categories so they're probably keeping their trademark lawyer um pretty pretty happy right yeah so that was one of the curiosities that came out of this is that um how they've approached their trademark applications but those applications are valid they are pending and that's what this suit is about those trademarked out trademarks so so board apes so so you go labs is suing them about the trademarks and so we could we see like a class action lawsuit comprised of a whole bunch of holders who are suing ryder for commercial use of those apes specifically that's what you alluded to earlier the answer seems to be yes and could that be like a class action like they all joined together because they're all aggrieved similarly yeah well there's two different groups here there's the group of the 5 000 that were minted out of the 10 thousand so there that's one group that has a certain kind of claim then there's the whole group of ten thousand who could be part of a class that say hey we had economic interest in these these these nfts and because of what you've done with these accusations we our economic interest is diminished we don't have as much opportunity to monetize these these these characters and so we're together we want you to pay us to compensate us for that so i think there are potential for class actions i'm not a lawyer so um i would certainly if i were if i were in this group i'd be i'd be trying to rally people to join me i'd be one of the people that'd be like yeah we're going to sue them and i'd be trying to rally some of the folks to join me totally at least get some advice on that if i were an ape holder i would similarly be doing that well what's interesting you know i can get all riled up about this you know fundamentally i recognize it's a distraction and it's somewhat meaningless in the sense that it doesn't seem to have affected the price of board apes at all now they've of course fallen quite precipitously in the bear market generally but this video had absolutely no impact on them and you know you have this just incredibly lame rallying cry at the end of the filion video that's very like let's go show these guys and stop listing your board ape at a good price and you know the the a price is fine the other deed land the other side metaverse land parcels are through the roof because of the announcement that they're gonna do some sort of other side thing so um i will close with this and then i'll give you a closing statement what what i seem to be seeing on twitter again i think the the prevailing sentiment is that this is is dumb but i do see people who seem to be like there's something fishy here and um again i absolutely i think if you really dig into each of these accusations individually like there's just so many alternatives available for any of the one individual like accusations and they're so scatter shot these accusations they're so non-coherent with one another like again like they're just like randomly evil dudes who just cherry-pick weird random things that have easily been done in history to make references to it's just like it's nonsensical in my opinion if you if you really dig in but i understand um the discomfort people feel hey because obviously these are very serious acquisitions accusations and we don't want anything that feels even remotely like this in this space if you're a good person and i also think google labs is so private and so kind of mysterious and such a black box and i do think that nicole uh munez if i'm pronouncing that right like does come across like a little awkward and like a little off in the in the interview she gave um which i actually do not see as an indictment of her i see it as like she's a little bit awkward you know and and um people read into that and so so i i'm sympathetic to people who feel that way and i would say don't it feels like a a boo radley situation or something you know like don't jump to the conclusion that someone is bad or that there's something kind of evil or nefarious going on just because there's something kind of quiet or mysterious or misunderstood about this group which i i share i share a feeling of sort of like who and what is hugo labs and i've been critical of them before i don't think they've um executed at the level of praise and untouchableness that they sometimes get like i actually think they've executed well but that they're like not i think doodles has executed much better actually um so i i understand that feeling but i i would really say don't leap to the conclusion that that makes them neo-nazis because i really reject that yeah i'll wrap my my kind of final statement by saying that you know i i mentioned that when i first watched this because i was in a bad spot in terms of my feelings towards yoga when it came out that i was gonna be like wow they got something here where i've kind of ended up with this is no this is not true there's nothing valid here if there's any criticism or things that could be said about it from the yugos perspective is that perhaps they didn't understand some of the semiotics around the art that they were creating and certainly didn't take the care that maybe they should have to really understand what they created better but i'll put that to just being kind of new new new in the space in terms of launching collections and um naivety and maybe perhaps just a little bit of of just not doing the full due diligence that they should have but i don't believe that there's any validity to it i don't believe that any of them are secretly 4chan with dog whistling to 4chan neo-nazi types it's it's not it's not true all right well that concludes our yuga labs special breaking down at least what we know so far about this lawsuit about the rider rips board api club scandal in the first place i'm gonna be closely tracking this i think this is precedent setting i think it's fascinating it it it uh is interesting to me like tabloids are interesting you know in that dark sort of watching a car crash kind of a way and it's also interesting for me from a substantive how will this space play out from a legal and regulatory perspective so thank you
