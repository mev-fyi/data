yo welcome bankless nation something cool recently just happened andre the famous developer of the wiring system just released this new system called stable credit usd and it's a pretty unlike and also very like other protocols that we've seen in this space and so uh it's we i've gone on this little journey to try and understand it right and so i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen and i've gone through a little process and this is going to end with me bringing on andre onto the bankless youtube uh to walk me through the the actual system but before we get there we're going to go on this journey together right um because this was a journey for me and this is going to be a journey for you too all right so on september 10th which is uh that was yesterday wow today's the day that the sushi swamp founder gave all of the ether that they stole back so that's already like pretty insane uh never a dull day in d5 but okay so yesterday urine finance tweeted out uh introducing a stable credit a new protocol for a decentralized lending stable coins and amms and chris black comments i read that i read this three times and i still don't fully get it somebody explain like i'm five please uh and so this is kind of what i'm trying to do all right so here it is introducing stable credit a new protocol for decentralized lending stable coins and amms andre who wrote this goes through some of the existing infrastructure that we all know like you can mint a token a synthetic asset by providing a contract with a valuable asset largely ether right and this is dye and maker dao and then you can take this a little bit further and you can uh turn this into a lending protocol like compound or ave where you can provide ether or another asset as collateral and this gives you a line of credit in ether in dollar value terms and therefore then you can borrow other collaterals that other people have provided as debt right and so like you submit ether and then you can borrow wbtc or or you know lend token or synthetics and you can do that in ave or in any compound um and then there's automated market makers like we know of like uniswap and balancer and and so andre puts this in an interesting way where he says unisop creates a tension between two assets so if you provide ether and die it attempts to keep the ratio between these two assets equal in dollar value terms right so if ether becomes more expensive traders will add dye to the pool to take out ether because of the arbitrage then the pool has more dye than ether and this equates to ether becoming more expensive because the ratio between these two shifted and now that is the new canonical ratio so if you had one eath one die and then a trader adds one diet removes half an eat then that half in each is now worth to die like it's now it's the new price and this we don't we know these things that we're all comfortable with these things i hope if you're on the bankless journey with us and then there's something called a utilization ratio and this is where things start to get a little bit unique and andre writes automated market makers can also be seen as decentralized utilization ratios if we consider a lender has 100 die and zero die is borrowed then the utilization ratio is zero percent the cost to borrow one die is one die this means that is no there is no premium to borrow die but if there is 90 borrowed died and that utilization ratio is 90 and this creates a borrow premium the cost to borrow one die is greater than one die so this this starts where i start to get got a little bit confused and this is where i went to dc investor and then andre himself eventually for help understanding this so uniswap as we just explained here you know unit swap reprices things based on the ratio of two assets and andre is taking this a different spin but it's also the same thing but he's just instead of calling it like a a ratio uh and therefore a price of the two assets he's considering this rather to be a utilization ratio by a protocol right it's how much of an asset has a protocol utilized and it's using the amm curve to determine this um i'm i'm still wrapping my head around this so if you're if that was confusing to you like it's still confusing to me uh and then andre goes into something that he calls single-sided amm exposure and he writes based off the concept a tokenized transfer token uh we designed why swap exchange more information here and then i'll link this article in the show notes the concept was simple in amm such as uniswap you have token a ethe and then also token in each to token b a trade of token a to token b can be described as token a to e to token b right and so what what he's saying is like all right so and uniswap v2 actually does this right so say you want to trade your synthetics token for ave for for for lend right and so you want to go from snx to lend but the snx lend trading pair in uniswap i bet you i'll batch it probably doesn't even exist and if it does it's extremely illiquid but ether is extremely liquid right ether is the most liquid asset on ethereum and so it's much more advantageous to go from synthetics to ether and then ether to lend token right and so you know using um you're using some basic algebra right since you can just cut ether out of that same of that same uh equation and then you just go from token a to token b you just use ether in the middle right uh and so ether andre writes can be seen as a transfer token mechanism right itself does not need to have value when it is created destroyed it must simply abide by creation destruction rules this allowed us to develop an amm with a single-sided exposure i'm not too sure what he meant by this when it's created and destroyed um i think he's talking about a new possible token a new token that it can be created and destroyed to facilitate this token transfer mechanism and that's what i think this stable credit uh token is right stable credit is a protocol that combines tokenized state debt stable coins lending amms and single-sided amm exposure to create a completely decentralized lending protocol so here's where he gets into explaining stable credit you can provide any asset and create tokenized credit called stable credit with this process and the cool thing is it's very similar to synthetics where like stable credit usd can actually just be stable credit insert your asset of choice here right this is just usd is just an oracle right it could be he says it also could be you know the euro or the japanese yen or it could be gold or it could be bitcoin it could be like stable credit ether for for all for all i know uh and so here's the process so you come and use provide an amount of collateral right like a thousand dollars of usdc the uscc price oracle is used to determine the value of one usdc so you need to know that the this thing actually has a price right and so this is using chain link shout out to the chain link marines um and then to the protocol mints the value of the collateral you deposited times the usd value of stable credit usd i think then the usdc and the stable credit usd is provided into the 50 50 automated market maker which is uniswap he's talking about uniswap here then the protocol calculates the system utilization ratio up to a maximum of 75 percent and then the utilization ratio value of the supplied usdc is minted as a stable credit usd all right so that's kind of where i got lost and if you just did sorry we're going to fix that at this point your stable credit usc is your lending credit you can use it to borrow by or kka buy via the amm buy via uniswap other assets so that if another user provides link as collateral you can borrow link by selling your lending credit when you want to repay your debt you can sell the link back for stable credit usd pay off your debt and receive your uh your usdc all right so that was that was a lot so let's go into what dc uh tried to interpret another urine announcement which i've if i'm interpreting correctly could be a huge effing deal and here's that tweet that we started with details are sketchy but here's my take i'm thinking of this like an asset collective deposit an asset and then you get borrowing rights up to the required collateralization ratio for that asset if the value of your initially deposited asset declines below the acceptable collateralization ratio you lose right to your deposit due to liquidation which in this case could be virtual quote unquote read on this effectively creates a new single-sided amm lending service allowing allowing to deposit any supported asset and mint a new urine debt token which is also a stable coin this is similar to how die works deposit eth or any other asset print die now all of a sudden that debt token becomes a currency which you can use with the urine amm exchange to buy any token that the user has deposited there i'm not sure if this uses a pricing curve structure by a traditional amn but i i lean towards no if that's correct that means you'll that means that you could run out of certain assets from time to time meaning that you will not be able to withdraw your originally provided collateral could be wrong on this uh dc uh well about to get into this um he is right but also meaningfully no he won't actually be able to you will be able to withdraw your assets probably based off of incentives um you will still have your available collateral stealing and debt tail constable coin and you could go buy more of that asset or wait until someone redeposits it and pay off your debt and withdraw let's see a simple way to explain this is imagine one giant maker multi-collateral vault accepting all sorts of assets all right so that's like the best summary so far that we've gotten like it's one gigantic maker vault but think of it also like a compound or ave where you can deposit many many assets into them or yeah multi-collateral also works in this mod in that model you deposit any acceptable asset print die up to that amount then you can buy any collateral that's been deposited into the same vaults by anyone else using that printed die your debt obligation remains and if you want to recover your initially deposited collateral you need to pay off that debt directly and you may have times when you can't recover your initial collateral due to shortage of the asset based off of the utilization ratio uh okay and then uh and then so i take this uh what dc investor just put in the uh finance subreddit and i go and i tweeted andre it's like hey can you confirm that this is right because like dc isn't totally true either and andre goes yes it's solid only points to a difference that the pricing curve uses standard constant product market maker implementation to add a premium discount to utilization ratios andre explains this very well in the interview that we're about to get to um and so that that's kind of where we are um that's kind of where we are uh so i'll link to all of these things uh in the in the show notes um so check them out let's go ahead and get right into the interview with uh andre uh that he where he can explain this uh better himself but first we've gotta talk about of it ave is a money market protocol which i've mentioned so far which you can deposit assets into and then borrow other assets as well right and so the cool thing about ave is that you have both the option to have a variable interest or a stable interest stable is nice people like stability it allows you to have long-term thinking so um if you want to get a line of credit and stable you can go and deposit assets into ave and get that also monolith monolith is this very awesome system where if you want to spend your dye in the real world you can get the monolith defy account which has a actual defy card like an a real life debit card that connects to your smart contract while on ethereum so that when you swipe your debit card you make a transaction on ethereum so check them out at monolith.xyz unstoppable domains unstoppable domains is dope because you can generate a single human readable name for all of your crypto assets bitcoin litecoin ethereum you can uh and you can link all of these things together inside of one human readable domain like across multiple blockchains so that's super cool um so long as the wallet that so supports unstoppable domains uh you can like have like for example i have davidhoffman.eth i can tell bitcoiners to send bitcoin to davidhoffman.eth uh it won't show up in my ethereum wall it'll show up in my bitcoin address and i link that with unstoppable domains lastly there's zapper zapper is my new block folio right and so this isn't my wallet but this is an example wall you can go to zapper and it will tell you where all of your assets are right and so in this particular dummy wallet um they have a bunch of different assets in a bunch of different places but you can also invest in different things in the d5 world right through zapper right so it's like the front page of d5 making it really really easy and lastly if you have not yet go to the bank list youtube and hit that subscribe button because we are trying to keep the bankless nation as up-to-date as possible uh through youtube's uh videos like this as well as uh tutorials by defy dad and then i read a bunch of articles aloud and then we have our weekly state of the nation and podcast right so make sure you subscribe so you know exactly what the hell is going on in this crazy world and without further ado let's go right into this explanation from andre where he explains this thing and how it came to be way better than i ever could so thanks for listening all right everyone we're bringing andre right into the bankless youtube to get andre to explain what this new stable credit system is so um andre first off thanks for thanks for coming uh thanks for getting up giving up your time i know you're a very busy individual but me and me and dc investor were going back and forth trying to understand what this new stable credit system is and so bringing you on the bankless pod to help explain it to us step by step and so first off thank you for coming on and welcome now it's a pleasure man i i appreciate you having me on at at a time like this um i mean sushi swap just returned all of their let's call it stolen eve and uh everyone's going crazy and here we are talking about this system so yeah cool let's do it yeah yeah lots of going on always in the d5 space never a dull moment uh and i think uh this kind of slipped under the radar yours uh stable credit announcement um a little bit because um it's it's a many different things all stitched together uh and so you you start you're the article with a few primers um we know how maker works right you submit die or you spent ether into a maker default to produce dye and dye is just this synthetic asset based off of a price feed and then we also have lending protocols like compound where you submit many assets and you can borrow other assets so long as you uh keep a reserve ratio and then there's also the automated market makers like uniswap and balancer that we all know and love uh and then utilization ratios like like like in avi and compound uh but then we get into single-sided amm exposure and stable credit which are new to me can you kind of walk us through the construction of stable um stable credit uh out of urine and a where did this idea come from and then let's let's kind of get together with how all these money legos came to be in to create stable credit so the the original actually came from from yswap um exchange that i was busy working on which is basically a modified uni swap that allows for single-sided exposure so so a a big part of yearn um anyone that has interacted with the vaults or the strategies would know that i don't do impermanent loss strategies reason for that it makes it makes the decision making tree far too complex because now you have to decide which asset you take out if you take both out where do you sell the other one where do you get best ratios and it's it's not always a positive sum which i don't like so i started working on on single sided liquidity provisioning so using unit swap one as an example unit swap one everything was paired to eve it didn't matter what you did if you created a unisop pair it was die to if it was usdc to if it was linked to eve it didn't matter so the the fascinating thing about that is it actually meant that if itself didn't matter because if was just this transfer token used underneath it just had needed to have enough liquidity in the system so the trades could happen without affecting slippage too much so if was the perfect candidate because i mean it's it's it's the the most liquid acid on ethereum so it was great for unit swap one that's why even in unisop2 most pairs are wrapped if because it's still one of the most liquid assets right so so so that was the goal was just to create a system where you had the single side exposure and you didn't worry about the if pair and so what's the benefit of that you can so you can just deposit just ether into a an amm and you can receive fees just based off of ether correct so so it's it's there's there's three important caveats to mention here number one is yes you only provide a single asset the system provides the counter asset right so in in this case you would provide if the system would say one if is equal to 400 transfer asset and then it would mint 400 transfer acid and put in your eve and the transfer asset so now if if if if's price declines that's that's okay because when you withdraw you get back more if because you're a percentage of this pool so now more if was put into the pool you withdraw i have more if i'm happy so my net sum is about the same if if became more expensive it means i now have less if so what happens then is you are actually given the the transfer token you're given the proportion you're withdrawing of the debt token now that or credit token rover now that credit token you can use in another market say usdc take some of the usdc out and then buy if again so so it still has it still has that in quotes i want to say impermanent loss but it's more like an offset loss because you can always you can always buy it back with the counter asset in the case where you got back more eve it simply burns the counter asset in the case where the if you got back is worth less you get the eve back and the counter assets so so it doesn't it doesn't negate in permanent loss anytime you do any kind of trading activity you're going to have a permanent loss but it offsets it by basically giving you an iou of the system that you can get use against something else or trade it for another um or trade it for more eve right so so so so that's that's the base layer that allows the single sided exposure and and that was y-swap and it's it's sort of standing on its own but because it uses its own custom um underlying amms it needs its own integration its own aggregators its own liquidity providers its own trader its own interface and there's just there's just so much ecosystem work to do there that that i have not had the time or capacity to do that so so that's why why swap kindness is on the back burner currently um but then a i think it was about two or three weeks ago hasu on twitter tweeted out about the possibility of having a fully decentralized lending system and that's something i've been playing with for a while but but one of your problems with this there's basically three things that mean that you can't really decentralize lending systems right now number one is what collateral do you accept as collateral right so one of the problems there is you can't just open it up to anything because otherwise i can just mint you know coin one two three i go throw that i give it an oracle price in uniswap and then i throw a billion of it into ave and i i pull out all of the i drain it so so they have to limit what collateral you put in and that's done by governance and voting it number two is the utilization ratios in other words what is the premium or the discount you're paying and the way it currently works is is it's normally dynamic so the more that gets borrowed the more interest you pay back and that's fairly traditional lending model that worked um but then i started thinking of of of tokenizing debt or rather tokenizing credit and and this idea is is it's it's no different than maker and it's no different than ava like in ave right now ave denominates everything in if so you could technically mint a a credit eth that you can then exchange for other um forever collateral that other people borrow so so by using this concept of tokenizing credit you're you're creating a credit line that allows people to borrow collateral now now stable protocol really just puts all of these concepts together right so at its baseline it does the single-sided exposure so i provide let's say usdc as collateral and then it uses that normal single-sided rule so it takes the usdc it says cool your usd you're depositing a thousand dollars worth of usdc i'm going to mint a thousand dollars of of of transfer token or whatever you want to call it and it puts it inside of the amm now this is an important part it does not give that thousand that it means to you as a user because right now the pair you're providing is actually your collateral and and we'll we'll we'll get to why that's important when we get to the trader side so what it what it does then is it calculates what is what is the the percentage contribution of this pool that you just added to the entire ecosystem worth so so so that's a a dynamic utilization calculation and it's not based on a single market it's based on the entire market as it is denominated in this transfer token so that means if the system is 99 usdt and i provide more usdt then the actual the actual credit value that i get per dollar of usdt i provide is going to be one percent so for every ten dollars i give i'm going to get one dollars worth of credit that i can actually use because the system doesn't want more usd right but you're not losing money that way because you still are able to withdraw an equal amount of tether that you deposited it's just that the credit that you receive when you do this is just capital extremely capital intensive yes but you also only have one dollar worth of debt so now if i pay back that one dollar worth of debt i get back the thousand dollars of usdc i put in so so so so so my collateral is always equivalent to the amount of debt i give but this is specifically designed so that that that 123 example you can't use to overpower the system because now i can't flood the system with this thing and drain everything else because my my capital inefficiency is going to be so big that it makes it pointless so the nice thing about that is it can you can actually add any pair so you can still add one two three assuming it has some kind of oracle that is recognized in the system um but you can't flood the system you can only do small amounts uh so so so that part handles your how much how much of the credit token you are given now this credit token i can then use to go borrow something because now i have let's say it was a more equal equivalent system and i got my max 75 so i deposited 100 usdt and i got 75 uh stable usd out of the system now i can take this 75 bucks of usd i have and i can go i can go i can go borrow in quotes what i'm actually doing is i'm selling the 75 usd d into let's say the usdc pool and i'm withdrawing an equivalent amount of usdc now this is where i commented on twitter and that's that's the only difference there was is in the reddit post it assumed it's one to one ratio but now now that would mean that you can do infinite loops um so it needs to be at a premium or a discount and this is again where the constant product market maker of uniswop is so beautiful because the more you try and withdraw the more expensive that usdc becomes so if there is only 75 usdc and i provide 75 of my debt token i'm actually only going to get like 30 usdc out of the system and that's basically the premium or the discount i'm paying so if there's a lot of usdc in the system more than the transfer token then i'll end up actually getting more so so so there's there's a nice little discount premium system built into the utilization between these different amms and as they're interacting with each other now the third part of why it's important that these are our amms and why specifically i chose uniswap as well you could do this with something like balancer etc but i prefer the the the tightness of the uniswap curve but the secondary net effect is that uniswap is integrated with a lot of existing aggregators you know you've got one inch you've got paraswap you've got matcha there's is a lot and and almost all of these systems use multi-path trading so what that means when the trader wants to do usdt to usdc he doesn't actually know it's going usdt to transfer token transfer token to usdc and e trades out so so as as borrowers and lenders are providing collateral and borrowing and repaying these pools are actually being held at price equilibrium by traders outside of the ecosystem which means if one pool gets drained a lot by a borrower who's paying a premium for that a trader can come in provide that extra collateral and trade something else out of the system and this is what keeps the collateral pools at a healthy utilization ratio without making it too expensive for borrowers because if you didn't have the traders side then then any pool that's over leveraged in terms of borrowing would become so prohibitively expensive that people don't borrow right and and while by design that's not really a problem that's actually a little bit of a good thing because it makes it expensive it does mean that it's not it's not as scalable because one of the things i needed is i needed a system that can scale beyond the current urine system because the current urine system is kind of capped in terms of where it can deploy capital because there's just too much capital and deploying more at this point doesn't doesn't increase apy it actually dilutes it for everyone else so needed a new solution in there in any case but but like like that's the whole system like it's actually just minting that stable token giving you a debt portion or a credit portion and then having the amm at the bottom so like if you actually go through the code it's like 30 lines of code it's probably the least amount of code of everything i've actually written because it just uses the this amalgamation of all of these concepts in such i think an elegant way so now the the net effects of this is you have a decentralized um lender where anyone can actually provide a collateral in a completely decentralized way and borrow against it you have a stable coin that is actually a stable coin that is equivalent to the equilibrium of the entire system and outside traders actually keep it at equilibrium and i actually think it's a slightly more more powerful stable coin because it's redeemable to one dollar equivalent of its underlying value and that redemption mechanism is incredibly important that i think a lot of a lot of protocols have been missing out and that's why they struggle to keep peg because a reason why something like usdt keeps peg is if i can buy usdt at at one percent over i'm going to do it because i can immediately redeem it for a dollar so that part is important for the stable token side and then you have the single sided exposure which from a a yield and a yearn system is very important because it means i can actually scale and another reason why why this stable protocol is nice is because it is an aggregate of all of the markets provided so if there's a link market and a usd t market and a usdc market they all compound with each other instead of actually being isolated markets so in something like the current vault strategies you know we we kept the y e vault because it was close to 70 million of die and that was just too much given the given the the exposure of the underlying protocols because it's isolated um versus if all of the vaults were in this you know it's it's it's a billion dollars of capital so all of a sudden 70 million over a billion it's it's such a tiny amount of slippage that it doesn't matter and it's actually fully deployable in this ecosystem so this this also allows for a much larger scalable funding system which i'm also very excited about um okay and i've blabbed way too much i'm sure you have questions yeah no it's great i i want to go to to dc's kind of uh his attempt to dissect uh what what's going on because he he also did a very good job uh and and um i i'm wary that a lot of people who aren't as able to keep up with the technicals are maybe a little bit lost and so um let me read this dc says i'm thinking of this as an asset collective where you deposit an asset and then you get borrowing rights up to the required collateralization ratio for that particular asset if the value of your initially deposited asset declines below the accepted collateral ratio you lose your rights to your deposit due to liquidation which in this case it could be virtual uh this creates a new single-sided amm lending service allow you to deposit any supported asset and mint a new urine debt token which is also a stable coin very much like dye and mkr when the maker model and then this debt token becomes a currency which you can use in the urine amm exchange to buy any other token any user has deposited there and so so this is like a a synthesis of a maker dow uh deposit assets receive a synthetic crypto dollar and then but it's also like uniswap because all of the deposited assets are allowed to trade between each other and so people who are interested in seeking yield can deposit their assets just just for the yield but then they also are minted uh this new uh decentralized stablecoin correct is that is all of that right so far yeah they held it okay and then and then you get this so then you deposit your ether into the new urine amm system now it's not it's not uniswap right but it is a a copy of uniswap dedicated for urine is that correct no it's clean 100 uniswap i i use unisop exactly as deployed on chain currently because they're already integrated everywhere so by using by using them i automatically get all of that volume all of that traders all of those integrators all of those aggregators which which just evens out the entire system otherwise we have to build that all ourselves and right i'm too lazy for that you're too lazy yeah okay all right um and so okay so then so then we have this this you use the uniswap contracts to put in single-sided amm liquidity which then mints a new a brand new stable coin into ethereum so one of the crazy things about this is this this is a new stable coin for ethereum that and one of the big criticisms that people have been making of maker dow lately is that you know they centralize assets um that like like usdc for example or or and you know um they they have uh companies putting like receipts in there that's kind of been on the road map for maker dao people are concerned about like the centralization of the assets in maker dao and this provides a new alternative to die like stable credit usd uh which is now this new stable coin but it's a stable coin generated out of this particular balance of assets which is uh deposited into the urine system in the same way that you can deposit many assets into compound or ave but it leverages the the liquidity of those in a particular way that leverage it with uniswap to mint this new stable usd which then you can so what what is is the point of the system to produce a new stablecoin or is that a means to an end that's just a cool side effect of course actually and and it's it's it's actually nice because it market makes itself as well because now let's say let's say you just had the stable coin part and you made the stable coin now you still need to get trading pairs for it and you still need to get people to actually list it and use it blah blah blah but this thing automates its own market so the second the first two pairs of collateral are added the stable coin has trading value and it has actual um it has actual you know spend value and and so it's also a little bit like the federal reserve model where like the federal reserve just has this balance sheet right and then it's issued dollars based on that balance sheet and that balance sheet can be you know managed and reorganized and rebalanced and redeployed and and there's flexibility around there as determined by like uh governance but in in the crypto economic defy world it's governance by i'm assuming the wifey token rather than you know no no token management so so the equilibrium between the stablecoin and the assets are actually done by the arbitrage traders right so so so as the usdc value in the system grows greater than the stablecoin value they're incentivized to trade the the stablecoin and take usdc out of the system so it's actually arbitrage traders that keep the system in equilibrium so so this protocol is designed hundred percent decentralized there's there's no there's no governance there's no token interaction there's no users making decisions this i i try to keep it as pure as uniswap it you deploy it and it just works so how do how do we determine which uh assets are approved to be a part of the system or are they all approved so right now for the poc it's it's reliant on the chain link oracle so it's anything that has a chain link price feed is accepted as collateral um for a for a v2 that i'm busy building i want to use the the uniswap's own built-in overtime oracles and do like daily measurements and then do it based off of that and by doing that it can actually accept any collateral that is available for trading in uniswap itself okay okay that makes sense so there is actually no any connection to the wi-fi token or urine finance except for the fact that yearn may be a very strong customer of this new uh protocol is that correct yeah your urine can use this to actually scale near infinitely with its faults right so right now we're basically capital capped we can't actually deploy much more and this will allow us to just you know 10x those numbers right right and so this i mean assuming this solution came out of the problem of like we had to you had to close down the the y ethanol because it was so popular but there was just too much capital because there was so much demand and and having that um limited by dye because die was too much of a proportion of the capital of urine is that correct and so you could create this thing so i'm i've been working on this constant for much longer than that it just happened to time up as a very elegant solution um so so i mean i i i'd like to say you know i i started thinking of this two weeks ago and now it's done um i've sadly i'm i'm not that good um i've been this this is a bunch of concepts i've been working on for a very long time that just finally fit together um i i did only make the breakthrough in terms of how these components work together when i ran into that problem though but like each of these sub components is stuff i've been working on and building on since since late last year fantastic fantastic okay so let's talk about timeline so at the end of this article you said you are currently finalizing the ui and we'll make it available in the coming weeks so it sounds like the code of of this is done like you've been working on it in the background so now now it's just a matter of getting something up and running so people can actually look at it and interact with it yeah so the the core smart contracts are deployed the helper smart contracts are deployed um we're not just tying up a ui that makes logical sense for a user um so that they can see you know how much collateral do they have how much can they borrow if they were to borrow how much would they actually get out you know like in quotes what's the slippage it's actually the utilization ratios but anyway so just putting all of that together and then people can start playing with it but i do want to i do want to stress there's there's no there's no benefit to an early mover advantage here so you know there's no need to rush in there's no need to start using it like just chill because i know people have a tendency to to fomo into as soon as we release stuff there's there's zero benefit there's just risk so you know just chill when we open it up right and this isn't a yield farming thing there isn't a token to be farmed this is just a protocol that can offer new services correct i mean one of the one of the appealing things is obviously the more capital that's in there then people can start leveraging themselves because that is what you do with credit um so so that's sort of the that's that's the that's the attraction part that's why you provide collateral because on the one hand you get trade fees which is obviously awesome but on the other hand you get credit that you can use to buy something else or exit or leverage or all of the usual stuff you do with die at this point right so so those are the value adds for the users of the system aside of it being a a decentralized lending protocol which in itself is cool uh but yeah there's there's there's not gonna be any  thousand percent api or or special new token or any of that stuff so you know just just chill and let the protocol age a little bit before you you start horribly abusing her let it let it steep in d5 first all right andre thank you so much any uh last messages yet you want to give out to the bankless nation um i'll probably see you guys again in a few weeks it seems like i'm i'm going to start becoming a regular i i hope so i'd love to hear it that's awesome thanks for the time bye andre thank you
