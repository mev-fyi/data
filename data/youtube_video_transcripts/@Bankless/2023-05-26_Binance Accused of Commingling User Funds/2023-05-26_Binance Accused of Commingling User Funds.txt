Finance accused of co-mingling customer funds I'm sure CZ would call this fud gler station it is the fourth Friday of May the last Friday of May David what time is it it's the bankers Friday weekly roll-up where we covered the entire Weekly News in crypto which is actually not that ambitious this week I would actually call this a slow week which really I don't think I've ever said that we can use slow weekend news yeah yeah that's why we have some weird takes in the take Section yeah that's why they take State yeah I it's a sleepy Market maybe I'm gonna call this the Boar market before is that is that what we're in for the more the bore Market yeah it's gonna be a boring roll-up David no it's going to be extremely exciting stay tuned for every single second of it and don't go away let's talk about the topics of the week so continuation of Ledger Ledger recover they're actually capitulating on that they're postponing it so we'll talk about that what else we got a dcg has missed its payment deadline to its own subsidiary Genesis so we'll talk about what that means yeah they're not paying themselves they did they failed to pay themselves 630 million dollars so what is the Fallout of that we will we will cover that as well um tornado cap did you hear about this right tornado cash Got Hijacked uh I did a governance attack over tornado cash uh it's kind of funny just because like it's tornado cash so like it's gotten hijacked from the nation state and now also two people are hijacking it uh and then what else what else are we gonna talk about we got this uh fed report that came out okay the Federal Reserve did you know one in 10 Americans use cryptocurrency who's telling us that the FED we got to get into this report is there's a ton of really cool stats coming out of that and also binance was accused this week week of commingling customer funds and Company Revenue got some more info on dokwan as well and some of the bad boys of crypto finishing that up so look man it's still it's still a good roll up yeah it's still also be my last roll up here in Montenegro right this will be the very last one are you gonna miss it so long Montenegro so long Montenegro yeah uh I will I miss it I have well my experience here has been great I want to go home we've been uh away from your home for like months now right eight weeks eight weeks that's the longest April isn't home since College I only measure time in Roll-Ups yeah there's 52 Roll-Ups a year David's been gone in Montenegro for eight roll-ups are you coming home the next roll up in New York City that's uh very exciting you're gonna be some good old brick in the background anyways uh gotta talk to our friends and sponsors at consensus who want to let you know that there is this new tool out on The Malt Market called diligence fuzzing to level up your smart contract security uh so this is a tool in addition to your regular security object audits uh fuzzing is a tool that developers who this ad is targeted towards would probably already know about you throw a bunch of numbers at your parameters and if any uh number comes back and it's a bad number diligence fuzzing from consensus will figure that out for you so there is a link in the show notes to go get your contracts buzzed David I'm I'm sure all the devs really enjoyed that super technical description of what because they totally need it but do you know what it was not inaccurate I think that's exactly what fuzzing actually is and this is a free tool from consensus I hope more solidity devs take fuzzing seriously because uh we it's a very serious subject yeah we can't have more smart contract hacks okay not in 2023 D5 can't take another hit like this we've been down bad guys let's fuzz all our contracts so this doesn't happen all right uh get to the markets shall we okay bitcoin price on the week what are we looking at uh we can count it and that is not a flat week if we really want to um Bitcoin is down one percent better than flat start of the week at 26 600 any of the week at 26 300. 26 that okay I'm below 30k still feels bearish to me just like below 2K eth still feels bearish season and this was um Bitcoin Miami was last week yes was it wait was it last week or did it just finish this week it was last weekend yeah this is a time to really rally the troops isn't it I mean haven't we seen previously Bitcoin Miami weeks a little bit of a a push-up a little bit of a spike or is that just all chart noise am I making things up I think last year it dumped yeah a conferences tend to dump in East conferences Bitcoin conferences I I it's about people get together and they get like they're like oh man this is who I'm surrounded with no no we just we just throw super dumb exorbitant parties and we have to sell our assets to pay for them oh you think that's it I don't know all these events that all the VCS throw yeah well it's interesting Bitcoin Miami I um didn't hear much about it the only thing I heard was kind of the the contention and the conflict between the ordinals the tapri Wizards uh or something in the the laser eyes which is is sort of the sub-tribes of this if you're in Bitcoin or circles we had some but I think that's also mostly online too yeah I think that's totally on my actual conference yeah it was there was no the the things I heard from the Bitcoin conference was that uh Eric wall and Udi wertheimer is going up against the Cyber Hornets which was mostly an online phenomenon and then also Ron desantis's uh no ah no uh not Rhonda santis um uh who yeah okay and yeah we're going to talk about Ron DeSantis a little bit later it seems like there's a little bit of red versus blue on the uh the crypto thing it's becoming more partisan but that's not in the market section all right Heath price sadly I would count this as flat we started the week at 18 and 10 18 10 ending the week at 17.50 we're down point eight percent okay sorry Ryan it's flat ratio time ratio time is that flat too it's up a little bit up a time a little bit you know what any flat week I'm Gonna Be Sad from now on because I just like so boring yes make up your mind Market we're going up or down stop with this tepid do something I'm bored I can't stand it spew it out of my mouth um thank you but okay something that is still up only is eat staking uh oh so Lido had now now that Lido the largest uh decentralization service protocol uh has withdrawn enabled withdrawals we are able to see the final uh org of e-saking open up escape to withdraw and so now this is like complete there's no one left to enable withdrawals yet we are at all-time high of safety 21 million we crossed 20 million States this uh this last week uh so the acceleration of further eat steak into the beacon chain uh continues let's continue to accelerate there really in ether not two million dollars of there are two million ether units waiting to get uh into the beacon change in the validation queue the it would take you Ryan if you deposited 32 ether to get to be a Staker it would take you almost 1 000 hours I don't even know how many days that is 967 hours to get into the beacon chain how many Roll-Ups is that 967 about four Roll-Ups because these things are forever because wow yeah 40 days it would take you 40 days to get into the beacon train that's a long time I mean 40 days that's a that's a lifetime almost yeah it'll take you two minutes to exit so high people getting in they just wait I guess they have to be patient or you could just buy steak I bet you there's a premium on steak teeth right now when does it stop David we're gonna go from 20 to 22 to 25 to 30 million tough that's what it stops and this was Justin Drake said recently he's like I think it'll probably be like 30 million ish if we stop you know plus or minus 15 something like that is very strong the fact that we are like doubling the rate of growth post withdrawals is awesome sorry it's gonna stop this is not an up only chart though there is some equilibrium this is some equilibrium that that will be reached um and uh yeah I mean we don't want to see this chart go up only but for now it's good good news for now uh you know we skipped a number David crypto market cap 1.15 trillion there I said it for completeness uh what chart are we looking at with Lido yeah so this is Lido withdrawals after one week okay so a whopping 450 000 ether got withdrawn from Lido and I'm saying lopping jokingly because uh do you know how much ether's actually in lighter um of 20 million 21 million ether I'm going to say what slido have like 30 of that something close yeah you're on target seven million something like this wow nice job 6.7 million is how much ether is it deposition so 530 excuse me 470 000 ether got withdrawn 430 000 of that was Celsius 40 000 ether was withdrawn just by like General users oh Celsius I remember those guys what are they doing with it paying down some uh debts there I think yeah I think they're refunding some depositors yeah they're liquidating it yeah so uh Lido I would say has held up in terms of the snow globe effect I mean yeah they're lost they lost half a million ether of their 6.6 million and most of that was Celsius took the largest share of 7 700 ether not that much uh yeah not that much what so what what is happening with all the this light out it's not being restaked is just going back to kind of Celsius I'm assuming whoever is doing the Celsius bankruptcy is liquidating The Ether they're selling it for dollars right yeah I I don't assume I I'm by the way some of this eth is probably mine tiny fraction yeah I love Banks I love them um looking forward to never getting that back yeah okay they're gonna sell your ether for you and give you back uscc I mean to be fair though to Celsius this is probably the best the most rational place they actually stored their eat yeah because they put it in all sorts of other yeah they bought they bought a Bitcoin mining operation it was the stupidest thing to do with customer funds oh man those were the days I hope we never do that again like crypto in general knock on wood please okay um let's talk about the bigger picture markets all right because the r word that is recession was bandied about this week in Germany a German uh economy entered recession as inflation hurts consumers that is the title here so the German economy is officially in recession Under The Economist definition of that word which is multiple quarters of negative GDP so we're there yet we're there already in Germany I get is this only a matter of time before recession sweeps through other areas of Europe comes to the United States uh do you have any takes on that David I well I think the people paying attention to macro all understood that recession is coming globally it's just a matter of how fast and how hard and for how long um the idea of being announced that we are entering a recession kind of just seems illogical it's like don't market downturn like I get buy we need a we need an arbitrary definition of what a recession is so in order to be able to announce that we are in one um but yes we are having entering a phase of slower growth well there we are slower growth and this is not just slower growth it's negative growth that is the uh Economist definition of recession right meanwhile this to me was the chart of the week this is uh from Genevieve uh a chart on buying versus renting in America and there's two lines on this chart all the way from the 1970s this uh yellow line is the cost to buy in terms of monthly fees how much does it cost if you are in a house let's say or in an apartment and you own that piece of property versus the cost to rent that is this blue I guess turquoise type line here and it's interesting how the kind of the the lines are sort of correlated in that they they go up together but there are these periods of time where the cost to buy far outstrips the cost to rent and I think these periods of time sort of resemble um bubbles housing price bubbles for example so we we see this one in uh 2006 that's where the yellow line shoots far above the blue line so the cost uh to buy is much more expensive than the cost to rent now look at things today David right and this happens since covid we've got a yellow line that has far outstripped the uh the blue line that means the cost to buy right now um 2 700 per month is um the average cost is per per month for a mortgage versus the cost to rent is one thousand eight hundred and fifty why is this happening I mean to me this just looks like asset price inflation particularly in the housing market particularly in the property market and I know this is hitting uh younger people disproportionately people are in their 20s in their early 30s never purchased any property never bought a home and they're like I never will be able to do this thing and you're asking for 10 down 20 down in order for me to also buy this property I can't afford it I'm just going to be renting for the rest of my life that's how it seems to many people in the economy and I think this has a psychological impact too do you have any thoughts on this chart yeah it's hard for podcast listeners I think really appreciate this visual the so like the cost to buy line deviated away from the cost of rent line like three times in this chart once in the 1980s during the mortgage rate inflation of the early 1980s the second time in the housing bubble of 2006 and now a third time and it's third time is the most recent time where we are now is like three times higher than the other two bubbles the other two bubbles are about the same size this one's still like three times higher the other thing that's important to know is that even though this cost to buy is accelerating Way Beyond the cost of rent the cost of rent is also at an accelerating rate too both are up and so it just is a graph of like man the cost of living sucks right now it is hard to be alive being alive is expensive it's getting more and more expensive and wages aren't uh Rising it commensurate it's as well also this week David one of the most interesting reports I've seen in a while came out and you actually put this to the agenda so why don't you introduce this did you know bankless listener that one in 10 Americans uses cryptocurrency either holds or transacts in cryptocurrency was that report put out by coinbase by Kraken by um I don't know the ethereum foundation no the Federal Reserve this is a report from the Federal Reserve David what are we looking at here yeah so we're looking at a graph of just different metrics and and stats about the American population and their relationship with crypto so here are some important stats uh in 2021 this used to be 12 12 of people use crypto in any single way in 20 uh in 2023 now we are down or 2022 we're down to 10 so we lost two percent of all Americans which actually is not so bad like in the bear market like we got most people are sticking around uh and then there was another poll why are people using crypto uh 21 both said to send money faster and also because the business or person preferred it twenty percent of people said because of privacy uh some other interesting stats of white U.S citizens actually are the least likely to be crypto users uh so black Hispanic Asian all coming in with much stronger numbers than white people which is interesting males use crypto twice as much as females uh no that's not a surprise whatsoever but I think the punchline is really what you said uh one in ten one in ten Americans that's actually huge and by the way when they track usage this was surprising to me so um as you would expect the predominant use case is bought or held as an investment and that was 11 in 2021 it's eight percent now so that's decreased um but the other use case is used to buy something or make a payment that's two percent not insignificant two percent of Americans are using this to buy or make a payment or sending money to friends or family and that has not decreased in 2022 which is very interesting but if you're the fed and you're looking at these numbers David and you're like oh interesting by the way this report was not a report on crypto the report is economic well-being of U.S House households in 2022 and they have to include crypto now why because it's tied into economic well-being it's tied into payments it's tied into assets and if you're the fed and you're you're looking at this report you're looking at the numbers you're like oh wow 10 1 in 10 Americans are using crypto dough this is no longer an insignificant portion of the population that is using an alternative to the banking system that you set up and propagate no wonder this is starting to enter National discourse and political discourse like it's an important issue when you have 10 of Americans using something other than the U.S banking system I think the banks of which the most prominent is the fed the central Banker of central Bankers have to take notice and that's what they're doing here and there's also important to note the investment use case is outstripping the utility use case and that's natural right the reason why there's more investors is because investors try and predict the future and so actual utility of these things is going to lag investors here in Montenegro in this like crypto community that I've been living with in the last two years there's a people from Africa crypto people from Africa and the users of crypto in Africa like two percent America no no no like twenty thirty percent are you kidding me yeah yeah yeah yeah uh and so it makes sense like in crypto we're well financialized and well banked that like oh yeah only two percent but like uh entire continents where we don't really consider like talk about like we don't talk about utility in Africa because it's not like in in the moment of crypto Twitter like crypto Twitter doesn't really care about that but like utility is off the charts uh and usage is off the charts uh and so only in America I think do you see investors um actually like tripling the rate of actual users and you can actually see this in the stats so and by the way David did you know that bankless is the number one podcast in Tunisia right now number one business and investing podcast or number one is number one business in investing it might be across all categories too now it's probably not across all categories it's probably too much like number one in business and investing um I mean Bagless has a pretty uh a pretty cool African Community right now and there's you know some uh there's like a bankless Africa that's really like taking this over so that is amazing to see I mean that is at the end of the day why we're here be really interesting to see a similar economic well-being report uh in other Emerging Market areas as well and what the percentages look like there I haven't seen that yet Brian Armstrong had a take about this report uh and this is this report is coming in during the lack of scalability in the in the crypto ecosystem and so he tweets out uh early days once Layer Two really gets going it will be going like from dial-up to broadband uh so imagine how much utility we can get when we can get people onto a low fee environment it's a great take great take something else that I feel like is a bullish for crypto is this whole AI thing but um before before we get to that story can you tell us about Nvidia share Spike 26 on huge forecast beat driven by AI chip demand why'd you pull this into the market section today David well mainly because it's a slow week in crypto Rand but also I thought this was particularly interesting anyways uh okay so Nvidia reports 4.3 billion in sales versus expected 3.9 uh where did that come from it come from demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as a very large consumer internet companies which you like to use in Nvidia trips to chain and deploy deploy generative AI applications like open ai's chat GPT so okay so AI is starting to impact equities the demand for AI growth of AI specifically Nvidia the other important thing Ron I think that was useful and the kind of the punchline of this thing the market cap of Nvidia as a company went from 755 billion to 973 billion in just in one day this last yesterday basically a trillion dollar market cap it grew one ethereum in market cap that's incredible one ethereum one if you're having about 220 billion dollars or something like that that's what ethereum is right now yeah and it's which is so dumb because like all of these AI things that like Nvidia is going to help train and all the Open chat gbt like what money do you think these companies these AI Bots are going to use they're gonna it's gonna use ether well I I think I think that's what the opportunity is here right so like um Nvidia sells gpus and of course AI models are massive consumers of gpus by the way is the gamer Community upset about this no they are mad at crypto mining for a while because we were like the poor Gamers first like all the ethereum miners suck up all their chips finally ethereum went to proof of stake it's been it's been five eight years since I've been able to get a GPU and then all of a sudden we have this AI Revolution it's like oh no this is gonna be way more profitable than your game oh poor Gamers well I think the tie-in here with crypto is um blogspace really hasn't had its AI demand moment yeah all right gpus have we're starting to see it here and look at this a 26 increase in ethereum a 200 billion dollar increase in uh real world stock price as a result I think what's the AI start to demand block space we're going to see something similar and we're well still ways ahead of that I feel like we're maybe a couple of years did that but um I think that is coming as well and it will mirror what we're seeing in gpus David what do we have have coming up next coming up next Ledger postpones it's recover product why how why did that happen we'll talk about that and also base coming to mainnet tornado cash hijacked binance accused of commingling funds Apple being friendly lots of more news to talk about in this week but first moments to talk about these

recover products so why do they do this they heard all the community backlash they say in this announcement will release Ledger recover product as soon as this firmware part of the code will be published so this is a way for people to actually verify the firmware before people install it onto the ledger to make sure that it only does the things that it will say that it does when people install it uh interesting take interesting response uh Ryan uh what do you think about this I mean my question is Happy Ending question mark I guess is this kind of a happy ending so um if you guys missed the last two weeks of this there's been this massive controversy over this product that ledger added called Ledger recover that essentially enables with your permission you have to click some buttons on your Ledger but it enables the firmware with a ledger software update and an opt-in service called recover allows them to basically take out your seed phrase send it to multiple parties and store it there so that recover users Legend recover users which again is an opt-in service but it you know still can be activated allows quicker recovery and so of course like hardcore crypto users anyone who cares very deeply about self-sovereignty and keeping their their private keys and the the thing that they were sold in the hardware wallet was very concerned about that it's like what this company can actually extract the seed phrase my private keys outside of the hardware wallet like isn't this the purpose of the hardware wallet and now so here's Ledger there was massive controversy last week and it spilled certainly uh over into this week now here's Ledger coming out and saying hey we're just going to delay that feature like we got it wrong and they're also saying that they're going to open source most of their operating system starting with Ledger recover to make it fully auditable I hope they open source the firmware as well or as much of that as possible I think this pressure the reason I said um Happy ending question mark is because it seems like this pressure is actually increasing the um motivation for ledger to open source elements of its Tech stack and I think that additional transparency and accountability is only a good thing for crypto and for this space without this controversy would that have happened I mean probably not so maybe this is turning into a happy ending here what do you think about that take yeah what I learned from having Charles the CTO of Ledger on the podcast is that really there is no other way to have maximum the the assurances that the crypto industry wants from his Hardware wallets you can't have that unless all of the updates and all the software part of the hardware wallet are open source and verifiable by the public without that there's always going to be some trust and The Ledger has always has stated that this has always been a part of their roadmap so this actually technically isn't new um there the new thing is that they are saying that they are accelerating this and they are also not releasing their recover product until they have completed some open source Milestones as well so that's the news I think that's good um all right David we got dcg missing a payment to themselves I think digital currency group of course what is uh what is what's going on what happened this week and why is this uh this subject relevant so this goes back to the Genesis Gemini earn Grace grayscale and dcg like mess uh and so Genesis had a balance Holiness balance sheet because it had a bunch of money lent out to three arrows Capital who got liquidated and then that's led to the insolvency or the inability for Gemini earned customers to get their money back uh dcg filled the hole in genesis's balance sheet by just writing them a loan and so dcg but dcg needs needed to make a payment to Genesis a 630 million dollar loan to Genesis to fill the hole in the balance sheet dcg did not pay that when that came due last week and so what does this mean this is ultimately going to would be the money to go and pay back Gemini earned customers and anyone else who is a creditor of Genesis uh and so Gemini this is why this is a post on Gemini's website because this would also otherwise be their money there's a handful of groups the unsecured creditors committee the ad hoc group of creditors in Gemini are considering whether to provide forbearance to dcg to avoid a dcg default forbearance I had to look this up special agreement between a lender and a borrower to delay a foreclosure uh and so uh that is kind of the news this week uh overall um I kind of was going through this news Ryan I was like okay other than like uh Gemini earned customers who are waiting to get their money back what does this have to do with like how's this going to impact the crypto markets and I'm kind of like meh yeah I mean I feel like all of this is known like we we know that dcg is not in good shape uh we already know there's there's not really new information here is this like some kind of slow motion bankruptcy of dcg this is some sort of slow motion insolvency know what's going on that was kind of my base prediction though right like I think that's what people expected would happen guess what David I had some money and Gem and I earned as well because you love Banks again not very much bankless listeners but uh I tried all of the things at one point in time and I think that's the big question is there's something like 800 million dollars 900 million dollars was in in Gemini earn and this is retail money primarily and the the the folks who have that money had that money in Gemini Aaron are just wondering whether they're going to get it back and I don't think that this story provides any closure to them it's certainly not comforting to know that dcg didn't pay another 630 million dollars on the scheduled time so not great news from that perspective yeah so if you guys want to dive down into this detail a little bit more ROM uh former bank close podcast guys we've had one recently twice now I put a great Twitter thread together I'll summarize it pretty quickly um basically he says dcg Needs forbearance they missed the 630 million dollars in payments dcg does have great assets but they have a financing problem bills are due today but the cash flow that they have comes over the next few years also there's this additional pressure coming from the inevitability of a Bitcoin ETF a Bitcoin ETF will come whether Gary Gensler approves one maybe not but the next chair will at some point in time there will be a Bitcoin ETF and that will really reduce all of grayscales the main cash cow of d ccg their ability to take fees because they grayscale is charging 200 bips where an effective ETF from some Market competitive thing would more likely be through 30 bips and so fees going into grayscale would basically go to zero and so that's great scales or that's uh dcg's last remaining big asset and the ROM said he's done a bit of the math there's just not enough time for grayscale to generate cash to pay off the 1.7 billion dollars of debt that dcg 1.7 billion yes it's a lot David yes yeah and so the idea here is grayscale is a cash cow that time is running short as soon as there's a Bitcoin ETF uh then the fees are just not gonna not gonna cut it and so dcg is like time is not on dcg side here I feel like everyone's just hoping for another crypto bull market to just paper these things mistakes right if Bitcoin goes to uh 100K then like you know doesn't matter dcg can afford this uh all right what do we got tornado cash what's happened what does that even mean uh okay so a malicious Dao tornado Dao governance proposal was proposed uh and then that malicious proposal actually got 700 000 votes because there was a sneaky part of that proposal that was not no one taught no one saw the potential exploit a potential bug and so this proposer uh got this uh proposal to go through which ultimately allowed a malicious exploiter through governance uh control allowed the attacker to basically take over the Tao wait what's the proposer of this governance proposal proposal was that the hacker that one sells uh okay I would imagine so yes yes the malicious governance proposal I'm assuming um yeah so they the the uh Governor's proposal allowed the attacker to Grant themselves 1.2 million fake votes after it got uh 0.7 million legit votes and then so what does that mean recap recap on tornado cash okay so it is a privacy protocol of course that U.S citizens cannot use thank you ofac but it's a privacy protocol kind of a mixer you put your Ethan if you want to sort of anonymize it and you can get it out and of course we've talked about this a lot but there's a governance component to this protocol and there's a token called Torn t-o-r-n that is the the governance token behind this critical is that the part that was hacked the governance protocol itself not the smart contracts with all of the the mixed ethernet uh am I correct about this that is correct yes so the actual pools are not affected because they are completely like cut off from uh exploitation by the governance tornado cash governance has no governance over the pools they are their own like self-sovereign contracts on ethereum uh and so the individual pools are intact so what the attacker can do is with uh draw all the locked votes and drain all the tokens in the governance contracts so there's uh some funds Treasury funds and then also some torn tokens and so those got exploited now basically the torn token is going to zero uh and uh that's basically the story I mean I mean it does this kill tornado cash yes it well so the one of the functions of tornado cash governance was the relayers which is how people actually achieved privacy so like when you withdrew your ether from tornado cash you need to process that as a transaction who pays for the gas fees if you pay for the gas fees then you actually just docks yourself again so it makes it pointless so a relayer would right process that transaction for you and that was about governance I think um yeah anyways governance over tornado crash is dead pools are still intact uh tpd on really what happens next I mean it's not but it's and who was the attacker it's like the CIA attacking it I mean there's reports that this was um the North Korean group um were they called again Lazarus why would they attack tornado cash though because they love tornado cash who knows what's going on yeah psyops it's an interesting case study in exploitative governance attacks which is a thing that we went on a business and now Purity hole isn't it right right but I mean it's also why like but we did know that tornado cash privacy pools are were cut off from this and so we that's been the way that they've been designed other systems like this are designed like uniswap governance if Unison governance got exploited there this funds in USA would be completely safe because of the same principle yeah but it does some funky things like it sort of I I don't know you can't govern the thing anymore you can't upgrade it yeah all sorts of bad things happened so I mean it's especially weird when like tornado cash Governor's philosophy was supposed to be very and is very very separate from the afro product same thing with uniswap so like uh governance got exploited oh no oh no we can't cover no cash anymore this oh all the torrent systems maximally ungovernable I I think what's what's uh really fascinating about this is that's a story but it's like who is the attacker um the identity of the attack and what the motivations are there um this is one of the most interesting set of smart contracts on ethereum given kind of the the geopolitical um confrontation about it so only only set of smart contracts in the ofax sanction list um all right Finance accused of co-mingling customer funds so mixing customer funds and Company Revenue together that's a story that came out of Reuters this week a special report um I'm sure CZ would call this fud David but what are the details of this story so the accusation the details are that binance co-main gold customer funds and also profits and Company money into the same accounts interestingly at silvergate bank I do not know binance had an account at silvergate this is before it collapsed of course uh so customer dollars flowed into silvergate and then also profits and also customer uh company money also floated into the same account at silvergate so big accounting no no um best case scenario is that it's just a big accounting No-No I mean I think they're one of the reasons why this is news is like the last time that we saw co-mingled customer funds it was FTX because yeah and the last uh founder CEOs said oh that's just fun as well remember that guy his name is SPF yeah so if you look into the story you'll see like customer flows of customer funds flowed into silvergate and then that went into a firm initialis called key Vision which was controlled by binance uh by CZ uh but basically this is this is the story co-mingle customer funds uh they found no evidence that client money was taken um but the idea is like in the FTX story is like yeah customers funny my money wasn't like taken or stolen they was just liquidated because they were trading so no one really knows and now it's a black box and so it doesn't really do anything to help The Narrative of binance as a big black box it certainly doesn't it's more of a black box I hate that we're in the position of like we have to actually kind of trust CZ right um and of course uh CZ is saying four to this right it's more fun right it's basically and if you don't know what four means uh we actually recorded an episode with CZ where he kind of explains that um that's coming out Monday and you could get his takes on on this and some other things but I guess what what do we know um Finance is still standing yep after the the 2022 and 2023 Bank runs all right so they didn't go under um they processed 17 billion dollars of withdrawals in the week that people tried to do the run on binance right so they may be doing something we have no idea I have no idea they weren't doing it to the extent that sambach been freed was and FDX was right I um I do wish we had better proof of reserves uh in place and that's a question we asked uh CZ he kind of um said that wasn't the full answer but like we need better proof of reserves for uh the crypto exchanges we need better audits we need better records um I don't I don't know how much you can trust a binance I mean my answer to this is you got to use multiple crypto exchanges that's that's always the way and you don't keep your funds on a crypto exchange guys right public bathroom go in do your business get out that's what you should be doing and so you're not put in this place of having to trust a crypto bank at least at an individual level at the same time David um I don't know if all of the the critics are right on binance like um there there is this notion that that binance and CZ are just as corrupt as another SBF I'm certainly that's a popular notion in the U.S um but then we have operation choke point how difficult is it to actually get a bank account in the United States maybe there are some reasons not necessarily for commingly funds that's probably always unjustifiable but maybe there are some reasons that um the back end looks messy it's because it's very difficult to come into the light and actually get a regulated bank account in the United States so I don't really know who to trust in this situation and I hate that we are in this position in crypto and there's certainly some blame on the uh CZ side the finance side of things to go around but there's absolutely some blame on the U.S regulatory apparatus side and they haven't made this easy they've just pushed more into the dark I mean we have wells notices going to coinbase who has been domiciled in the U.S from the very beginning and has been kind of the student at the front of the class straight A student always saying yes teacher I'll do that whatever you need like being very regulatory compliant and they are having trouble with the current Administration the current regulatory apparatus in the U.S if they can't do it I mean we got a real problem so that's my take it it's not necessarily satisfying right now because I don't know who to trust and who not there's there's not sort of a very clear binary about this but that's all I got what do you think yeah I mean by we talked about this in the podcast like binance and tether are these two very large systemic components of the crypto industry that are just flood magnets everyone wants to flood them and like anytime I see like the next tether fun uh scroll across my like Twitter feed I just keep on scrolling because like it's been that way ever since I've gotten to crypto there's always been tetherfud and now it's starting to be like oh now there's is binance fund binance and like the only reason why I know to scroll past tetherfud is because like it's always happened and nothing's ever come to pass and is starting to be that way with binance 2 but it's only the only reason why that's I keep on scrolling is because every other time it's always passed that's the only reason I've got not that I know anything it's just like oh let me ask you why it came to be do you trust tether enough to store your staple coins in tether or do you choose a different staplecoin I don't I've never held tether for like more than a day or whatever and why is that is it because you don't trust them the extent you trust other stable coins there's better options yeah that's how that's the way I've always felt that's also the way I I feel about um centralized exchange choices right and I I think there's still where we are in this in this industry in this stage uh is to be a crypto user you are in the Wild West in The Journey West you can't trust anybody you have to like be educated about this stuff and you have to make Discerning choices so if it smells bad even if it's not entirely bad you don't know just don't put your eggs in that basket or just only put a few eggs in that basket um speaking as a former Celsius user you know and I I had like very little in that right and it was just a kind of test and very intentionally so because bad stuff can happen in crypto I mean fine it's fun week all right moving coming up next in the rest of the news base on mainnet soon TM pudgy Penguins on Amazon got toys nft toys on Amazon actually following through with this roadmap that's pretty cool and then also could restaking mess up ethereum uh new vitalik article just drops about his concerns about restaking which Ryan and I will unpack so all of that news and more but first of all we want to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible especially metamask if we have used any weird jargon that is uh esoteric and Niche and needs explaining and we forgot to explain it then metamask learn is for you let's go hear from them learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto metamask learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand giving you actual practical experience for navigating web3 the purpose of metamask learn is to teach people the basics of self-custody and wallet Security in a safe environment and while metamask learn always takes the time to Define web 3 specific vocabulary it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto curious user friendly not scary metamask learn is available in 10 languages with more to be added soon and it's meant to cater to a global web3 audience so are you tired of having to explain crypto Concepts to your friends go to learn.menimask.io and add metamask learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web 3. mantle is a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 Network built differently from the other layer twos you may be familiar with mantle is a modular layer 2 built on the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce Mantle's gas fees by 80 compared to other layer twos but it also reduces gas fee volatility mantle has a decentralized sequencer set eliminating the risk of downtime and censorship on the Network and because mantle implements multi-party computation nodes layer 1 settlement execution is shortened from seven days to as low as just one or two mantle is the first layer two built by a dow and is backed by one of the biggest Dow treasuries in the world bit down mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded to help the growth of mantle like game 7 for web 3 gaming or edu Dao for the world of Desai and buy bit for tvl liquidity and on-ramps check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle Apple the web 2 Mafia starting to actually give some green light to some crypto apps so we got two reports out of but one out of step in and one out of axi infinity that they're in app crypto features that involve trading or buying or selling of crypto assets got approved and are not paying the 30 fee wow that's pretty cool I wonder if they had to Kiss the Ring to the mob boss I I don't know so stepan announced the integration of Apple pay as the first blockchain game users can buy sell and trade step in nft sneakers in the app and pay for them with debit and credit cards linked to Apple pay and so you can purchase spark credits which I think is an internal currency to step in and then spark credits is one usdc and so usdc is in this app that is approved by Apple uh and so that and then also similarly axi Infinity has also gotten its approved finally after years of them trying this axi Infinity game Launches on the Apple App Store in key markets uh I guess maybe there's a thawing going on in the cold war between crypto web 3 and apple least hints of this I I hope it continues Apple has been a massive gatekeeper I mean uniswap the wallet couldn't even get approved for the longest of times yeah uh this seems like good news to me yeah I mean the Apple's got a lot of users it would it makes absolutely zero sense for them to charge 30 on every single blockchain integration and so it was either no blockchain at all in the app in the Apple iOS store ever or are they let loose and so finally maybe there's Attorney At The Tides maybe I'd like to see more of that before uh we can say it's a trend but good science base mainnet coinbase's base layer two built on the op stack is coming to mainnet soon TM uh there is a set of criteria that will unlock the mainnet launch a successful hard Fork of their test net another successful infrastructure review with OP Labs uh op mainnet must upgrade to bedrock which is also soon TM we talked about that last week and then completion of audits with no critical issues and some test and stability most all these things happen then we're going to see the base mainnet launch and the test has been up and running and so all of these applications I have been building on the test net are just they're just gonna be ready to go so the theme park that is being built is going to have rides on day one and let's just remind bankless listeners as well this is the first time a major centralized exchange has launched a layer two the very very first time history being made here I think we even asked CZ about that hey CZ you're going to turn the bnbj into a roll-up you know you remember what he said well no no we should tease it the answer guys is coming on Monday when we release the podcast he I'm gonna tease it he did say uh the BNB team has thought about layer twos on binance chain I'm like that's not what I asked easy well you can hear that answer uh coming up on Monday David some cool stuff in the nft world at least I think so pudgy Penguins smashes their Amazon debut are we looking at a commercial here for pudgy penguin toys yeah poetry penguin um stuffed animals Ted is it worth playing teddy bears but Teddy Penguins kind of weird Julie it's time to go oh that's them on the floor this big Toy Story looking commercial right now oh it is oh they're waking up I'm alive so cute all right hangers clear my back was starting to okay this is a Toy Story ripoff does anyone see my hat what's that sound we don't have to watch more dude do you have a penguin I'm curious tired everyone kid's coming back no she only took one of the nfts clearly she's got a favorite ghost is clear it's the highest uh ice market value all right well here's here are the stats 500 000 of pudgy penguin stuffed animals were sold in the first week in the first two days that seems good that seems like yeah that's that's because like nft market caps aren't that high they're in the tens of millions of dollars maybe maybe Penguins over 100 I don't know um 20 000 individual stuffed animal pedri penguins were sold dominated the charts of Amazon sales beating Brands like Disney Transformers Pokemon Barbie and Legos uh pretty crazy yeah that's who's buying all these things is it kids are we turning kids or is it us uh oh I don't know what's more concerning I guess uh stuffed animals there's nothing wrong with stuffed animals if you're you know a grown adult 20 000 individual toy sold well there's only 10 000 Pudgies so even if every single nft owner bought two that's that's that's how that would come out to be all right congrats to the pubg team for executing on the roadmap in that shop yeah um it'd be pretty crazy to see like a new toy enter the children's world and it actually started as like a degenerate nft part project in the bull market crazy but not like that wouldn't surprise me at all yeah I mean there's something that would okay yeah that's that's seems about right I could totally see that happening uh okay all right moving on uh dokwan our favorite person who's just down the street from me in Montenegro uh is back in jail his bail got revoked he was on yeah he was freed on bail for her like a really low number like 450 000 and then a judge has revoked that and now he's back in Montenegro in jail that's the story okay uh sorry though no interview on Bank interview yeah uh David did you read this article uh it's entitled don't overload ethereum's consensus from vitalik buterin and he was really talking about restaking here which has been a theme we've been talking about a lot on bankless and I think the subtext of this theme these are not the words vitalik use but it's basically could restaking hurt ethereum could it kill ethereum could it really damage the protocol and what's kind of your tldr of his post of course your vitalik does a great job putting it in his own words but if you were to kind of synthesize this for us what would you say he's trying to communicate in this post so just to briefly explain restaking restaking is when you take your eat steak you are staked you have staked your eats to the ethereum main chain restaking allows you to take that same eek that's already stayed to ethereum and then also sign up for additional slashing conditions for a separate and new network and so say there is an oracle Network that would also like your collateral as a bond to make sure that you correctly report the price you can restake your ether to that new Oracle Network and then you can get fees from that Oracle Network and then if you lie to that Oracle Network your ether that's also safe to the ethereum beacon train will also be slashed in theory so what's the problem in theory you could actually layer this restaking on over and over and over again for juice appeals and then people are like oh wait that's a lot of slashing conditions is that harming the security of ethereum and vitalik is like no that doesn't necessarily harm ethereum unless whatever these new networks are if one of them starts to be systemically important at this social layer and so at the hardware layer and the objectivity layer there is no it's like the restaking and restaking and reshaking the layering on of new networks that doesn't intrinsically threaten ethereum consensus what it would do is something like the 2016 Dow hack where if one of these networks has a lot of restake and something bad happens on that Network that's separate from ethereum then because that Network got so large and it had so much restaked eth to it that it became systemically important at the cultural level and then if the that we're staking a chain that got exploited would then ask for a rollback of or a hard Fork of ethereum it's that is dangerous 2016 is a perfect analog to this right um so is uh 2008 banking crisis I mean the the intrinsic problem is too big to fail when something becomes too big to fail and so the stakeholders at the social layer all agree well this has become too big to fail and if it fails there'll be such social costs to a particular set of stakeholders that we politically care about that we need to bail them out and then they go about that bailout process that's when things uh have this um this really negative externality in being too big to fail and vitalik is saying I am concerned unless we kind of guard at the social layer around this that that could happen with restaking and so you designers of restaking make sure you're doing it correctly make sure you're doing it well make sure you're doing it without introducing this Hazard into the social layer of ethereum and if it becomes too big to fail and there's the prospect the mention of some sort of a bailout that's when things move from like you know yellow to Orange to closer to Red I I think that's that's uh what he was communicating in the post at least to me and you could see all sorts of possible designs and it's not just you know what it's not just staking that could do this I could also see if you had a layer two that got kind of too big to fail or something let's say Layer Two too big to fail I had um I don't know Layer Two twenty percent broke or something yeah 20 of ether on it Bridge broke and all of The Ether that's deposited to arbitrum somehow was not able to be withdrawn from arbitrum in some weird way that we didn't expect would we roll back the chain it would really hurt to not roll back the chain and I don't think the ethereum community would do it you you think they wouldn't do it they would not do it it would hurt to do to not do it I agree it would take that to the face and also because of four Choice rules there would be a significant faction that actually want to fork eth in that situation I would expect I think I think it would be a contentious thing I think there'd be a battle I think it could be somewhat like the Dao and that you'd have um a group who says yeah no rollbacks never uh and then if it was big enough and if you don't think that would qualify arbitrine Bridge just imagine something bigger than David like more more eth more substantial to the um validators or whoever's kind of making the political decisions of ethereum you could you could see a world where that could happen what's interesting though about it is let's say there was some some event like that and it did happen and there was a fork right it's always interesting with a fork is uh etholders always end up with uh double the assets don't they I guess unless there's some sort of a force no hold on you I mean you can and I think that's have you collected your ether proof of work tokens Ryan no I mean but that's a just not a serious legitimate uh Fork right I certainly collected my ethereum classic and then I had the choice whether I I wanted to continue ethereum classic or whether I wanted to sell it and I think I along with the majority of the ethereum community sold ethereum classic and doubled down on on uh regular old ethereum and uh anyway what I'm saying is that's actually like the ultimate remedy for governance is if things got too contentious if there was some sort of too big to fail type event and there was a fork then all the stakeholders have to decide like it's very messy that's not like what we want to happen but um I'm just pushing it that to The Logical conclusion and right it's still not the end of the world I guess is what I'm saying speaking of forks there seems to be a bipartisan Fork here recently uh this is Ron desantes he announced his candidacy as a republican um a presidential candidate and he says this you've got every right to do Bitcoin to do Bitcoin I love that the only reason these people in Washington don't like it is because they don't control it let them do Bitcoin says Ron DeSantis that's interesting how uh there's been a growing set of Republicans that have taken the posture of being anti-cdbc and pro-crypto uh meanwhile it seems like the Democratic establishment not all of them of course in fact we've had democratic members of Congress on Bank lists in the last couple of weeks but there is a contingent of establishment I think Democrats maybe Elizabeth Warren and her ilk who are against friends I would say the Biden Administration is is one of them this is uh Joe Biden when he speaks about crypto he says things like this and this is him last week I'm not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto Traders while putting food assistance at risk of course I personally don't want to put food assistance at risk but uh incorporating I'm a big fan of crypto Traders with wealthy tax cheats is some political grouping that that I don't appreciate and I don't like so I'm wondering if this uh partisan divide will will kind of increase it does seem like if one party doubles down on an issue and Ron DeSantis is kind of making this part of his presidential announcement you've got every right to do Bitcoin he says then the other part party has to just be like oh they're doing this so we're going to do the exact opposite I just worry about that I don't even know if they've they've thought about this from a fundamentals uh like you know base principles perspective I didn't even know if Ronda Sanchez does I don't know even know if he cares he's just like oh here's a crypto cohort they have some money they have some influence I can get behind this issue maybe and so I'm going to be pro-crypto and then Democrats see the pro-crypto Republican and they're like they're Pro crypto we're going to be anti-crypto and no one actually has a conversation about this and looks at the base principles of like you know the things that we all care about or all have in common that's my uh my bear case for this David I don't know if you see that but yeah your bare voice isn't that political theaters just political theater and like yes the idea one of the cool things about crypto is that when you deeply understand crypto and you go down the crypto Rebel and you go and navigate the dark force of crypto and you come out the other under other side understanding how so much more of the world works and then you see the politics be like oh there's this new important thing and then the left and the right the red and the blue people just like squabble over it now regardless of the fundamentals they don't give a [ __ ] about our industry there's like oh now we fight over this thing like who wants that oh my God yeah I do like the idea of Ron De Santa saying let them do Bitcoin using Bitcoin as an idea not an actual noun it's like let them do Bitcoin using how intentional do you think that was I don't feel very intentional okay I don't think they're intentional oh wow well crypto is still continuing to build David we've got some releases this week uh the first from matcha let's just show the interface this is really cool and of course uh I can log in with metamask as I already have but uh matcha of course is a decentralized exchange aggregation service and in the background you know like decentralized exchange market share David we haven't shown this on the roll up in a while but market share of Dex volume to centralize exchange volume uh centralized exchanges are losing market share to decentralized exchanges recently and that's been huge but like look at this um this is matcha the new user interface the really cool thing about it is this the search token search functionality well-functioning token search in a UI before what do you want what do you want to buy some ARB oh boom it's there and matcha of course is a decentralized exchange aggregator so it's going to find you the best liquidity across all of it anyway all I'm saying is the user experience we here's what I'm saying we have 10 of Americans that hold crypto are using crypto today and the ux has been historically kind of bad what happens when the ux gets 5x better and 10x better uh cool things are going to happen and we're on the cusp of that and you can see that when you when you see releases like matcha that are happening pretty quietly in the background yeah this isn't just a front-end UI upgrade though uh they also have some protocol upgrades faster trade confirmations they say they've reduced failed trades by 85 they are still playing your gas fees although you are still paying it in a roundabout way uh but yeah at least you don't have to pay each which is nice and then they have indexed 3.7 million tokens uh to enable that 3.7 million is that a lot to have that many yeah coming up on releases connects has released chain abstraction so we've talked about account extraction but connects is doing this thing called chain abstraction uh and so if you want to say you have like usdc on arbitrome and you want to send that uscc to polygon to deploy it in Ave and that takes you like six transactions oh and then if you get over to polygon and you don't have any Matic in your wallet then your uscc is stuck until you get somatic in your wallet chain abstraction does the same thing as account extraction does for smart contract wallets but now we have like smart Bridges is so you can bundle up all these transactions all at once and then have that bridge and transfer and action on both chains done in one single transaction through connects which is a bridge by the way connects is a bridge and but now they are doing this thing called account abstraction so fewer steps to get what you want done across the chain really this fits into the theme of like ethereum and it's multi it's Layer Two strategy all the the Solana people are like oh you guys are breaking compost abilities breaking ux blah blah well the ethereum people in like the layer two layer three super chain people are like yeah but eventually all that will be abstracted it'll just be one unified super chain and this is part of that Journey chain abstraction there you go chain abstraction Builders you're building that's what I get from this last one here is uh Austria austria.xyz is a nft backed lending protocol so nft in borrow usdc or some other token out uh this is from Joseph Delong a former Sushi swap Fame uh and so if you are into the world of nft Phi estaria is for you yeah I think I said yeah Austria astaria sarya it's definitely Astoria there you go got some jobs of the week here jobs uh what are we looking at David otters uh bankless Ventures needs an uh investment analyst intern coinbase needs a staff blockchain engineer a staff smart contract engineer Phantom a software engineer for mobile and for front-end unit swap Labs a senior back-end engineer we got all the jobs

week use the term settlement Assurance multiple times can you please explain this term further thank you David is this your uh alt account that asks this question it feels like it's teeing you up just to talk about settlement assurances which I know it's something you're passionate about so tell us now's your chance tell us what are settlement assurances yeah so this is actually very deep in bankless lore I'd say there was a time where we really focus on this thing called settlement assurances and also uh public goods I wrote an article called settlement assurances in the global public goods thesis all of these things kind of tied together so this is like actually a really deep part of like bankless philosophy I'd say the importance of settlement assurances and back in like 2017 when I was getting into crypto like people were still getting confused about like Litecoin versus Bitcoin like Litecoin is Bitcoin but faster and better like yeah Litecoin blocks are four times faster but is the important thing about crypto is that when you make a transaction it is final it is in the blockchain and so like yeah you could make a Bitcoin and you could spin up so it has 10 trillion Trends 10 trillion transactions a minute is that what makes blockchains faster though can you just have faster blocks to make transactions more final um in the concept in the world of settlement insurance is the answer is no and so because bitcoin's proof of work is Hash rate is like hundreds of times faster than Litecoin technically even though Bitcoin is a slow blockchain it's transaction finality is the fastest that it's out of any blockchain that exists at least that's when I wrote it back in 2017. uh ethereum proof of stake and finality uh is actually now the new fastest because it takes six minutes to have billions of dollars of settlement assurances so you know that your transaction is in the in the chain or else there will be tens of billions of dollars of either burned if your transaction gets Unwound so Litecoin can't hold a candle to bitcoin's finality just because it has faster blocks now settlement insurance is also goes back to the Trad payment rails right except in the Trad payment rails you get settlement insurances from the court system so to undo a transaction in in the Trad world like you can go and undo an ACH transfer at any arbitrary time there is no finality in the in the Trad world there's finality in the crypto world because we operate by crypto economics so the idea of settlement insurances allows you to have property rights assurances this goes back to the idea of property rights the Assurance is that your property is yours and is not going to be taken from you because of settlement assurances um I've read an article about this I gave a talk at ethereal about this in 2019 and then we did we did an episode on this it's like episode five or episode seven of the bankless podcast uh and so actually I just went into the Discord just now and just uh wrote this answer out to tazu uh because I was so excited that they asked it which is how you know that I didn't actually asking myself and I just dumped all that stuff in there into the discords uh because I it's just such an important part of like how we think it really is really gets to the base layer of like why we're here and and the the entire thesis for crypto I think like settlement assurances is really the economic weight that is cementing your particular transaction uh on chain right it's all about property yeah it's all about economic weight and what's interesting too is what you can compare it across different chains of course but the comparison that you did with with nation states and you say like a transaction um is kind of settled by the court system can be undone by the court system there's even a layer under that right if your court system is functioning and Democratic and there's a set of rules yeah that makes sense what happens if your government becomes corrupt what happens if you are a political dissident against an authoritarian uh government leadership well not very difficult for them to unsettle no subtle transaction there's no finality really and so what are the settlement assurances of a nation-state it comes down to like who's in power who's in control yeah hopefully there's a constitution that kind of prohibits the people with guns from being able to do certain things and the society's governed that way but what if that fractures what if that decays the cool thing about crypto is it's all kind of economic weight we don't need to have guns and so it provides a different I I might say better yeah for the digital realm it is a better better a settlement Assurance it's also worldwide anyone with an internet system can access it one of the books um I can't think of the name Name Escapes me right now but it's an economic book around the growth of economies and it talks about how um property rights are the best predictor like the certainty and the stability of your property rights system is actually the predictor of a nation-state's success yeah that's it um what did America really get right in the early days by the way it took a long time for them to get here is property rights settlement assurances in the Pro and once they got that right man the economy was was humming people wanted to bring their businesses here entrepreneurs wanted to open up shop people wanted to bring their Capital to the country the economic network with better settlement assurances my God I feel like we have another podcast in US David asked the question yeah ah you caught me here we go we should go on to the next but maybe we uh maybe we need to dig deep in the archives and pull back some um some bankless content for kind of the new generation yeah yeah bankless lawyer let's get to this next question from Xerox Nader this was not me asking the question what are some of the biggest differences between this bear Market in 2019 what would you say to that yeah so in 2018 or 19 we were creating D5 for the very first time in fact we were coming up with a word for it like uniswap was created compound was created maker Dow was growing um the that was what was going on like it was a zero to one moment it was like we actually going into the last bear Market we really didn't know what ethereum was good for like we had to defend smart contracts scam icos that's awesome yeah and like and we also had smart contracts that blew up right so like we had to defend ethereum even though we had nothing to stand on as a foundation we had just an idea to protect that idea was correct because the next bull market happened was a D5 bull market D5 summer nfts blah blah blah so here we are in this bear Market what are we building now uh much more sophisticated Financial infrastructure uh Layer Two bridges for reduced stuff uh layer twos and bridges um and then uscc is huge the market cap of ether is massive I say what is being built now there's Direction and purpose and we know what needs to get built like the main difference in this bear Market is we know what we're doing last time we did not know what we're doing investment in this ecosystem is much more directional and with intent and purpose with a vision with a North star rather than just like wandering around in the dark so in addition to that we also have 10 to 100 times the amount of capital like we almost ran out of money last time and so those are the main differences the crypto's big gone are like the the most frustrating thing about uh and I picked up on this I think really early in my crypto career there's like a Bitcoin ether it could go to zero you could lose you could lose everything that you put in and people were saying that back in 2017 about Bitcoin you and I was like they can't they can't actually go to zero that's the point and we stopped saying that last bear Market or or you could say um if you say that Bitcoin or ether could go to zero then you could also say that about any other asset on the right yeah the dollar could go to zero right and gold would go to zero right sure it's all possible we're just talking about probabilities here right and so this bear market like no one's no one's saying these words and so everyone now and this is what it means to be priced in right ether was eighty dollars at the bottom 82 like 80 to 300 and now it's one thousand to two thousand dollars no one's pricing in like going to zero anymore um for Bitcoin and and ether and that that's producing much more stable foundation for people 2018. 2018 was existential we I I think of it as kind of a startup like Bitcoin did have product Market fit for some things but ethereum smart contract D5 no didn't happen we were doing Twitter on the layer one could you imagine it was it was a zero to wind a moment it was existential it's like you were a company pre-product Market fit and that is the hardest thing to do in an early stage company and most companies fail right there like most companies die most things die most networks most ideas die because they don't actually achieve product Market fit now I have complete certainty that ethereum smart contracts have product Market fit we've already done the zero to one the only question is how big is it going to get now we're just assessing what the total adjustable market for this thing is is it a 10x from here or 100x from here how many zeros we got left is the biggest how many zeros we got left how much of the uh you know like the the financial pie are these crypto networks going to be able to eat uh I happen to think it's gonna be a lot of them I happen to think it's going to be kind of dominant uh you know I think we end with uh I don't know man I haven't given out numbers in a long time but we're going to be tens of trillions of dollars in total crypto market cap remember at the intro we say that every week we're at one train million right now right uh 30 to 50 trillion I mean that seems with insight to me now where do you distribute that there's a lot of questions he's like how much goes to Ethan Bitcoin how much go to kind of the app layer don't know have all the answers to that but I do think that this entire new Financial system will be denominated in the base money systems of their respective dominant blockchains uh so that's pretty bullish for assets like ether anyway totally different world in 2019. I wasn't sure if we're going to make it now it's just a waiting game uh well we built there we go got some takes of the week David here is the first take I don't know if you saw this I'm just gonna play this uh for you this is from Fred Wilson you remember Fred Union Square Ventures all right this is what he says the context here is I think he was taking front of some sort of government body there's Barry silbert in the picture here and asking about crypto and here's what he says the lesson from the Internet is anything that China bans invests in uh and uh that's a joke but the US allows Google to operate here allows Twitter to operate here allows Bitcoin to operate here allows Facebook to operate here Chinese government doesn't allow any of those companies to operate the way they operate in this country or at all uh it's about Freedom ultimately uh I just love that take the lesson from the Internet is anything that China bans invest in of course um China has banned crypto in the past I would broaden this though Beyond China anything that the establishment is worried about or wants to ban invest in that thing this is part of a post where um Fred Wilson recently responded in one of his quarterly calls at unit Square Ventures which is a VC fund that that he operates um if they were going to respond to the regulatory pressure on web3 by divesting basically cutting back their investments in web3 and this is what he said when they want to shut it down I say double down so to Fred Wilson it is bullish that the authoritarians and the institutions that are threatened by this asset class want to shut it down what do you think about that I I love the line yeah uh I mean buy blood it's the same thing saying buy when there's blood in the streets it's like yeah so like we're getting choked out starting to bleed uh you should probably buy choked me harder okay all right Ryan I gotta take for you it's okay I learned this last week here at uh zuzalu okay uh have you heard of the millennial pause I didn't know this was a thing until I I saw this in these videos but why don't you explain this okay so the millennial pods is like when you're on Instagram or Tick Tock and you're recording yourself because you're about to post a tick tock or a story or something the millennial pause is this very brief moment right when they hit the record button and they wait for it to start recording and then they take a breath and say hey guys it's me I'm on this Tick Tock video blah blah blah and then the the it's called the millennial pause because the Zoomers are also on Tick Tock also on Instagram because they're of age now and they're like why the [ __ ] do you guys do that and well anyway what do you see an example of this yeah okay yeah open up the link we got Taylor Swift doing the millennial podcast okay so it's very very subtle and very very brief so you have to pay attention to the very very first moments of this video and this is every time a millennial basically records themselves doing yeah doing a selfie video all right here's Taylor Swift let me see if you can spot it it's that pause right it's just a hesitation when the video starts they're not already talking they're waiting for the video to start so when I first did that I when I first watched this I was like uh yeah that's how you do videos like is there another way to do video apparently there is so yeah so what is the contrast with Gen Z so there's there's the Genesis got the Gen Z Shake which is the the equivalent to the millennial pasta what is it does he say shake it's like when they hit record they put their phone down and they continue to talk to the camera because it's like candid and the the important thing about this why I thought this was cool is that this comes from when Millennials watch this camera and phone and internet technology arise and go from [ __ ] to good when we hit record previously you would wait for the software to kick in so for the recording to start and you need to wait for it to happen yeah now if with modern iPhones and like Android phones that it just it's instantaneous but we still waiting and so the Zoomers are calling Millennials Boomers because of this Millennial pause thing we're waiting for our Antiquated old technology to like start recording and but okay so but the Gen Z Shake is that they hit record and then they set their phone down and then they start talking and so they're talking as they set the phone down but the phone is shaking because they're setting it down and so they're and so like they don't wait for hey guys they don't wait for the breath they don't say filler words they just go right into the conversation so they hit record and simultaneously start talking and saying hey you know when that thing happens you'll have seen this if you've ever watched something you know on Tick Tock or okay so this is the Gen Z Shake right that was it do you see it yeah I mean that was your exaggerated she's doing it on purpose but yeah yeah that was I just think it's so cool how like both hardware and software that improves over time impacts the people that use it right uh I I thought that was like a very fun phenomenon that like Zoomers are calling Millennials like yeah you do you just did the millennial cause and then we're like what do you mean the millennial pods what am I doing I think it is so fascinating to see how you know technology impacts culture and behavior are you gonna stop doing the millennial pause or now you're just gonna notice it do you think I'm the type of person to record selfies and post them to tick tock do you think I do this you guys should see the a bankless tick tock Channel it is nothing there's nothing going on there because Dave and I suck at this all right man all right so thank you for bringing that to our attention now now I know uh tell me what are you bullish on this week uh okay so I was on the Solana podcast what right yeah so it's called the validated podcast uh hosted by Austin uh Federer I've actually hung out with him a couple times in real life um so we talked about like the differences between ethereum and Solana uh and so I thought that was it was a really cool um I made a big like call to action I like talked about how bankless came to be is a lot of it is about bankless right um and how like we are kind of the the voice of ethereum and I was like yeah so like there's a lot of people this a lot of community came into the world of crypto in 2021. they didn't go through the same like upbringing that the ethereum people had in the last bear Market where we were just harassed by bitcoiners and we had to prove our legitimacy improve the generational difference it's a generational difference and they I they so like they skipped that in my mind uh and so they skipped over the idea of settlement assurances which ethereum and bitcoiners are aligned by they skipped over the conversations of like what makes a full note and why do you need to have a full node that's easy to manage and easy to run we skipped they skipped the conversation of what is money and so like they're coming in and then like the ethereum people are like hey like don't use centralized trains you pay the gas fees and you'll like it and like understanding that that's not like a way to onboard new users uh we just we just went back and forth on like the philosophical differences in like the the upbringings of these communities I thought it was a really good podcast uh it's actually going to come out on the bankless RSS feed um soon maybe this weekend uh and so it will be in your inbox player as well I asked Austin if we could release it here on Bank list and so he said yes and send me the file so that'll come soon to this podcast player I think um one thing that I think it's true that I'm not sure a lot of people agree with but uh I think it's true anyway is I believe very much that um Solana is good for ethereum um I think Solana the Solana Community would probably say ethereum is good for Solana you know it sort of came first I actually think Solana is is good for ethereum it's really kept ethereum on its toes from a user experience perspective right um even like developing while it's like Phantom which are now coming back to you um coming to ethereum right but this the prioritization of user onboarding um I mean ethereum hasn't had that it's it's been a little bit of what you've said of like you will pay high gas fees and you'll like it and you'll you'll deal with art like shitty ux and you'll like it and Solana is a bit more like hey like we need to onboard people quickly and ethereum sometimes ethereum will be like but you're cutting Corners right um and but I think there's probably a healthy balance of how can you improve your ux without cutting those Corners anyway I just think that Community has made ethereum sharper as well uh I don't know if everyone agrees with that but there's a take that's what we do on Bank lists it takes all the time all right what do you what do you polish on I bullish on uh this this is a tweet from Ryan berkman's um on tokenized treasuries I didn't know this before I actually read this tweet here's a fact sheet total value locked from zero dollars to 200 million dollars in three and a half months half a dozen good competitors the yield on tokenized treasuries the future of tokenized treasuries right now because interest rates so are so high 4.75 percent you can see this in a dune analytics a dashboard but the idea David of tokenized t-bills actually gets me kind of excited and I'm not the type to be excited by like on-chain real world assets but like we don't find this type of of yield in D5 these days 4.75 so I think if we can onboard more t-bills on chain to ethereum uh this is an area of growth for us I mean the amount of real world assets that we have on chain is pretty low and T bills are like pretty simple they should be very simple to actually deploy and and put on chain and even the idea of this this is in in Ryan's tweet here personally I hope we'll see a tokenized t-bill with whitelist minting permissionless uh trading secondary one unit equals one dollar with rebasing yield this would be a usdc competitor that passes its yield on to customers whereas usdc has a hundred percent take rate so imagine there was a version of usdc in quotes that was instead of dollars tokenized t-bills gives you that additional 4.75 juice you actually can't access that as a fungible token in the real world can you you can't like go spend t-bills at a store you have to have dollars but you should be able to shouldn't you and a tokenized t-bill would make that happen so I didn't expect to like be bullish this week on real world assets let alone t-bills but I'm kind of weirdly bullish on the the marrying of the two things uh and that is why I mean crypto people love their yield right so it makes sense uh and all all capital wants to converge uh and so Capital will find its way naturally to ethereum as the epicenter The Logical conclusion of where Capital will go makes sense to me have I made you bullish on it I'm always bullish unreal that's not bullish on that I've always published assets uh before it was cool uh uh so it was edcon uh this last week uh it is the ethereum develop like educational convention conference uh and last year uh so in in this photo this is a uh how it's how it started how it's going kind of meme uh this is an Instagram account of this man named Mickey who is probably going to be the prime minister of Montenegro elections are in two weeks uh last year uh vitalika and montenegrin passport and this year edcon he also got this like traditional montenegrin like garb I'm not even going to be able to try and explain this for the podcast listeners but the guy is looking how would you even describe that I don't know I without um misplacing my cultures here I actually don't know what this looks like um anyways uh so Mickey this is actually a story about Mickey uh the incoming potential prime minister of Montenegro uh I don't have time to explain it in this one meme because this is just the meme of the week but uh it's bullish it's bullish crypto it sounds like crypto and making Montenegro like natively a crypto country um so kind of like El Salvador Like official Bitcoin is like the official currency of of El Salvador that except it makes sense in Montenegro kind of like that but with plans that actually make sense yeah well that would be bullish if that would be kids get something like that um very good well guys thank you for being with us on the roll up again this week risks and disclaimers of course none of this has been Financial advice what do we say every week crypto is risky so is Bitcoin so is ether so is D5 you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
