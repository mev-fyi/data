[Music] welcome bankless nation to this extremely special episode of meet the nation where we bring back on frequently returning guest kevin owaki this time to announce a couple cool very fantastic new releases into the world and into the bankless ecosystem uh kevin owaki for those that don't know he is the og uh person behind git coin uh and now git coin dao and kevin of all people is the most committed to public goods uh of anyone that i've met in the crypto ecosystem and in my opinion kevin just straight up gets it what is crypto about and why can it bring goodness into the world kevin has those answers and that's why i'm extremely excited to do the thing that i think bank list does the best which is release new podcasts so kevin milwaukee is coming with the bankless network to produce the green pill podcast all about trying to convince people to take the green pill and in this uh quick show i do with kevin owaki we explain what that means what does it mean to take the green pill what is the green pill and also what can you expect from the green pill podcast hosted by kevin owaki on the bankless network and in addition to that he also has his green pill book which is just you know the the base foundations of what is going to become a green pill movement we also talk about who is going to be coming on the green pill podcast what types of conversations uh are going to be had there how is the green pill podcast going to talk about things outside the crypto world and into the the more traditional world and trying to reorient the narrative around crypto into being ones of public goods and public utilities so i'm really excited to help kevin owaki get this podcast out the door so without further ado let's go ahead and get right into this conversation with kevin owaki without any break for the sponsors that make this show possible kevin i've been informed that i'm about to get green pilled so i'm sitting down um what what does that mean what's going on how am i getting green peeled uh hey david thanks for having me so uh gitcoin is launching greenpill.party and a bunch of activations associated with greenpill the idea is that green pilling is choosing regenerative crypto economics it's choosing to be a regen instead of a dgen and that means funding public goods that means building impact owls that means choosing to build a more regenerative world with uh with crypto economics and um we're going to be having a bunch of activations around shelling point the one day conference at east denver and a bunch of uh different things that you can do in order to green pill yourself and others in the next couple weeks okay let's start with uh regen not degen what does it mean to be regen instead of a d-gen yeah so uh regenerative crypto economics the definition that we've come up with is anything that has positive externalities for the world so you think of a regenerative system as something that creates net positive uh either financial outcomes or outcomes for humanity and um you know an example of that is get coindal right we the externality for get coindao is public goods funding for the rest of the ethereum ecosystem i'm also excited about other impact owls like proof of humanity that creates an externality of more civil resistance for the ecosystem digital identity climadow which is creating an externality of more pricing for carbon credits out into the world so the atomic building block of regenerative cryptoeconomics is impact owls things that create positive externalities for the world and i think the world is uh a lot of the world's familiar with the concept of externalities and most of them are are negative externalities such as you know the smog escaping out of a factory or when people dump toxic sludge into public ocean uh you know or riverways uh positive externalities are what i think you and i are really just excited about ethereum about and crypto at large is because the whole entire concept of like tinkering with incentives or just like incentive alignment is talking about the ability to create positive externalities where our normal human behaviors can be reoriented into making things positive rather than making things negative and so we've talked about this a lot people are familiar with the concept of moloch but moloch doesn't exactly scale towards the whole entire world and i think that's where this green pill concept comes in can you talk about the difference between moloch and greenpeal yeah well you know it's funny that you say that because uh there are web scale global coordination failures that humanity is facing right now we're facing climate change we're facing misinformation we're facing a lack of funding for public goods and i think that solving those coordination failures is one of the really amazing things that the ethereum ecosystem could do i mean we've just been gifted this transparent immutable programmable global substrate for human coordination and what if we can solve that coordination failure using like it's programmable and we can choose to use it to solve coordination failures that are global in a way that nation states which could only solve nation-state-based coordination failures in the past could could do and so one of the things that i want to do is open people up to the uh the opportunity and the and the possibility that we could be building a civilizational scale of infrastructure for regenerative finance and for open source finance that has a ton of uh net externalities that are positive for the world and um you know if you've if you've listened to some of the shows that we've done together in the past david the one about molok that we did with amin solomoni moloch is uh the the demon god of coordination failure i don't actually believe that there's a demon god out there but if you think about like the shared psychic manifestation of all of these different coordination failures as moloch then that's kind of like ethereum could be the sword that slays molok if we choose to draw it from the stone and build these regenerative systems and and um you know green pill is just a way of of spreading that meme in a way that's more digestible by everyday members of society that don't have to learn about uh uh deep economic concepts like public goods or maybe some off-putting concepts like moloch like demon gods green pilling is more of a participatory consumable way of consuming the meme of regenerative crypto yeah so the the whole pilled meme is a something that has taken shape it's it's in very many many different communities uh we talk about crypto pilling people bitcoiners will say they took the orange pill the bitcoin pill there's also other like non-crypto related communities that also talk about taking the pill and it really just is like uh having this aha moment about like oh i'm now aligned with this concept with this idea no one has yet taken the color green uh and the color green why the color green kevin why green pill yeah that's a great great question um so i guess i want to talk i'm going to answer your question but really quick values of cryptoeconomic systems we have all come into this space as uh cyberpunks uh advocating widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy enhancing technologies and creating a future that is more credibly neutral and accessible finance for the world and i strongly believe in cyberpunk values and i think that those are really amazing um but another thing that i have in my value system is the idea of solar punk a future in which humanity has succeeded in solving its major contemporary uh challenges around sustainability things like climate change things like underfunded digital infrastructure or just underfunded infrastructure in general and solar punk is kind of an evocative of a green integrated sort of mindset and um boy i'm really i think that we're kind of like taking a look at what uh the libertarian left thinks the vision of the world can be we we not only have strong privacy and strong sovereignty but we also have solved coordination failures and i think that uh green is the color of the earth and of like the gaia hypothesis and it's the ultimate sort of color manifestation to me of what it means to create a world that's more sustainable so um as we are we are including the cypherpunk ethos in this in this green solar punk ethos when we talk about green pilling people and let's get it really really concrete uh and also i'm gonna try and uh hit two birds with one stone with this next question there's a bunch of just anti-crypto narratives these days like people just hate crypto uh crypto's coming to destroy the planet nfts are terrible they're all scams uh but but also at the same time if you're inside the crypto you think web 3 protocols give power to the individual they allow communities to have voice and voice their values in ways that they didn't that other systems didn't previously enable uh and so how do you see this green pill effort kind of helping change the narrative about you know crypto's branding in in the world and also like wake people up to this concept of social structures that more align with the ability to actually fight coordination failures yeah well you know i'm not a marketing person and i strongly believe that action trump's speech and i think that what we can do is we can build a more regenerative uh infrastructure for the world using crypto and then the narrative naturally flows out from that but uh you know maybe that's the wishful thinking in me i do think that um you know danny ryan wrote a forward for uh i'm releasing a book it's called green pilled about uh how crypto can regenerate the world and danny ryan who is shepherding the merge forward wrote a forward for the book which was all about how ethereum is going to become almost carbon neutral when proof of stake rolls out and so i think that that's the opportunity for the crypto ecosystem to first do no harm not create as much energy energy consumption as it was before but then from there we've got this coordination substrate in which we can solve all sorts of coordination failures for local communities and their values or global problems like climate change or digital infrastructure and stuff like that so um i do think that there's a turning point in which people can really start to see that crypto is good for the world and not because someone's telling them but because someone's showing them and that's what we're trying to do at get coin get coins funded 51 million dollars worth of open source software over the last three years and we're trying to create this this fractal of decentralized innovation growth and impact for the world and i hope that that is what calms the critics not what anyone claims is true but what they actually see is true because they see that we're actually building that this world in in the ethereum ecosystem okay so that was the the first teaser the first uh product of of literature outside of the green-pilled uh ecosystem is this like the green pill manifesto is that what this book is oh i don't know i'm not like the type of person to write a manifesto but what i have done is uh this greenfield book which you can get at store.gitcoin.com i'll probably give away the digital copy for free just because i want these ideas out there the um basically what it is is it just kind of talks about how what's our moment of opportunity with ethereum and this global programmable substrate for coordination and then the meat of the book is really talking about designing coordination mechanisms understanding the prisoner's dilemma coordination games bentoism uh donut economies uh regenerative regenerative concepts that have existed for hundreds of years that we're now taking forward into crypto economics is basically the idea so it's primarily an education apparatus for people to understand that it's all coordination and it always has been and uh secondarily i guess it maybe serves a little bit as a manifesto for a green-pilled movement within the cryptoeconomic culture you say that you're not a marketing person but you're writing books uh to help spread the awareness spread education and that's not the only thing you are doing you're also starting a podcast and this is the other cool thing that we're dropping here on this video is kevin owaki is starting his own green pill podcast so you're writing books you're starting podcasts tell us a little bit more about the the efforts of the podcast and why the entrance into the world of content production yeah totally well first off on the marketing point i tweeted the other day that other dials have marketing and git coin dao has lore so i think that that's what i'm what i'm doing when i think about it but yes we're starting a podcast about green pilling people and uh it's all about regenerative crypto economics what can we learn about creating more regenerative financial infrastructure from biology biomimicry from the traditional financial system from game theory and the first podcast guest that we're gonna have is vitalik buterin himself but i've also lined up episodes with carl flores the founder of optimism one of the biggest public goods funders in the world santi siri the founder of proof of humanity glenn weil from radical exchange peter pan manu from doing good we've got a stacked lineup of people who really care about public goods and regenerative crypto that we're going to be rolling out on the bankless network to start so really excited to be working with you on this david yeah so this is a collaboration between kevin owaki and then the the back end of bank list so we're going to be doing the just the editing the infrastructure to really enable kevin to do what he does best which is talk about green-pilling people talk about public goods and solving coordination failures what kind of mindset should listeners go into your podcast with what do you want them to be able to tap into to learn as they go through all of your podcasts what are your goals for the listener as they listen to it yeah i think my primary goal is to build in public and to discover what type of game theoretic concepts are possible within uh regenerative crypto economics and then showcase the builders who are actually building these things and what i really hope to do is um you know i dedicated my book to generation alpha and generation z a generation that i think has been handed declining institutions and decaying hope for the future of humanity on this planet by the baby boomers and the older generations and what i really hope to do is create this groundswell of hope for people that we can build better institutions with stuff that is fundamentally 21st century native like crypto economics and what i hope is that is that we're we're showing not telling as this green-pilled regenerative economics movement starts and i've really been inspired by audrey tang who has this really amazing quote about being the channel through which greater combinations of intelligence and strength come together not being the minister for any group or to broadcast any sort of propaganda or marketing but to be that channel for greater combinations of strength and intelligence to come together and that is the ultimate hope for the green pill podcast is to showcase the builders who are doing it and to bring people who are subject matter experts that can create the literature on how this is going to be done all into one place and bring it to the bank the bankless network so who is this podcast really for is this for the crypto experts or the crew the crypto 101s or maybe this is a podcast for more than just crypto people who would you say is your audience that you're really looking to speak speak towards the audience is people who are going west and want to see that there's infrastructure built around it i mean you know we have all this infrastructure that we're used to in the physical world and if we're going to be going west in our digital world and going bankless we're going to need there to be infrastructure for the internet of jobs where you can earn and earn an income uh for for you to contribute to the public good of the towns and cities that we're building in the metaverse or the plural verse and uh it's going to be all it's it's going to be about all those things so if you're going west and you want to learn about how you can have a positive impact on the world and pay your mortgage at the same time that's who who this podcast is for is there any prior knowledge that uh listeners need to come in with to the greenpeal podcast or is this also just for you know i kind of understand bitcoin so therefore i can follow along with green pillar or is it more for the crypto advanced yeah i mean i think that you know we'll probably start a little bit more with the crypto events and then try to experiment with ways to make it more approachable by people who are new to the ecosystem you know say you joined because you bought an nft over the last six or nine months and you're not aware of moloch and you're not aware of coordination games like the prisoner's dilemma this is an educational outlet where you can or you can learn about those things and you know the main thing that i want to do is i want to show people that the value of cypherpunks and the values of solar punks are not paradoxes with each other we can build a more cypherpunk world that is also more solar punk and i think that there's hundreds of people that are that are just on the precipice of that that if we can just show them the way if we can green pill them then i think that we can pull them down that funnel so uh it's gonna start off to answer your question more directly it's gonna start off more advanced but i think that we're gonna try to create some more beginner-friendly content as we gain steam so kevin in the in that effort i want to ask you some of the same questions i've already asked you so far on the show but i want you to uh do it as if i'm a five-year-old so this is the explain like i'm five explain like i'm five what is green pilk we've been talking about like moloch and crypto economics and prisoners dilemma and coordination games uh and coordination failures yeah i don't want any of that explain like i'm five what is green pill yeah well why don't you take one of these green pills david you're a five-year-old you like candy right yeah i do like take that these are just these are just tic tacs but they've got a green pill uh sticker on them so i don't know if we're gonna start them young maybe giving out candy is the is the way to go um no i mean i think that the actual answer to your question explaining it like i have five david is that uh uh green pilling is just accepting that we can build a better world with 21st century technology um we've inherited all these institutions from the 20th century let's let's build infrastructure that's web native and web scale easy easy okay so you got the book it's uh where can people get the book again greenpil.party you can go in order to subscribe to the podcast to get the book or you can make a pledge to actually give part of your wealth back to the public good and um it you can go to great greenpill.party in order to get all three of those things and if you see me at east denver ask me for some green m ms or some green tic tacs i'll green kill you on site okay so there's definitely links in the show notes uh kevin milwaukee has a brand new rss feed for which the green pill podcast is going to go out it will also be going out on the bankless rss feed for about the first four ish episodes so you will get your first taste of green pill there on the blankless rss feed but eventually it will migrate and fold out into its own rss feed of which it has already started so that link is in the show notes so you guys can go subscribe to green pill right now you can also go to exactly where kevin said greenpill.party to access the book uh and also to pledge uh elaborate on the pledge side of things a little bit for us kevin yeah so you know the fundamental building block of regenerative crypto economics is just creating positive externalities for the world you can create a complicated cryptoeconomic system to do that like bitcoin has with quadratic funding or you just go to this website and say hey like i've made some gains over the last couple years um and i know that i want to build my legacy and that i want to contribute back to this world and you can just pledge just send a tweet that says that i'm gonna give one percent of my wealth to public goods and i think that the that's the idea behind the pledge is that it's creating a social consensus that hey like it's cool to make some make some money but you know what's cooler is paying that forward to the next person who's coming into the ecosystem and is building uh is building something good for the ecosystem so you can take the pledge at greenpill.party let's say that we as a society as crypto people we all fight for the green pill fight but it doesn't work sadly and the world does not experience regenerative regenerative crypto economics it doesn't really emphasize public goods what does that world look like yeah well you know this is the the ultimate paradox of all these things is that it's all coordination and it always has been but coordination is a choice and if we don't choose to coordinate to steer the world towards these outcomes then it likely won't work but you know i i kind of don't want to live in a world in which there's climate change which is making the outdoors uninhabitable for three months out of the year because there's wildfire smoke i don't want to live in an information environment in which information is just poison and i can't tell the difference between psyops from one of my adversaries and someone who genuinely wants to build common understanding um i don't want to wake up and sign on to an internet that's fundamentally insecure and has surveillance baked in at the base layer and and i think that those are just three examples of public goods and common infrastructure that we want to be buy and for the people as opposed to uh infrastructure that's used against us or infrastructure that's that's outdated and so uh you know i think that on my first appearance on bankless one of the things that i said is what good is a lambo if the sky is on fire you know how much are you going to enjoy your lambo if you have lung cancer because we we didn't take care of our earth and we didn't take care of the public goods around us and and one of the things that i want people to know is that you know you may think a lot about the stuff that you're going to buy on amazon or the things that you're going to buy with your crypto gains but 80 of the value that you get in the world is from things like transportation networks or digital digital infrastructure it's all the things that we take for granted that are actually providing a lot of the value in our lives and i think that if we can get people to see those things and not take them for granted then we can steer the world towards that coordination and towards that world that's a little bit more green pilled and you know the stakes are high public goods are are a lot of the different things around us and so i just hope that we can steer ourselves to an infrastructure that supports public goods as it promotes more sovereignty for the individuals well i think you guys can hear how eloquent and precise kevin is in his speech so if you want a whole entire podcast of that go click that link in the show notes to go subscribe to green pill i'm really excited to see and hear some of the episodes that evan oh excuse me that kevin produces out of green pill and i'm just honored to be able to help produce them over here at bankless uh so kevin thank you for trying to green pill the earth take the green pill david take the green pill i'm taking him i'm taking him as soon as i get to eat denver awesome i'm at it [Music] hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto investing skills and
