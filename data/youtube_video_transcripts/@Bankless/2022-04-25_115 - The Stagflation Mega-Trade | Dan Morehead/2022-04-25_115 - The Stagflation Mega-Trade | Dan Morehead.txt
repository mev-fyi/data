welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a fantastic episode with dan moorhead we're talking about the year ahead for crypto how to survive this bond bubble we've got inflation at all-time highs what do we make of this uh dan is the perfect combo of macro plus crypto investor to help us navigate these uncharted waters a few takeaways to look out for it number one we actually talk about why inflation is 8.5 percent right now number two we talk about this thing he calls the bond bubble and the coming great unwinding of that bond bubble figure out what that means as we do the episode also are rising interest rates bad for crypto maybe not maybe not this time that's what dan makes the case for uh how to structure your crypto portfolio in the midst of all this and finally a little bonus tidbit somewhere mid-show you have to look for it how to short bonds if you believe what dan is saying bonds are going to go down he talks about how to short them david this was a really fun podcast uh i learned a lot brought a lot of pieces together i think with what's going on in the current macro environment which is hugely relevant to the crypto industry and the crypto story over the last like decade it's been in existence and will continue to be massively relevant into the future i mean dan was actually talking about when uh the nation states of the world central banks would start purchasing crypto he thinks that's coming in the future what were some of your thoughts i think this moment in history is the moment that dan himself dan specifically was really meant for uh dan has been paying attention to just the macro markets i think since he became an investor in general uh back in the back in the 70s and 80s and he started pantera as a macro fund but but pivoted into a crypto fund in 2013 because he saw the writing on the walls that so many who were early in this industry saw and realized that crypto is macro but he he dropped this one line that i think explains it well crypto is like like buying gold but back in back in like the bc era right back when people were trading just like apples for gold right like imagine buying gold before it even had a dollar price and that's what dan saw in 2013 so a crypto a macro person who saw the writing on the wall and saw the crypto was eventually going to become a macro relevant crypto asset class so pivoted entire fund to become a crypto fund and this moment right now where inflation is at 8.5 percent the timing of this podcast couldn't be better because dan has been paying attention to the bond markets that what the federal reserve is up to and what is now what he is calling the great unwinding of nine trillion dollars of the federal reserve balance sheet is going into the bond market which usually would spell the death for a lot of risk on assets but dan's making the case that not this time people are people are waking up to that perhaps it's time to vote with your dollars and exit the system and the crypto uh while this is very similar to stagflation in the 70s which is another topic that we got into the main difference this time is we didn't have crypto in the 70s ryan like we have the escape route we have the escape hatch and that is crypto so how is this similar to the 70s is a big theme of this episode but how is it different because crypto's here is also a big theme with this episode and i just learned an absolute ton with dan here yeah you guys are going to absolutely love it of course after the show dave and i are getting ready to record our

went all in on crypto at that time and uh at bagless we just think macro plus crypto is such a deadly combination particularly for navigating this next decade and we think you need the skills to navigate this next decade because it's going to be different than all of the decades perceived preceding it that's why we're having dan on to help equip us with some of the insight and skills dan welcome to bankless it's great to have you hey thanks for having me hey man we're going to cover like two things today if that's cool um the first is sort of like what's happening the big macro landscape inflation bonds the fed that sort of thing and the second is once we understand what's happening how to position for that does that sound good sounds great all right um let's talk about what's happening then inflation bonds the fed all right so the big thing right now uh in the news this week is inflation it's been in the news for the last months but i think this is the highest inflation something like 40 years 50 years something like this 8.5 cpi what's happening here can you tell us what's going on yeah so uh it's actually 35 years i've been doing this so i've seen a lot of cycles this is the craziest one ever the federal reserve pumped up a bubble in bonds that is just really off the charts got the bond market so far ahead of where it could or should be and the bond market is obviously what fuels the mortgage industry and a record number of americans took out a mortgage last year and bought property not surprisingly houses are up 19 percent so if you are a homeowner that's a good thing but 35 of americans are not so that i think it's a terrible thing so uh the fed's pumped up this massive bubble and it's created a massively overheated economy and the chairman of the fed about a year ago said it was a transitory blip in inflation this is not transitory this is a massive massive problem each month since powell said it was transitory it's printed a new record high and as you said we're back to inflation rates uh as measured as high as 1982. here's the wild thing the inflation rate really isn't very good a measure of the cost of housing in 1982 coincidentally the government decided to replace the cost of houses which is a very obvious thing you would use in housing inflation with a very arcane formula called owner's equivalent rent and if you use a normal index of house prices you'll see a much higher inflation so for example right now the urinary change in ownership equivalent rent is only 4.2 percent and for anybody out there trying to buy a house and only trying to offer four percent more than last year they know that doesn't work and anybody trying to rent an apartment knows 4.2 percent does not work so that if you used uh any kind of housing index like case shiller for example which is a very widely respected index uh the inflation rate's already 11 in kind of i consider true terms so we really are back to the craziest bit of the 70s so this is a kind of a question about the 8.5 uh figure do you think that's really the lower bound then you're saying maybe the the cpi that the metric that the fed uses to quote unquote measure inflation is um somewhat off in some ways what do you think the the actual range of inflation might be if that's the case yeah so i have been doing this a long time there's all kinds of nuts talking about inflation doesn't fairly you know the government doesn't barely measure things and yeah you know sometimes people make the argument for maybe an affluent consumer basket it's higher and all that stuff and so what what my argument here is is not to take any of those kind of little things it's just to focus on 35 percent of people's expenditure their biggest expenditure is housing you have to rent an apartment you have to buy a house and so it's by far the most important thing in inflation and the way the government currently calculates it with this owner's equivalent rent thing is very very slow it'll all come through over the next two or three years all that pressure will actually show up but it resets very very slowly and so if you take the current core inflation rate because the fed likes to exclude food and energy but again those are very big expenses for us so you know i think it is you know it's somewhat suspect to exclude this but if you exclude food and energy and take the core inflation rate but use case-shiller's uh index which is currently running 19.2 percent year over year you get a true core inflation rate of 10.7 and we have overnight fed funds at 25 basis fines that's the problem the fed is fueling a massive overheating of the market and uh it's frankly it's shocking how far behind they are on this that they're talking about maybe getting to neutrality like the us is clearly overheated like today's front page newspaper has the highest inflation rate in 40 years and they're talking about maybe over the next year or two in these little quarter point increments getting back to two percent i mean honestly it's really shocking how far the fed is away from reality and i think a lot of listeners uh are feeling this right it's it's one thing when you see the numbers it's another when you actually feel them and so grocery bills going up in price like gas and energy uh you know housing cost of living all of these things like like americans and i think not just the us but people around the world are really starting to feel these numbers in a way i think uh a lot of people have been alive have never experienced before what do you make of this that we're starting to to feel these numbers more no it is totally true that you know when inflation's you know very very low single digits it's kind of easy to not notice it but so many things now have a surcharge for whatever you know all these expenses and in our i think november investor that i used a really cool index i think because people can relate to it the cost of ubers has doubled and that to me that's such a great indication of the tightness in the labor market because gig economy workers are obviously people that are kind of right on the edge of wanting to work not wanting to work and you know a few years ago a lot of people wanted to do that and various government programs and and the booming economy have taken a lot of people out of the gig economy and so people are actually literally seeing it you know every time they do a ride it costs twice as much as it did two years ago and uh you know like uh used cars now are higher priced than when they're brand new that's super crazy it's never happened in history the price of a 2021 average model your car is more expensive today than when the person drove off the lot and that one there's a little bit of a supply chain issue there but it's just there are things happening right now that literally never happened before and it's happening across the spectrum you know basically everything uh is is on fire and more expensive and this is the the thing that everyone is experiencing for themselves stan so we all know this to be true we can see it in the gas prices we can see it in in like the milk prices and the grocery prices uh and so no one really questions that like everyone knows like oh yeah we have inflation now this is the paradigm that we live under but for a lot of people i think a lot of bankless listeners including myself who um kind of got educated on money and finance through crypto are kind of confused as to how we got here like you started this conversation off saying there's a bubble in the bond market and i actually don't really know what that means can you explain like how did we get a bubble in the bond market how how did this bubble just emerge where did it come from can you explain how we actually got arrived to this point sure so there's really two sides to the same coin here first is uh congress essentially approving nine trillion dollars worth of spending the us's deficits uh in the last two years have literally been bigger than any year in world war ii world war ii we were fighting fascism it was a big thing right and here the amount of money that's been spent uh fighting this invisible virus is staggering and very inefficient it's literally been 50 grand per family in the united states i mean that's just an enormous amount of money and obviously there were some policies that needed to happen and there's some people that really needed help but most of the people they got stimulus checks saved them the savings rate went up in a recession again something has never happened in history so nine trillion new pieces of paper dollars were printed and sent around to everybody again some a minority of whom really needed help and probably needed more help but most of the people didn't so would they do with it they bought stuff with it they bought stocks stocks are at record highs they bought you know gold they bought bonds so people invested all that free new printed money and there's a great line from milton friedman in the 70s uh inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon and i know there's some sticklers that say it's not totally always true but in this case if you print 9 trillion new pieces of paper money it takes more pieces of paper money to buy a 2021 car or a median home in the united states or a share of the s p 500 it just really is that simple and so if you print all this money there's just more dollars running around it you know buy things and we put a cool graphic up on our twitter feed a while ago which really inverted the price of money right normally we see the price of a bushel of corn in u.s dollars we see the price of an ounce of gold in u.s dollars you can flip that upside down and you can put the price of a u.s dollar in ounces of gold or bushels of corn it's the same story it's the dollar that's that's being debased and you know going down in value and you know ironically enough all the restless things are kind of constant so uh you know it really is the value of paper money is being debased is there also some difference here in how we printed it because i mean you know people will remember we've been printing a lot of money for a while in like 2008 the bailouts quantitative easing uh i imagine it was less maybe you might say an order of magnitude less but you can kind of educate us on that but have we done something different we didn't experience inflation in those years yeah so you know a couple of really important points there is we've tinkered with money printing since we went off the gold standard right and so we had a about of a lot of money printing in the 70s we had a ton of inflation um and then we kind of got everything under control for a while uh and then in the 2009 great financial crisis there was a bit of that and the fed started doing something then they had never done before not just managing the overnight cost of money but actually starting to manipulate the bond market which is a very very interesting and strange thing to be doing and so um the fed did it but they did it in much smaller uh sizes in it as you said it was an order of magnitude smaller so we saw a little bit of an impact this time though we've had a twin policy surge of printing enormous amounts of money literally mailing it to every american whether they needed it or not uh at the same time that the fed was then and so in the in the old days there used to be a term called bond vigilantes it would be when the government kind of got out of control bond investors would say hey i don't want to buy this debt at a ludicrously low yield so we're going to wait until the yields rise to an appropriate level and they wouldn't buy it this time the fed manipulated the market instead of allowing the free market to figure out where interest rates should be and interest rates are not this kind of esoteric concept that don't impact anybody they're where you can borrow and a mortgage right like they're really directly impacting you know the economy and construction and all that stuff and the fed decided to buy nine trillion of long dated bonds both government bonds and mortgage bonds are literally buying mortgages so i mean there's only one little intermediary between the federal reserve and a guy you know getting a mortgage buy a house right um the fed really became the lender for our entire country um and you know people are rational right if the fed manipulated the rate of mortgages down to at one point two point five percent which you know is astronomically small and the case-shiller index right now is at 19.2 so if the fed's going to loan you money at two and a half percent and you think a house is going to go up 19 they're basically daring you not to buy the house right like they're just they're making it hard like to be responsible and reasonable or whatever because they're providing money absurdly below its true value and that's creating a bubble one of the consequences of the bubble is it's driving up the price of homes so they have a ton of work to do and and you know one of the issues i see is somehow uh the fed has this kind of sense that there's some kind of kabuki theater about how they have to do forward guidance and tell everybody what they're going to do and steps that you know some kind of minuet that happens over the next two years or whatever when i was a kid the fed reacted in real time to reality right like if something happened they just changed rates and now we have this thing that oh you can only do 25 basis points you can only do it every six weeks at an fomc meeting and and um it's only going to add up to two percent over the next two years which is a as well totally surreal if you know rate should be at five percent right now so uh i i you know it is a fascinating occurrence and in 35 years of trading i've never seen something both so extreme and so massive right i've seen some weird trades in small little corners of the world some emerging market or something weird's happening but like the federal reserve is doing it nine trillion sized i mean this is you know this is the biggest bubble in our um december investor letter you know we said it is a bubble and we weren't talking about bitcoin which is what most you know cynics are always things bitcoin's a bubble it's the u.s mortgage and bond market and it's the federal reserve that's manipulating and they were literally buying bonds a month ago when you know everything's already obviously overheated and out of control dan by the way what's crazy about that uh that mortgage trade that you're talking about where um a two and a half percent or you know 2.25 mortgage uh in return for an asset that's going to appreciate has 20 per year like daring us not daring the average american not to go buy a home and get a mortgage and lever up as much as they can right basically that's been the trade and then also a backdrop of let's say you take a hundred thousand dollar mortgage out if you anticipate inflation is going to be in their future 8.5 it's all denominated in in dollars right well now the uh the amount you have to pay back at least in real terms has just decreased according to whatever inflation is so it really is just like for again the 35 of people who aren't in that position can't do it but for the remainder of america it's just like why the hell wouldn't i go get debt from the federal government it's like more free money on top of stimulus checks on top of all of the other things that they've pumped into the economy it is it's a massive subsidy from one group uh renters uh to another group homeowners right and it's uh it really it really is crazy because it's totally disadvantaging people that don't own a home and yes it is you know for the people have the circumstances to be able to buy a home or already own a home it's it's free money right like the fed is subsidizing home ownership um at a time when you know construction delays you know are we're maxed out there's no there's no rational reason to want to you know induce more housing construction here's my favorite stat on how crazy the fed got the housing market is there's a stat on the median time uh between when a house is listed and is sold and in the old days those months right because you know you put your house in the market you know it takes a while you finally sell it a few months ago that hit the bottom bound they only measure it in weeks and it hit one week across the entire united states and not just like super hot you know phoenix or whatever kansas everywhere the median time to sell a house was one week and the really crazy irony is home sales are now declining literally because there's not any more homes not not because there aren't more people that want to buy a home it's the inventory is now so small that even if there's a hundred people running around a neighborhood trying to buy a house there's only like five houses available so the actual the number of uh housing sales is declining literally because we're running out of homes to buy and capitalism works that means price of homes is going to go up right yeah this this is all quite unprecedented uh dan in your investor letter in december in december you had this graphic uh calculating a 15 trillion dollar overvaluation in the bond market and uh forecasting a very steep drop off from like the 40 trillion dollars back down to below 30 trillion dollars i'm wondering if you can kind of walk us through that math of that 15 trillion dollar overvaluation and then what happens next when the federal reserve tries to uh reduce the size of their balance sheet well can you kind of walk us through what you think happens next with all of this yeah so the main way to evaluate the value of a bond is to think about how much interest you're being paid above the rate of inflation right because as you said if you give somebody a hundred dollars and there's you know 10 inflation every year you know you've got to make more than 10 to break even and so the terms called real rates so it's the rate above the inflation rate and it makes a lot of sense and you know that's why it's called the real rate because it's actually the true rate you earn and uh that historically has been about two percent positive so you normally get about two percentage points more than inflation and you know over a 50-year period it's average two percent and that's what people think is relatively fair that only works when there's uh arms length economic actors in the market we don't have that right now we have a non-economic actor the fed manipulating the bond market and so they drove rates down to um gosh now they're you know minus 600 basis points so there are 800 basis points below its long-term historical average and so the graphic we did that shows the bubble and the 15 trillion over valuation is the value of the entire bond market both treasuries and mortgages if the market were priced at its normal two percent real rate and right now well when we first said it was 15 trillion over value i think it's about 12 trillion now and we we said hey you know maybe the past doesn't totally predict the future so maybe it doesn't go exactly back but what if it went halfway back that's 8 trillion of market cap that's going to evaporate and i i mean i think that's like a 90 chance of happening you know it's very very likely and the analog that we used uh you know for the old timers out there's a wiley e coyote moment and i think that's what it is is financial gravity doesn't work when someone as big as the fed can manipulate it and so they're hanging out there with bonds completely disconnected from where any uh rational independent actor would buy them and then they just stop buying them and then i think the fed is soon gonna realize they have to start selling bonds and get rates way back up and so you know we're in that that moment where you're levitating above the the chasm and i think in about two months probably the feds are going to realize you know hey this thing's really getting out of control instead of just kind of looks waiting around for these bonds to slowly mature which is going to take a long time because the majority of their bonds are like 20-year maturity um you know they're gonna have to start selling bonds and so when you go from the fed buying it billions and billions of bonds every month to now selling tens of billions the bonds are going to get crushed uh you know it's i i said in in our letter it's the first non-blockchain trade i've done in eight years because it's so asymmetric it's just like bitcoin or blockchain um and so i think it's like a 90 chance rates go way up and i think uh tenure rates are going to quadruple from where they were when we first started this which i mean that's you know that doesn't happen very often and and the punch line of bonds is you know if you're a homeowner and you're borrowing it at two and a half or you know you're short say you get short a 10-year treasury note at two percent right in ten years you can only be down 20 points right like that's absolutely the worst uh and i think bonds could drop 20 points in the next four or five months you know so it's one of those trades where it really has uh so much more upside than downside and again with the tiny exception 2009 when the fed did do a little bit of manipulation in the bomb market they've never done it before and frankly i just don't know why they're doing it it's it's like it's not it's not their mandate you know uh and so i i think this is getting badly unfortunately and then you can imagine congressional hearings blah blah and you know people just realizing hey that was a one-and-done experiment right and so i don't think fed's ever going to buy another bond again but uh they might be kind of compelled or somehow decide they need to sell their portfolio and until rates get way above five percent uh i think they have to keep uh encouraging rates to rise and since they own nine trillion bonds they could certainly do it right okay so one of the reasons why there's a big bubble in the bond market is because the fed has been buying the bonds right like raising the floor you know you're just a fake economic actor buying bonds so that's adding to the bubble but uh you said you just had nine trillion dollars on the fed balance sheet in bonds but um i think that's like only one third of the total market cap of bonds so who else is owning all of these bonds and why aren't they scared who's like if i was owning bonds and i saw the fed turn from a buyer to a seller i'd get really scared so like who's about to be holding the bag right well now largest owner is called the people's republic of china so you know the biggest owners of u.s bonds other than the federal reserve are other central banks who themselves are manipulating their currency price right so uh china and others accumulate reserves because they're trying to keep their currency from floating at a free market rate which would be you know higher or more valuable so it is a funny it is a funny situation where you know the fed is obviously manipulating bond market but so is people's republic of china and other large holders and that's a whole nother topic that you know with the russian invasion of the ukraine and sanctions you know uh can't imagine there's gonna be a marginal increase in the number of uh nation states that want to own uh you know bonds that can be forfeited locked whatever uh which you know we'll get to crypto at some point but you know i think that's net positive you know for crypto but the punch line is there aren't many like you probably don't own a lot of treasuries you know there aren't many like kind of normal people normal investors that do um you know when i was growing up there's the whole kind of 60 40 normal asset allocation mix 65 bonds 40 or 60 stocks 40 bonds i can't imagine you know i'm sure there's uh pension plans and insurance companies have kind of legacy portfolios that still have a decent amount of bonds but if you're looking at all the facts that we can see today as a normal free market investor it just is so hard to say hey you know at 2.7 for the next 10 years with inflation you know reported 8.5 but really at like 10.7 i'm gonna buy a 2.7 10-year note like it's just i really can't imagine how anyone would do that and and i think uh i think the penny is dropping but it's dropping very slowly and i think brian you mentioned a line that's very important um there is no working age american that has invested in a rising rate environment i mean that is so important to keep in our heads that i'm 56 and i was it was already six years into the bull market when i got to wall street right and the 10-year note was at 10 when i got to wall street right like so it could easily be 5 or 10 again right there's no but most people you know your age have literally never even come close to seeing a 10 10 year note right i think we're just all used to you know the fed just bails you out like oh you bought a little too much real estate or oh you know you invest in something it's not great well we'll just keep lowering rates and as you lower rates it just you know decreases the discount factor and just everything just kind of has been going up for 40 years because you know rates just keep going down and down and down uh in july of last year rates tenure rates had 54 basis points that's it that was the end of the bull market like rates certainly aren't going any lower than that and then i just i think we're in like a five years you know bear market on on bonds and we all have to get our head around that i'm still trying to figure out what that means you know in in our portfolios but i just think like you said that most most people are investing today never even thought about inflation and probably couldn't care less about the fed and you know don't really have never had to think about any of these things and i think you know unfortunately it's gonna be you know thrust upon us we're all gonna have to deal with like well what do we do with persistent you know double digit real inflation uh what do we do with rising uh fed rates and then i actually think the fed's inserting a lot of uncertainty by being so far behind the ball and still talking about trying to get to neutrality when it's apparently obvious that you know we're way overheated uh and we haven't even talked about the the labor market like the labor market is the thing that's totally uh impacted here so all those things are going to take a long time like you know years to deal with uh and then the last one added this whole list of things that you know are changing the way we're investing is uh for hundreds of years uh we've been globalizing and we've been just in time manufacturing all these trends all of them like the peace dividend you know and at the end of the cold war two billion people came into the labor pool you know so all these things were wonderful for the secular decline of both inflation and yields right they're all reversing right now hopefully it's all temporary hopefully the world kind of gets back to normal but like there's some trends where you know we're talking about localization and reshoring and you know uh that supposedly the way america is going to get out all this is like you know building more manufacturing in the u.s or whatever like none of those things are are good for lowering inflation and lowering yields and again hopefully all this is that that bit is kind of a temporary blip but uh many of these other things are very permanent and i think that's the thing that we all have to get our heads around a lot of a lot of big things are changing and most are for higher yields and and you know higher inflation for a while okay so just maybe to to kind of recap because we've talked about a a lot so far right but we have these unprecedented inflation rates the fed for whatever reason has seemed surprised by this caught flat-footed are like post-facto sort of reacting about this and they've also been they've been buying bonds since uh coveted started like you know uh massive amounts and so now we have this big bond bubble and a fed balance sheet to unwind and that's what's maybe beginning to happen that's starting to sink in that no longer purchasing bonds but maybe the fed will actually have to unwind its balance sheet and uh also interest rates are are increasing so the fed is trying to increase interest rates and and to your point like fed rates have been basically down only for the past i don't know how many decades for a very long time probably for most people's lifetime who are listening to this so that's all happening uh right now and i'm wondering like how unprecedented this actually is because i think the uh the fed chair recently um said this was unprecedented right sort of like a you know a different time but haven't we seen something like this before in us history and i know you were hearkening back to like world war ii spending certainly there's some of that with with kovid but also the 1970s that was a an era of very high inflation and uh i noticed in one of your recent letters which are fantastic by the way dan really enjoy reading those whenever i receive them is you did your group did a pantera did a comparison of like the 1970s versus today and there were some eerie uh similarities between that decade i think 19 february 1979 and where we are today i'm wondering if you could talk about this uh is this unprecedented or have we seen elements of this in in the decade that was the 1970s yeah it's such a great question and and i've been shocked at how slow the fed has been to see what's happening in real time i mean statistics are all have been very clear for at least six months you know maybe longer um and so uh their original line was its transitory and it's a supply shock and i just i think that perception was always wrong like it's not the problem isn't there's like a couple ships stuck outside long beach harbor right the supply shock is there are two million less americans working than before the pandemic started right and that's by choice the unemployment rate is as low as it's ever been right if there's policies that induce a lot of people that just leave the workforce so that's the problem man that can't be solved uh by just waiting for transitory you know time to kind of to go by so you know i do think uh the fed's been you know really really slow in in seeing this and then they've just said uh that it's unprecedented and i don't know it looks just like the 70s to me and so that's why we tied up our last investor lair it's called the 70s the precedent is the 1970s and basically all the stats are spot on the 70s and it's weird it's honestly and maybe it's you know i know but you know most of the fed governors they're you know my age or older they should they should have some sense that this is pretty similar and so many things are the same you know the amount of money printing's the same uh you know we even have wars and oil crises which are unfortunately exactly the same as 70s so um you know if you look at the stats you know uh gdp growth is exactly 5.5 where it was in 1979 you know uh everything is the same uh inflation inflation core cpi at the time was 11.3 in 1979. you know if you take the real housing price it's 10.7 so all these stats are similar wage inflation very high all that the difference is fed funds at the time we're 10 and there are 25 basis points now that is to disconnect that's the thing that's just so hard to understand there's literally never been a time the gap between the inflation rate and the overnight federal funds rate spend this wide like that's the only unprecedented thing is that the fed's so far behind the curve yeah what's what's crazy so uh we'll include a link to this chart and i think this is um for homework bankless listeners like go take a look at this chart from pantera on the february 1979 versus today and you'll notice there are two columns comparing all of these metrics that dan was just saying like cpi for instance that then it was point three percent now seven point nine percent i mean eight point five percent at this point in time uh core cpi again comparable to the 1970s go down this list you'll see a ton of comparisons to the 1970s except um three different rows the first is the fed balance sheet 1979 it was 3.6 percent now we have a reading of 115 all-time highs by far okay fed fund rates in the 1970s it was more reflective maybe of of the real market reality at 10 and now it's 0.25 okay and then 10-year bond yield again that was more reflective of the reality of of rewarding investors for the risk that they're um exposed to and taking a bond it was 9.1 in the night in 1979 now it's 2.4 percent so we have the inflation of the 1970s but we have a much less healthy fed balance sheet and a massive amount of manipulation that we didn't have in the 1970s that's the picture you're painting right oh it is and like i i think back uh if you would ask an economist in at that point you know should the fed be the only net buyer of bonds people would say oh that sounds super banana republic right so the central government prints all this money and then the other side of the government buys all that printed money and they just kind of keep doing this there's no impact anywhere that's the big difference i think people would have freaked if you would have said hey why doesn't the fed take the free market interest rate of 10 and ram it down to two and a half you know why don't we try that people would have said oh that's the world that's such a banana republic thing to do and you know the way we're behaving is total banana people what happened did the overton window just shift like we 2008 we were like oh we printed some money and everything turned out fine there's no inflation and so we just we just um society kind of accepted that this is the way things are and we do have the get out of jail free cards and we can use this at any time we want yeah so i actually don't totally know what shifted but one of the things is i think we've all collectively gotten so used to oh well if rates just always keep going down it doesn't actually matter how much debt we accumulate right because if rates keep going down and down and down even if you have 140 percent of gdp in debt if you're only paying 25 basis once it's count almost zero anyway so it doesn't matter and i just think somebody forgot to kind of take a step back and realize huh well maybe if rates do go up you know all this positive spiral actually starts cranking in the opposite direction it becomes a very negative spiral and that's the tricky math that um you know back in the 70s the you know debt to gdp was probably in the 50s maybe something like that and it's 140 now you can kind of do anything with debt at a 50 percent of gdp because you know it's not that impactful at 140 percent it's hard right all the numbers get there and so i i i just i just don't know what happened with the fed that i think they got so into this forward guidance kind of thing that you know talking about you know when they're gonna taper like a couple once they're going to talk about tapering the amount of bond manipulation they would do like you know it should have been tapered it should have been selling it should have been like crushing the bond it would have been way healthier for america if the fed started selling bonds six months ago rather than tapering so i don't know why they've been so slow at it but honestly i think there's gonna be a lot of phd theses written about this right it's it's they're so far behind um that you know i think that and unfortunately i think the damage is going to be greater than had they you know done this at the appropriate time six or nine months ago gotten rates to you know more appropriate level uh because you know we're now swinging at such extremes you know 19.2 percent you know housing inflation that's got everybody keyed up and they're all running to buy a house right like you know if humans are pavlovian man you give them a little treat and they just keep doing it so if you keep giving people you know 19 appreciation of the house they want to buy another one or they want to buy a bigger one and it takes it's going to take a lot more to unwind that right like it's because we've gotten this thing so fraught up and one of the great uh lines that we put in an investor letter is there's a line that encapsulates all the arcane logic of central banking by a old school fed governor william i think mcchesty martin in the 50s and he said the role of the fed is akin to a chaperone at a party that as soon as the party gets going has to take the punch bowl away so it doesn't you know really get out of hand and what the fed's been doing here is like an f1 racer with the champagne spraying like they are the opposite of taking the punch ball away they're just like spraying champagne on everybody and you know a lot of people get it like if the fed's gonna loan you money right now still the fed's loaning money at five percent to mortgages like you can get a mortgage at five you know and rate and houses are going up at 19 you know i don't know why i'm sitting here on this call i should go out and get a mortgage and buy a house right like it's you feel like you're missing out if you're not um if you're not doing it and so that's why i am afraid it's going to take a lot more to slow this down it's like a rhinoceros you know the housing marks like a rhinoceros and they get this little like pea shooter they're trying to stop it with 25 basis points not stop in the housing market right like and even uh you know even even honestly frankly and i originally said six months ago they were gonna have to raise rates to at least five percent even if that were happening today i don't know if that's enough right there's so much uh pent-up you know power in the economy right now so using that uh that metaphor of just like the champagne just being flowing flowing everywhere it feels like the hangover is coming but the hangover doesn't necessarily have to be felt by the same parts of the economy right so if we're going into stagflation uh dan you've said that you know this isn't unprecedented we've seen this all before uh i mean but me personally i was born in the 90s and ryan ryan was born in the 80s and that's going to encompass like 90 of bankless listeners is and so like for us that is that is unprecedented we've never had to navigate through stagflation before a lot of people don't even know what stagflation means by the way yeah so what parts of the economy are going to feel the hangover the most and how should people look towards the 70s for guidance here like how can we survive stagflation yeah it's a great question and that's why you know uh i certainly don't um don't uh think most of your listeners should know anything about this but the fed governors they're around for the 80s and the 70s and they also have phds in economics so even if they're not that old they should know and so to say it's unprecedented i think is is kind of a cop-out so um yeah so i think you know uh this the stagflation thing is coming that's a portmanteau the word stagnation and inflation together and it's it's an it's a tricky problem when you have you know not much growth and lots of inflation and there is an index in the 70s which is potentially going to come back called the misery index which is an addition of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate and uh luckily i think we're probably going to be you know close to full employment for a while so that's not the biggest problem it really is the inflation side of it but to combat that you know the fed's really going to have to get get engaged and not just stop buying bonds but you know essentially let the market determine i mean america's supposed to be this big free market economy right and we have a totally manipulated the largest market in the united states is manipulated i mean it's really a weird uh it's really a weird place for us to be and i forget the second half of your question you had another part of it that i i spaced on yeah it was just like which parts of the economy are going to be hit with this hangover the most oh so yeah i saw a member of congress just said something about you know we got these twin issues to deal with the covet hangover and inflation i'm like uh they're actually the same thing is the policy response to covet is why we have inflation right like they are the same thing and i think that's what is frustrating for me as a taxpayer and you know uh supporter of our our economy here it's just it still doesn't seem like congress is is getting it they're still talking about more stimulus and the economy is totally overheated so um so i think the unfortunate reality is it is going to have a very disproportionate impact on people and the kind of sad irony is the fed has actually spent a lot of time talking about uh the kind of inclusiveness of their policies and to help lower and middle income uh americans and frankly their policies have been terrible for uh those people and they're great if you own stocks and a house you love the fed right the majority of americans don't directly own stocks and 35 of americans don't own a house so i actually think the fed's policy has really been uh quite terrible for the majority of americans or young people right coming out of college you don't have a house so you don't want the fed you know artificially inflating the value of the housing market so uh the reality is it's definitely beneficial to anybody that owns stocks or crypto uh or um or house uh and then it's essentially disadvantaging people uh that are uh either don't own all those types of assets or on uh normal uh wages and so while uh the government has tried to tout you know the wage gains and uh the eci wage index is 5.7 percent which um is it the best measure of wages in the united states and benefits and everything people get which sounds great like wouldn't you love to get a 5.7 raise that would be totally awesome if everything didn't cost 8.5 more and so your net negative 2 250 basis points and so uh and again they're not surprising real wages which is wages above inflation used to be positive it used to be positive one percent uh and so it really is tricky you know this this policy mix which is unprecedented and totally extreme is disadvantaging people and you know i i would say that that you know the fed you know we did talk about their their word just now neutrality i mean you know do no harm right just get get back to doing less like the fed's doing too much and and again you know there are some segments of our society that are loving it it's been great uh and actually uh a record number of people have retired right so there's a lot of people there's a million americans you know uh have a house have their retirement plan set up they got to retire so they think this is great right you know so it is it's certainly good for some people but for our country as a whole i just don't think it's good and it's definitely disadvantaging huge segments of our society yeah i think the the millennials and gen z's are listening and watching baby boomers retire and realizing they can't even afford rent and they'll never be able to buy it honestly i hope you guys helped make this be a kind of a generational issue like i think here's the thing dan i i think so many of us like um definitely need to get involved in in politics and kind of you know shape shape things but at the same time so much of this just feels like we're all bound up on the on the wheel of fate like what can we possibly do go like stand outside somewhere in washington dc and just protest what jerome powell is doing an unelected bureaucrat and um you know the other powers that be i think there's some systemic issues that feel so much out of our control right now but one difference between the 1970s and now is uh now we have crypto we didn't have crypto in the 1970s and so let's kind of transition to the to the second part of this conversation which is now that we've established what's going on what's happening let's talk about what we can do individually how to prepare uh again it would be really nice if we had a plan in this conversation and how to fix fed monetary policy but like it's too broken i don't even i don't even know if i i don't even know if powell or any you know paul volcker of the of the 2020s will be able to actually fix all of this [ __ ] that's going on okay so now it's back to kind of the individual what do we do as individuals to try to save ourselves and those around us so how do we position for all of this dan what's going to happen in the great unwind what should we be buying what should we not be buying how should we position ourselves in life do you have any thoughts for us yeah that's an important uh statement and question and uh that is one of my lines it's like nobody asked me to vote on whether to spend 50 grand per family fighting an invisible virus like that i i would probably say no that's not very efficient so um but with crypto you get to vote with your wallet and so that is the advice is like if you're frustrated with policies that the fed is doing uh one is you can definitely vote for candidates for elected office that share whatever views you have and so although you can't influence the fed you can influence congress and uh your governor or your president so you can definitely do that but a practical way to do that is to opt out of debasement of paper money and opt into you know hard assets like crypto right it's um and that's why it's been so popular my favorite stat to show how popular crypto is is at the beginning of 2021 if you got you know a bunch of investors and economists in a room and you told them all those stats that we've just been over the inflation rate the you know wage inflation you know the house prices going up all those stats and you said you just have to pick which direction gold's gonna go up or down there's no one in the room that would have sit down and gold went down in 2021 it was down four percent because everybody's buying digital gold right like everybody's gone past the old school uh gold gold and bought digital gold and ethereum polkadot whatever so that is the right answer right is to opt out of the old system opt into the future you know payment rail of the world and so blockchain then that's why everyone loves it so much honestly and that they're so positive and hopeful is blockchain a from a financial standpoint allows you to you know manage your finances better and invest in things that won't be to base but then ultimately obviously you know collectively governed protocols are way better than the the kind of representative government ones that we currently have so uh and that's going to take 20 or 30 years i'm not saying you know dao is going to replace congress you know tomorrow but in like 20 to 30 years i think the world can be way better there's so many things about either centrally owned data monopolies or even governments that aren't really great for all the people which will be better when it's done in a blockchain based decentralized version so that and that's why blockchain keeps growing it just the more people that realize that it's empowering and you're opting out of a system that you don't have any control over and it hasn't worked very well uh and we're just the beginning of that right i think we have a couple more decades of people moving into blockchain so looking externally from the macro situation of the fed and and the us dollar there there's other like macro events that are going on that are relevant to crypto like the uh the ukraine war and all the fallout from that with regards to wheat production food production and oil production and energy production is also part of this overall macro picture that's impacting the crypto markets uh but that story has been pretty well digested i would say over the last three weeks like people have come to terms with what's going on and the general sentiment that i've gathered is that the crypto markets are holding up far better than people expected them uh over the last two to three weeks and so uh as and we've also at the same time digested the uh and accepted the unwinding of the federal reserve treasury right we're trying to unwind nine billion dollars uh interest rates are going to go up and and again the crypto markets after internalizing and digesting these news you know we are still at 3 000 ether uh we are still in the 40 000 bitcoin level uh and so what do you make of that crypt the crypto market response to what seems to be just a huge one two three four punch of macro to the crypto markets and the crypto markets are i mean they're not they're not you know doing anything like they were doing at the in 2021 right now but they are also not going down in the same way that they went down in 2018. what do you make of the crypto markets and how the crypto markets are digesting all of this macro news yeah it's a great question it just shows everybody has you know their own perspective i would actually say crypto has done a lot worse than i would have expected given all this and so it's cool that you you think is the opposite and the take i would have on this is you know we called the bond uh bubble of ponzi scheme on december 7th i think which was the high print of the bonds spot on couldn't have called it better was awesome but i had no idea that everything was going down 27 right like in the crypto industry and so that's you know when you're trading and it doesn't work you have to think about whether you're you know wrong or the markets are wrong and they're gonna revert and i really think that uh i'm massively bullish on crypto uh right now and i think that the reason i am uh partly it's because you know hey every two years for the last 10 years an order of magnesium more people come into crypto so i think that steady flow of just smart people reading about it is coming but the the other asset classes being destroyed i think is gonna sink in and it's basically there's almost nowhere to hide right and that's why we called it the great unwind everything except crypto i think is really gonna be impacted and if we're even partly right that bond yields are going to go to five percent or higher you know obviously crushes bond prices but it has to impact stocks and real estate and anything else that has a discounted cash flow and so i think for a normal investor that's looking at all the kind of normal asset classes like stocks bonds you know real estate whatever and cryptocurrencies you know and it might take another few months maybe they're gonna just say hey if we have money to put to work you know we just it's hard to imagine putting it to work and in these other things and crypto should be completely disconnected from interest rates right there really isn't any reason that you know a utility token like bitcoin should really care if rates are zero five ten percent really i don't see why it should matter so i do think they will decouple which is you know a story we've been all talking about for a decade and uh the reality is bitcoin's typically not correlated with everything else but it does get really correlated in these stress moments when the s p comes off you know a big bunch so i think that the macro story ultimately be seen as is hugely positive for crypto and again i i'll admit i've been very surprised that uh crypto hasn't done as well uh so far this year as as i would have imagined and even you know one of the points you raised which is a you know it's an important one it's a confusing one is the russian invasion of the ukraine and then all of the policy responses you know it's hard it's hard to really know how everything's going to play out uh and obviously it's a huge international or a humanitarian uh catastrophe but it seems like when the dust clears it's it's probably going to make more people want to use crypto and i'm not saying that just from uh from both sides basically individual citizens who uh like they didn't get to vote on whether you know russian citizens didn't get to vote on whether to invade ukraine uh and so there's gonna be a lot more people around the world that are gonna insulate themselves from their own dictators you know uh bad decisions so individual citizens are going to want to own more crypto and then governments are going to want to own assets that are not controlled by kind of central you know payment rails like any kind of treasury would be or u.s dollar uh and so you know in the old days they buy gold right because the you know the nazis try to put a bunch of gold bricks on a japanese sub and send it to argentina and stuff you know so you know you know old school things like gold you know are obviously not connected to the the payment rails of the west but man crypto is living in the cloud right like it it's it's a way and so i i would have said uh before the war that it'd probably take maybe five more years for a central bank to buy bitcoin i think it's me in the next couple years you know and once the first one does i think a lot are gonna do it and and i'm not saying everybody's gonna sell all their dollars and go 100 bitcoin but um you know global fx reserves being five percent bitcoin in 10 years i mean i think that could easily happen and again those are big numbers so and that's why blockchain's such an amazing trade all the the tams you know the total addressable markets are all so you know stupidly big so uh i do i do think you know it's probably going to be in hindsight when we look back it's probably going to have been seen as a a catalyst for more people you know kind of thinking through the concept of the separation of money and state right like we're just all used to oh money has to be issued by our government and not not really you know like uh computer programs can issue money too and you know bitcoin's only been around for 13 years and ethereum for you know uh seven or whatever you know so it's not forever and gold's been around for five 000 so you know gold's got a long track record but i think the tide's changing the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life a cross is the

have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto yeah the tide is certainly changing and uh one of the the lines that we frequently say on bank list is that as the world becomes more and make more and more chaotic uh the the volatility and chaos of the crypto world just seems less by comparison and all of a sudden like just the use cases just are illuminated uh when the federal reserve and a bunch of money printing happens or like you said uh the no no russian citizen voted for the invasion of ukraine causing a collapse in the ruble their their money that they store their value in so all of a sudden the threshold for a lot of the people of the world for understanding why they might be interested in crypto becomes a lot lower and that's bullish in of itself but i want to go back and just double click on on the decoupling between the interest rates and the crypto assets because i didn't totally fully wrap my head around that and so i wanted to ask that question one more time because everyone that i've heard previously is that rising interest rates is bad for risk on assets and what is a risk on asset if not for the whole entire crypto industry uh i i think it's i can go without saying that when the crypto markets are coupled to the equities markets or the macro markets it's generally to the bearish side and when it's decoupled it's to the bullish side why do you think we are decoupled now when we weren't previously if you do agree that we weren't previously like why are we decoupling and why can we have rising interest rates which we all see are coming yet still be bullish crypto yeah uh so it did just remind me i first visited the soviet union in 1990 right when gorbachev was doing his his opening his glass nose and i went to buy some books in the kremlin bookstore and tried to hand him rubles and they said no only us dollars and i'm like you guys are [ __ ] if you won't even accept your own currency the soviet union is over and like a year later they were toast so um you know so the decoupling story is uh historically in the last 11 years that we have data bitcoin has had a very high correlation with the s p 500 in the six big down spikes of the s p historically for 71 days on average and so that's my framework is that there's this kind of instinctual desire to like you say risk on risk off asset drop and it has historically worked in very short time periods but the reason i don't believe it has to work over long time periods is the whole concept of risk on risk off which i even heard chairman bernanke once used in his speech which is very wild that a very educated phd in the economics is talking about risk on risk off is the reason that happens is not because certain assets have any underlying reason to be correlated it's because the same people own the same stuff and i started out when hedge funds were called alts alternatives they're not alternative anymore everybody owns the same stuff right and so uh you know when somebody wants to sell bonds they also have to sell stocks they have to sell gold they have to sell every you know if if if an institutional investor is told by the boss you got to reduce risk by four percent or whatever they just sell stuff across the board and that's why things are correlated not because there's any economic reality to be the reason i'm still convinced that blockchain can have a very low correlation with everything else is most people don't own any of it right like most institutional investors really don't own a material amount of cryptocurrency assets so some of the biggest endowments maybe have one or two or three percent in in blockchain there's a lot that still owns zero you know most major insurance companies basically own zero and so that's how they can stay uncorrelated i think for the next say five years if we're right and blockchain is a really important thing and in time it becomes an asset class you know i think everyone will have like eight percent of their portfolio in blockchain so in 10 years you know blockchain will be as correlated with the s p as as you know anything else commodities or bonds or whatever but for now i really think it can be uncorrelated and one of my other thoughts that we did just put in the last investor letter is i think the cycles are going to be much more muted than they used to be so in my nine years of trading we've seen six bear markets i think and they averaged uh earlier 83 percent which you know that test test you're convicted you know so um that's the thing i don't think we'd have anymore i don't think we're gonna have any more 83 bear markets right i think that as more and more institutions come into the industry and very importantly invest for a much longer time frame than kind of you know most retail type people is i think we're now going to see bear markets that are something like 50 which in the real world would be catastrophic but in bitcoin that's shallow and that'd be really nice so uh i think the the bringing in institutions will ultimately over time increase the correlation with the rest of the asset classes uh but will uh mute the amplitude of the these swings and then the the big thing is uh like you said uh about the uncertainty and the chaos in the world i think we've been so used to just dampening volatility dampening uncertainty everything and even the fed predicts where they're gonna be two years from now that i don't know where i'll be next week right like it's so crazy to be trying to say what your policy is going to be two years from now that literally is going to be all blown up the whole forward guidance thing six months from now you'll never hear that word again that's over that's such a crazy concept and so unfortunately i think they've injected a lot of uncertainty and if rates have to rise to five percent or more like i think wow i don't even know what all the impacts are gonna be there's gonna be a lot of weird things happen uh and that's why we call it the great unwind like as you do a rate move that hasn't happened in 40 years you're gonna expose strange leverages that people didn't know about or you know so i think there's gonna be a lot of volatility and like you said as crypto becomes less volatile and everything else gets crazy volatile crypto's not going to look as weird anymore like it used to look really scary because you know hey there was a year i think it was 2020. the biggest draw down the s p 500 was 2.3 percent like literally peak to trough it never went down by more than 2.3 percent which so why not just keep putting more money in equities right like if you're a retail person and you or an institution and you just put your money in and the worst time you ever have is you're down 2.3 percent and on average you go up 20 every year you just keep buying more of it and the same thing with houses right as they always go up and they're going up 19 you buy more of it if stuff starts getting squirrely here which i think it will people realize that you know crypto is not that scary and here's a cool factoid for your your uh listeners although bitcoins had all those crazy bear markets there's only one calendar year printed in new low in the last 11 years like even though it went down to 83 it ended up higher than it started and so even though crypto has this vision of being so crazy and so many bear markets and nuclear winters and all this stuff there's only one calendar year where it printed a new low and so it's crypto isn't as wild as some of these other things in reality and then i think the other things are going to get kind of strange it's kind of crazy it's like it's only volatile if you sell like come on guys right it's like just buy and hold and dollar cost average in if if you need to across all of these years and it's basically been up only uh and so dan just to zoom in on that though i think you said in your most recent um letter is i think we're done with the bear market negative 50 and we're on to a new rally and you're talking about the bear market in crypto the next six to 12 months are likely to see massive rallies investors flee stocks bonds and real estate for blockchains so that's what you've just been describing but are you calling the bear market over i mean some people this is their first cycle in crypto and they're like oh my god it's a bear market and it's going to be down do you think the the bear market is over i do i really do that you know we've gone through these cycles um where uh you know it's typically like 150 days or so of bear market and then the bull markets have been like 300 days so the bear markets are half as long as the bull markets and this one's been 107 days or something to the low um we often hit lows kind of after big rally years and before tax day and so all those things are just intuitions that it feels like we've done uh as much and uh like dave said we we've had some big news you know fed going from crazy accommodative to now tightening you know a war some some big things have happened and we've kind of digested that i don't know what else could come out that's crazier than that right like the fed going from 40 years of cutting rates to five years or whatever of increasing is big news and now that we've digested that i think we have seen a base also you know to the extent there's leverage in the system it gets cleaned out after a down 50 move so you know anybody that needs to sell has sold and so i do think the low we had in february i guess you know is it um and it's time to get going uh a couple of other points on the stability of crypto anybody that's held bitcoin for just over three years has always made money and you know uh pass doesn't guarantee to predict the future but like i'm willing to bet it'll keep going for a while so you know crypto's less scary than people think and and yeah i really want to emphasize to your new investors out there really just put as much in as you can hold down like 80 and still like have your spouse like you uh is what you should put in crypto and then just hold it and it's gonna go up it's gonna go down uh but yeah you gotta have like a five to ten review and you can't be like day trading you never wanna be forced to sell it that's for that's for sure uh yeah so okay so we've talked we've talked about um what what's happening and now we're just kind of concluding how to prepare but it feels like dan the answer to this is is definitely like don't be buying bonds be worried about bonds if you have those in your portfolio you'd be very worried it sounds like you're actually doing some trading where i don't know if you're shorting bonds or sort of what but then the the other answer is uh buy crypto and so listeners are gonna be like oh a crypto podcast telling you like crypto is a fantastic asset class but like honestly dan is it really that simple is that what like we should do to prepare again none of this is financial advice uh of course but like your perspective on this is is it really that simple or although i asked alternatively is this what crypto has been preparing for its entire life yeah so so here's one last little tip in case anybody wants it i i did invest in buy a etf called tbt that is two times short the 20-year bond market and so if anybody actually does want to get short that is a very convenient way to do it so in the in the crypto market yeah it's a crypto podcast and i'm a crypto investor so yeah buy crypto is what you would think somebody would say and what what i i want to put some perspective in that is that you know i have been doing this for nine years and there have been some kind of dangerous times of my crypto and some great times to buy crypto and so uh i would say this is way more the great time to buy crypto rather than a dangerous time and so some of the yardsticks i would use is um on average crypto i'll use bitcoin as a proxy for the industry just because everybody knows those prices on average bitcoin has gone up 10x every two years for 11 years right and so it really it so it has a log growth rate of 145 a year so it goes up 2.5 x every year and goes up 10x every two years so if you take that as kind of something that always at least for a while can keep happening we are way behind that pace and to put in perspective is you know bitcoin's basically double where it was four and a half years ago which rarely ever happens where you can buy bitcoin at only twice where it was you know a long long time ago and then the price of bitcoin today is about i think it's 55 right now cheat to that long-term trend and again these are just yardsticks uh for you know value it's it doesn't prove it's going to go up in the next 27 minutes or whatever but it just feels like today is definitely not a stupid time to buy a crypto uh because it's it's relatively cheap uh it's half of where it was you know a few months ago um which was right on its trend and you know so it feels like it's a better time than most but again you know i think people should be buying and holding and you know only putting in an amount they could afford to lose you know most of if it if it all goes sideways for a while can i ask if you uh agree with this because like you know i guess maybe you know a crypto podcast we're saying we're talking about like crypto and how it's an amazing asset class right but it's not like we've only been doing this for like two years okay like so i feel like the crypto community has largely culled what is happening now for the last decade at least and you've been in this space for approaching a decade i know you pivoted pantera it was not a crypto fund but you pivoted completely to crypto in 2013 i believe because you were seeing what was happening what was going to happen in the future now it's the 2020s where crypto people are calling for like hey this money printing is not going to end well everyone and it's not showing up in inflation but we're seeing inflation in asset prices and now we're showing like i you know maybe people wouldn't ever criticize the crypto community for for being humble but i think we can like be confident about this right we've called it right for the past 10 years haven't we and so uh it's not like a bunch of crypto guys who have no track record can you tell can you tell us a little bit about that about like the last 10 years and kind of your calls and maybe back to your original decision of why you decided to pivot pantera into crypto in the first place is this what you expected would happen you know i have to say that as an industry we should be proud of ourselves it's pretty much what we were calling the whole time and it keeps happening and all the skeptics are always like saying that you know the negative stuff i'm just like you know i don't know i think this is um i think i've seen this movie before i i think i know where it's going and web 3 is like the most obvious trade i've ever seen it will definitely happen like there's no no doubt and so uh my history was uh prior to this i was at tiger management and focus on very asymmetric um trades around the world looking at interesting things and like i said i went to the soviet union in the early 90s to invest in gazprom and you know some other privatizations and things and so every few years a trade like that would come up you know argentine farmland or middle east equities or whatever and the key is always looking for trades where the upsides way more than the downside and uh i just put in our last investor later that the the prior trade we did to to bitcoin was investing in tesla motors i had dinner with one of the founders of tesla and he told me about this electric car and i was so jazzed up about it because uh for a lot of reasons i thought it'd be very successful and then uh pantera's chief economist has got iran glance and he was a partner of mine at tiger and he used to be the uh number one auto analyst in the united states and so i got him to help me on it he was super negative and he was talking about all these tesla fanboys and blah blah white it's a dumb idea and his line which is pretty amazing which and it's true he's like hey the last car company to go public is ford motor company oh that's bad right all the other ones have gone bankrupt every you know delorean you know dee tommaso with their pantera and you know all these guys have tried to build car crash always failed and so he was super negative we did a ton of work on it and i just came to the conclusion that you know the the auto industry and even the dealership model that's just super crazy how that's built in the future obviously is electric and solar and everything uh and so we so we did that trade and the cool the reason i mentioned the cool irony is in the early part we're all of 2013. both bitcoin and tesla traded the same dollar price per share so when when bitcoin is 40 bucks a share tesla's 40 bucks when bitcoin is 90. and so during that period i was uh investigating um bitcoin uh my my friends pete berger and mike novogratz the fortress you know asked me to help him think about it and um i had a bit of knowledge because my brother uh who's an aerospace engineer he had gotten some free bitcoins from the bitcoin faucet which your young viewers wouldn't understand this they were giving away free bitcoins because nobody knew about it nobody dropped for it for doing the first day so funny and so he told me about it and i kind of have a little bit of libertarian streak so i read about it and there wasn't much you could read uh but you know i read about i was like you know that'd be awesome i hope it happens but i didn't really do anything uh about it and then uh when pete mike asked me to help think about it i came in for coffee and it lasted like six hours i was like oh man there's something huge going on and it took about four or five months to really you know think it through but i came to believe that it was gonna be one of those asymmetric trades right obviously a lot of ways it could go wrong but if it worked you know you could you could make not four or five times your money but like ten times your money maybe a hundred times your money or maybe a thousand times your money uh and actually that's the funny thing is the first price forecast that our in our first memo was a thousand x you know that i thought it'd go to five thousand dollars per bitcoin and so uh it is fun to go back and read those old memos because they're still right like um i was just i did a uh i did an interview with bill miller famous you know um uh value investor and he was talking about how you know sometimes people say hey you know bitcoin's stupid it's just like buying gold and like and this was the line from that first memo nine years ago was like no it's like buying gold in a thousand bc is what it's like like gold was great for a while but now everybody has it and still not that many people have bitcoin so bitcoin's still early and and then it's going to transform almost everything there's some things that won't transform but blockchain you know it's going to transfer most businesses definitely everything financial you know is going to be done on some kind of blockchain uh voting rights you know refugee aid like just so many things are gonna transition to a decentralized digital version that the upside is still just enormous you know although the industry's done well you know it's still tiny compared to the rest of the world you know uh d5 is great because it's a 250 billion now there's 120 trillion bonds right like so there's 500 x to go uh and one of the cool ways to think about it's like new technologies don't just kind of replace the market cap of the previous thing like the value of amazon is greater than the value of every little mom and pop bookstore in 1995 right so bitcoin and blockchain d5 still being 1 500 of the bond market like it could easily do all that 500 x plus more or whatever so you know that's why i'm still so bullish that it's still so so early can i ask you this so uh because you probably hang out in these circles much more than uh david and myself and most bankless listeners uh what about the institutional appetite all right are they finally understanding this are they starting to see like crypto like what are they what are the conversations that uh we never get to hear in these like institutional corners where they're debating uh crypto and debating this asset class are they on board yet or they still think it's like you know drug money and you know the ponzi schemes yeah so that that's a great question that people want to ask for a long time the answer is i think right now it's changing like literally right now and if you think back uh in the early days i went and pitched all the biggest endowments and you'd get the cio and like 20 people in a room and you'd go in and you know you do the show but in retrospect it was a total waste of time right because there was only one fund manager in the industry we only had one fund and that fund only had one asset bitcoin that is a terrible thing for an asset allocator right like putting all the downside on them and i was honest at the time i was like hey you could lose all your money but you know you might make like 50 times your money and uh that doesn't sell that doesn't sell so no one took you up on that no endowment at all like not at all and and then the funny thing is it it went up 600 x right like so it would have been an insane trade to put just a tiny tiny fraction of their assets in there but it's terrible from like a career management standpoint like you know because it could have gone to zero and i was you know very frank that it could have uh but the funny bit would be you get kind of the end of the meeting and you're just you're feeling nothing happening like is nobody's gonna invest in your fun but you know they're walking out to the elevator and everybody's like what's the minimum you know because they all want to invest personally but there's no way they would put you know xyz universities endowment in it and so a lot of them and did invest personally and now you know many are invested professionally but uh what i would say is even up until a couple of years ago there was a long list of fake reasons to not invest you know oh it's didn't a silk road guy use bitcoin or where you know so there was a bunch of those and and um uh we did put a list uh last year in a letter of all the reasons people used to say no there's no custodian it's a fraud you know all this stuff and so luckily almost all those you know got crossed out and really the only one i would say left is regulatory risk and it's really almost uniquely the sec in the united states so there's only really one kind of unknowable anymore and in that i think it's a small one but the the the point of the story is there used to be you know like custody was a very you know obvious uh excuse or reason to not invest you know but now we have you know fidelity and coinbase and you know bitco and all these uh big custodians so uh all most of those have gone away you still hear you know some of the kind of negative you know occasionally people in my heart i always think it's an excuse for why they're not yet long i don't think it's a very deeply held intellectual belief and and that's one thing for a challenge for your listeners is if anybody knows of a well-written paper that's negative on crypto i would love to read it and and i'm not talking about like just warren buffett going oh it's rat poison or something i'm talking about somebody who actually writes down a couple paragraphs and you know oh and i think look that's a call that um if there's a good negative crypto critic we'd love to have them on the podcast as well yeah i'd like to hear that because i'm drinking the kool-aid and i'd love to hear the other side right like if a smart person wants to argue the other side i'd love to hear it but the crypto bowl case for that is anyone who can articulate a negative opinion or a negative case for crypto can't really do it because they just become bullish they own some yeah no they just they just kill themselves we i had a i had a fun conversation with one of the rarest animals on earth a person who's supposedly smart and negative on crypto and there's only a handful out there and this guy's a professor at johns hopkins and um it was on c and n back when you actually went to studios and it was real so on the way to the studio i was reading one of his research pieces and he said bitcoin the pets.com of our era and i'm like oh that's hysterical and so when we got on the show you know i asked him a trivia question that almost nobody ever knows the answer to is who's the dope who is the majority owner of pets.com the poster boy of terrible investments in the dot com boom nobody ever knows that but it's this guy who thought the internet was going to be disruptive and that maybe you'd be able to sell canned pet food on the internet which we all know that was a dumb idea but uh books worked and jeff bezos is doing fine even though he was the owner of pets.com and so as i said to this guy he's the last name of wadwani that bitcoin and all these cryptos are like that is like i don't know i wouldn't bet 100 of my life savings on one particular cryptocurrency you should own a basket of 30 40 different really interesting projects and if one goes to zero that's gonna happen right like that's totally cool but as long as you're in you know a basket of these really important protocols you're gonna do great and so even a person who's supposedly smart in writing papers that's negative on crypto even got his whole model wrong that like it is like pets.com you should be buying a bunch of different crypto protocols and you know some are going to be very important but by the way is that your overall take just like the easy button is like sort of like a bitcoin ether and then an index of a bunch of other crypto assets is kind of the easy button portfolio or how would you describe an easy button portfolio for exposure here yeah unfortunately it's not as easy as it used to be really is the sad answer if we wanted a quick quick answer is uh obviously bitcoin is everything for a long time and it's great just tell people you know buy some bitcoin and then for a long time i was like hey buy half eth half bitcoin and you're gonna be fine um the world's way more complicated than that now uh and so the the kind of theoretical answer and obviously it's not super pragmatic for all your listeners but is to be invested in a lot of different things and um it's we we probably invested 200 different things across all of our funds so uh that is the reality is that there are going to be probably 10 or so really important layer one block chains and then uh you know all this as your listeners know but the sec chairman doesn't all the other things are actually just kind of companies basically built on top of other protocols and uh there is a great line that uh the chairman of the sec said four or five months ago that we don't need 5 000 new private monies you know and um used some examples about the continental era of the us where we had different colonial dollars and you know and then we got one dollar and it was all great and and i think he and lots of people misunderstand it there aren't five thousand layer one blockchains right like there just aren't there's ten or so that are important and then almost all the rest of those are just protocol uh applications built on somebody else's protocol and the us has 4 500 public companies so i have no problem with 4 500 tokens right that that we're not there yet there aren't 4 500 real tokens yet but in 10 years there will be and so the punchline of all that is a portfolio should be you know many things you know more than just one or two things um and you know one of the things i think about when i talk to institutional investors is i sometimes find myself in these meetings where they just keep kind of drilling it like but which protocols can be the winner you know and is it going to be poked eyes would be ethereum you know just really really just can't kind of can't just accept that i actually don't know you know i there's there's a lot of interesting ones right there's going to be there and it it the analog to try and use with them is like when they're interviewing an equity manager they don't sit there and say hey i'm not going to invest a dime until you convince me which one company is going to take over the entire world because that's how i want to invest in stocks and that's not the way people should invest in crypto it's like um you know you invest in a portfolio and the manager you know buys a bunch of different things and so the theoretical answer is to invest in a broad portfolio of things um because there are a lot of things going on like for example uh last year bitcoin was up 70 and our uh liquid token fund was up 325 you know there's just a lot of things going on one of which is bitcoin but there's you know 30 other important things in the liquid side and there's you know 80 or whatever in the private uh token side of our portfolio so uh for those that can investing in a fund manager like ourselves there's a bunch of great you know managers in the space is probably now better than the old days when i said hey just buy some bitcoin at eight you're probably fine uh you know these days i think you do need you know a broader exposure oh there's a ticker uh i think it's called dpi that has the d5 you know like 10 top d5 you know something like that is a great way to get more than just one thing totally certainly because you certainly hate to have gotten crypto right invested some money crypto happens and then you're in the myspace of you're all over whatever like yeah yeah exactly dan we've been focusing this uh conversation mo generally mostly from the outside in about crypto the macro side of crypto and then the broad strokes but uh as we just wrap this up and i want to ask you kind of just the the internal side what themes then what thematic themes that you're paying attention to in the crypto industry moving forward in 2022 and beyond like what really captures your attention is it layer two ecosystems is it daos uh is it defy like is it the nft side of things like what are the many many themes that have emerged in the last 12 months or so that have really captivated your attention yes and that's why i'm so excited about crypto is there's so many super important things everything you mentioned there is something that is very important and that we're uh working hard on and investing in and so um although that sounds overwhelming those that's totally different than two years ago like half the things you just mentioned didn't even exist two years ago and so totally uh that's why i like crypto that it it's always changing uh but so definitely layer twos roll-ups scalability is coming on now like there's a lot of projects like arbitrary and starkware that are really important and obviously have to happen um you know when there was only a couple of uh you know crypto enthusiasts using bitcoin or ethereum it didn't matter that it only did turn 10 transactions per second but if a billion of us all want to you know do some video gaming at the same time it's not going to work right so scaling is massively important um so for a long time we were pretty much focused on just two blockchains uh three uh bitcoin eth and then were investors equity investors in ripple so we were focused on those three and that kind of did cover it for a long time and but now there's a lot of interesting um layer ones out there solana tara and near there's a bunch of things out there that are important for their own use cases because there are different use cases now not just storing digital gold right you know bitcoin's really good at that um the other one i just honestly i said this before web 3 it's the most obvious trade i've ever seen in my life and we might mess up and invest in the wrong projects or whatever but like 10 years from now we are not going to have these big centralized data monopolies sucking all the value out of our lives right and the other thing they're not going to be doing is governing our lives that's so important i don't think probably people talk enough about it that there's a lot of a lot of bad stuff after these very centralized data monopolies that just won't happen in the long run and again it's going to take 10 years or whatever so web3 uh massively important and i think probably it's going to have the biggest impact on our lives right like kind of the number of people out there uh and then um nfts is a fascinating you know sector that a new art form is being created just like you know each of the last you know 50 years has had its new art form um and then the whole concept dowse of letting people actually govern themselves is superior to the representative democracy and definitely superior monarchies and dictators right so i'm a huge fan of the constitution dow and people say oh it failed i'm like no no it's massively successful in the end ken griffin had a few more dollars than they had and so he won that particular bidding but it took ken griffin 30 years to accumulate that money and took the constitution down like a week that's massive and they went out with the best tweet ever their last tweet was how much for citadel and to my mind that is such a great way to encapsulate how the world's changing is like we used to have centralized things like you know uh citadel which i have nothing against ken griffin any of those people but centralized things where one or two humans controls an enormous amount of power and you know ten years from now we're going to have you know entities that are democracy's going to control and the citizens are going to actually get to do things and and so i'm i'm really excited about that i think uh and another thing that i don't think people think enough about is satoshi gifted to the world one of the most important things of all time right like in 20 years when we look back it's gonna blow people's minds that satoshi just handed this thing no patents didn't take any money uh it's pretty wild and i think it's i think within five years a billion people use bitcoin or you know crypto and maybe even three years honestly it's happening so fast and that's that's really cool to be involved something it's going to touch a billion people's lives it is really cool we are at the i think the right place at the right time in history and even though there's a bond bubble and a great unwinding ahead i think with crypto there's maybe a light at the end of the tunnel here and how a civilization and society reorganizes on the other side of this and that's certainly reason for optimism so so dan you've uh led us through some dark corners some some i guess obscure things that not a lot of people understand and you've painted the picture of um you
