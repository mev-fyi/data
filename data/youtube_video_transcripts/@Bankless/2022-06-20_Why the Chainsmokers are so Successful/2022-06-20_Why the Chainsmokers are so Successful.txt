but for us i think you know we always challenge ourselves and push ourselves and that's kind of what's motivated us to work super hard we've branched out into tequila business the tv and film business which is easily the hardest business out there and venture now and every time we kind of decide to take something on we are super self-aware about how challenging it's going to be to get to the next level just like venture like the music is like a hitch-driven business you know what i mean on some levels people say you're only as good as your last hit and i feel like that's something we've continued to do is just bet on ourselves after we had that song selfie which is its own book in itself we got dropped by republic records after that why like why were people were people i mean i think they and i don't blame them i think they expected us to be like a lmfao type group that will release like all these kind of selfie type songs and we were like hell no that was never that song we made in 20 minutes that was just a joke we got dropped which is like the end of most artists careers at that point in time and we kind of just said like i believe in the music we have coming and that's when we made roses we make some bold decisions but the bottom line's always like let's just bet on ourselves
