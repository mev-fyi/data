people probably have concerns about facebook being big brother or something and like the privacy concerns and i think mark smart he gets that they're making it so you don't need to sign into oculus with your facebook account and that kind of stuff but the reason why i think it's smart is that number one of course facebook because it's a social media company and it's disrupted so many business models and you know it's a mirror of society both the good and the bad and so you know they have all this pressure about d platforming and people think they messed up the elections so they're basically their brand has just been getting so much hate so he's kind of now saying hey facebook is not just the blue app whatever that you hate it's also whatsapp it's also oculus it's also you know instagram and these other things and so i think it's a great move for him just to rebrand and say that the parent company is now about something bigger to get rid of the hate i also think it's a brilliant move because vr and ar i think is the future of computing
