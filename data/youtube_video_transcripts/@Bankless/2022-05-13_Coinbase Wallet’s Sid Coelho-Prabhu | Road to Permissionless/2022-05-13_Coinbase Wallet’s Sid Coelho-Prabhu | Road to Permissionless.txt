welcome bankless nation to the road to permissionless permissionless of course is the biggest defy metaverse institutional crypto event of the year it's happening in west palm beach florida may 17th to 19th and the road to permission list is these special bankless episodes some extra content where we hype some of the companies and projects that are coming with us to the permissionless conference today on the show we are talking to sid koilu prabhu who's working on the coinbase wallet side of things and wallets of course are useful things to have at conferences so if you are a first-time conference goer or you have not settled on which is your preferred mobile wallet to take around the world with you perhaps this one is for you if you guys are looking for more bankless content of course maybe you should come to permissionless as well this is going to be a reunion of all of the hottest bankless podcasts that you know and love chris dixon has a keynote speech there justin drake is both on a panel that i'm moderating and also moderating and panel in of himself cooper turley is coming jay from rory vance spencer carly reid from overpriced jpegs and of course from the coinbase side of things sirochit the chief product officer at coinbase and sanchin from the nft platform all of these content all these bits of content which you know you want out of what the hell is going on in the black box that is coinbase so we try to illuminate that a little bit of that that answer here on today's episode but also with some of the content going on at permissionless if you are a

around the web3 ecosystem let's go ahead and get right into the show with sid from coinbase wallet welcome bankless nation to this episode of the road to permissionless on today's episode we're speaking with sid coilo prabhu from the coinbase wallet team and you know wallets are something that everyone needs when they go to conferences because it's how you do your crypto things out and about and so we're going to talk about permissionless we're going to talk about coinbase wallet and all of the the mountain of stuff that's going on beneath the scene with coinbase wallet and how your conference life your confidence experience might be aided by having a nice mobile wallet like perhaps the one at coinbase wall so sid welcome to the show welcome to the road to permissionless thanks for having me super excited to be here and pump for the conference yeah no the conference is going to be great uh there's going to be a lot of things to do at the conference the the nft section of the conference where people are going to be able to tinker with nfts and talk to nft collectors and actually collect some things like i said in the in the intro would be advantageous to have a mobile wallet uh but you know when people think about coinbase they typically think the centralized exchange right like you know it's where it's the on-ramps it's the trading um but uh one of the most under discussed things in the coinbase ecosystem i think is the coinbase wallet both which is a mobile app and also a browser extension uh so sid can you kind of just like illuminate what's been going on behind the scenes on the wallet side of things outside of coinbase sure yeah and it's it's funny you know we we spend a lot of time on crypto twitter right and i think amongst the early adopters they all started with the first generation of wallets that were that were out there and those you know power user wallets and you know i have a lot of appreciation for the work those wallets have done but we've we've been actually working quite a bit on the next generation of adopters and so uh most people don't know this but coinbase wallet is actually the number one most downloaded wallet in the us and i think we have the fastest growing extension now which we launched uh recently so kind of almost under the radar outside of the the core crypto ecosystem we've we've been growing and building wallet for for quite a while now and so yeah maybe i should tell you about the origin story because it didn't even start off his coinbase wallet right no i remember it it was it was a coinbase wallet is blue but it uh the it used to be the toshi wallet which was green i remember using toshi wall before it got acquired by coinbase it was one of my first mobile wallets so yeah walk us through the genesis walk us through the back story of how coinbase wallet came to be and its trajectory and timeline so far yeah for sure so so you were right it was toshi the funny thing is it was not an acquisition and so people often think it was an acquisition that i was a little bit by design where you know the this is thick back circa 2017 and it was actually brian armstrong side project so if you think back to then you know he had built what was probably the world's leading centralized exchange and i think you probably found it a bit limiting right so i was also there helping to launch it and and you know when you work with centralized exchange it's like which countries you can operate in which assets you can support uh which users you can offer the product to all of that there's a lot of controls and boundaries and and it feels that you know we're all crypto nerds at coinbase right like we've read the white paper we believe in economic freedom and and some of this felt kind of against the the spirit and at odds with the spirit of crypto and decentralization and so simultaneously also in 2017 i think ethereum was starting to rise right so amongst early adopters uh they were starting to play around with ethereum and it became apparent to us that the future of crypto might be around like these new permissionless apps and there weren't any at the point but you could see how people were building them and so we started experimenting with it and we said hey we could actually build something that's you know uh like the wechat super app right where you go there and you can find all these different apps and services but imagine if you had something like that for crypto so all these new crypto super apps not yet built soon to be built so we we we built this product and we we called it something different than coinbase because we weren't certain about this new ecosystem and so we branded it completely differently then we launched and coincidentally the same week that we launched was when crypto kitties blew up if you remember like i think december 2017 and uh you know almost took down ethereum with it because of all the gas prices and everything and that's when we we instantly got that validation right i think we were the first wallet to support cryptokitties on mobile and that's when we realized hey there's actually something here and so so that's it that was the beginning that was toshi uh soon about a year i do just want to highlight how much it wasn't a consensus bet to bet on permissionless financial applications because there weren't many at that time in 2016 2017 like cryptokitties was one of the first ones but like there was no defy we did not have the d5 word there was no uniswap there was no make or dao and so like it's taking a bet on the a wallet a browser wallet browser-like wallet that would exist in your phone that would access some of these not yet built apps was not intuitive at all uh and so it was actually like way ahead of its time back in the early days before like before we get to the point now where like there's many many many wallets so you know 0.4 for coinbase being way of ahead of his time with the whole coinbase wallet thing yeah and you know props to brian for seeing that right and especially for someone who had worked on the centralized side i think he saw those limitations and the opportunity that that ethereum presented at that point in time and uh yeah and so then the rest is history so we've been building this uh we we like to think of us our role as onboarding the mainstream and so you know what coinbase does best is we really focus on making things simple we're a brand based on trust and so we've been working really hard to make your onboarding into web3 really really easy uh make it easy for you to fund your wallet make it easy for you to learn what you can do with web3 and yeah so as a result of that we've been pretty happy to see uh like a lot of success both on mobile and the extension that we launched uh late last year yeah and the uh being able to be free from the like the shackles of a centralized exchange probably is really really enticing from both the product standpoint but also also with the users before we go into like the properties and characteristics of the uh coinbase wallet you mentioned it was the most downloaded wallet in all of crypto how do you think that uh the coinbase wallet has gotten such strong numbers do you think it's just like the coinbase legitimacy and coinbase trusts or like where do you where do all those downloads come from yeah so i think so so typically we're the most downloaded wallet in the us and then we've got i think there's other competitors in in the in the emerging markets that are doing great and we've got some ground to catch up there and i think it is it's a couple of things i think it's a the the brand of coinbase the trust that people associate with it b we have 89 million users on the main coinbase app that when they're looking to graduate into web 3 their first choice is a coin based product uh and the third is just the work that i think the product engine design teams have been doing to make the experience like easy and simple right so we we don't target uh at least not not so far we haven't been targeting like hardcore djinns we've been focused on a user that wants to get started in web 3 and make it easy for them to get started yeah and that is a certainly a very very tall order uh i could imagine like getting uh onboarding people off in off of a centralized exchange where like they're used to uh having a custodian used to just like the normal web uh email password login and then getting it into self custody is a bit of a hurdle so we'll talk about the design decisions that you've that you guys have put into coinbase wall to make this uh just an easier place for newbies to go but i also just want to zoom out and just talk about the highest level properties of the coinbase wallet like uh custodial custodial non-custodial d5 support nft support like what are the just the big overarching characteristics of the coinbase wallet yeah sure happy to cover those so we we see ourselves as the gateway to web3 and the the two goals that we have uh access to everything that users want and really making it simple so firstly one wallet for all your assets right so not only do we support ethereum and all the popular evm chains right so we support polygon avalanche optimism phantom arbitrim uh but then there's a difference in terms of how we support it so if you look at other mainstream wallets you've got to go and fiddle around with json rpcs you've got to manually add tokens and we didn't want any of that for our users so for the top networks they just work if you add a polygon asset on nft it just shows up you don't have to you don't have to think twice so someone who's onboarding onto this next generation blockchain it'll just work and it's all a unified balance so you're not you know going to some network menu and switching networks and everything it's just all in one beautiful unified balance and then going beyond even evm we support all the other top channels so you know we've supported bitcoin from very near the beginning so that's you know another huge like self-custody ecosystem and then we're in the process we we recently added support for solana which is you know another non-evm chain that's that's getting quite a bit of uh popularity and we're adding support for solana dapps and nfts and d5 uh in the coming months and so what you have as a user is you want to access web3 you're not you're kind of like agnostic as to what chain it's on and we just make that really simple for you so that's one area we've invested quite a bit in uh the rest is in nft so you know nfts are probably one of the most popular use cases in coinbase wallet uh and for most of web3 and once again we want to take a slightly different approach so you know most of the wallets out there they haven't had a chance to really build their own infrastructure and so they are rate limited by these third-party apis that they're using so whichever wallet you're using often you'll buy an nft and it doesn't show up for like 30 minutes and that's because of these dependencies so we invested in building our own indexer and now if you buy an nft it'll probably just show up in you know as soon as the block is processed a few seconds later it'll show up so it's the little things even there with our nft support in d5 this week actually we're pretty pretty excited in the next week or so we'll be rolling out support for viewing all your d5 balances so we're going to start with ethereum and you know if you're a dj and you have balances in curve and compound or you know any any uh popular protocol out there it's going to show up so one one kind of master balance across your d5 your crypto your nfts uh we also have seamless on-ramps right i mentioned we have 89 million users on coinbase if you're a coinbase user graduating into self-custody and web3 you can connect your account in like two clicks and you can either transfer your assets and remember coinbase has something like 280 billion dollars of assets under custody or you can buy assets with your connected bank account or credit card and we make that really simple uh and then what else this so we've been shipping so much recently uh we recently added hardware wallet support if you use ledger uh we have dex trading on all the popular uh chains that we support so yeah that's just a a handful of the different uh features that we have on on wallet yeah and this this is just such an insanely ambitious project because you gotta integrate all of the blockchains many are evm but many aren't uh you gotta integrate all of the applications which each one of each application represents its own beast to tackle then there's like the nft experience which is cumbersome which you guys are working on making more seamless in the background which is its own it's its own beast then there's it's self-custody so there's no third-party custody provider so you have to manage like help people store their private keys we have the layer 2 ecosystem is coming and then bluetooth with a ledger is also crazy like it has so many moving parts and it does uh it is reminiscent of the super apps of the east more than it is the the the uh the single use apps of of the west it seems to be just like a one-stop shop for absolutely everything how big is the coinbase wallet team because there's there can't be anyone that's an expert in every single one of these elements right like how many how many people are working on the coinbase wallet project you know we've grown quite a bit i remember uh just about a year ago we were probably just 10 people and uh you know as a part of like overall at the company we we started to really not only see the action outside that was happening but also realize that you know our mission is to increase economic freedom and we realize that hey there's two big parts of this right like one is that self-custody itself is really important in order to like safeguard all of this innovation that's happening in order to provide access to all the innovation uh and and apart from just self-custody in web 3 all of this building is happening out in the ecosystem and so we realized that hey we've got to build these gateways and explore all of this ecosystem we we've grown the team quite a bit i you know i can't speak to the exact numbers now but we are hiring and so you know we we have a very ambitious roadmap ahead of us and uh we're hiring quite a bit so if anyone is interested uh you know reach me reach out to me on twitter or i'll see you at the conference okay yeah let's go ahead and get right into that what kind of talent are you really really looking for because again there's so many different aspects and angles to coinbase wallet i'm sure you guys are looking for protocol engineers but also business developers what what talent are you really looking to tap into and who are you looking to meet at permissionless yeah great great question so i would say there's probably three types of folks that that we're really excited about right so the first is uh folks that just love to build amazing products right i mean it's the one thing i think if you've used a coin based product i think we the one thing you know that comes away always hopefully is that we invest in making it a delightful experience and making a simple experience so anyone who comes even from a non-crypto background but you just obsess you want to build great experiences for people whether it's on you know as a product manager an engineer or a designer that's one one uh archetype of person that we want to pull in to improve the experience the second is anyone who wants to build very deeply technical crypto infrastructure so uh you know i mentioned some of the efforts we've done in terms of building our infrastructure these are really hard and challenging problems and the audience for it is millions of customs of coinbase customers so if you if you like really hard technical challenges reach out to me and then the third is like i said we we respect and honor the fact that builders in web 3 are what make this ecosystem great and we have an obligation at coinbase to lift up these builders and give them a platform and so if you like to do partnerships if you like to do community uh you like to do business development that's another type of person that we'd love to bring on the team fantastic and so uh it's a question for you how do you use your coinbase wallet like what do you use it for the most so so most i used to be i used to be super into d5 then d5 2.0 i got lost a little bit i was like okay this is this is a little too much even for me right and and these days i'm really exploring the nft space you know like uh buying an nft but also trying to explore what's the community that gets built around that nft and how can we start to bring some of those community ass related features into the wallet because you know you hold your nfts in the wallet but why why aren't you also able to see and get glimpses of that community that's building up around that around that project and and not have to go to say a chat forum or discordant and how can you really like engage with that community and see what other people are doing right from wallet and we're seeing other uh infrastructure also operate on with this as well like i think you can do chatting with specific nft owners through ether scan and a few other i think maybe in the loot or looks rare ecosystem as well but nowhere have i seen a chat function built into a wallet before especially with nfts being so incredibly social and something that we did see out of coinbase the the coinbase's nft platform is a lot of emphasis on social aspects like followers uh and and chatting and so like our is the the social media element of of the coinbase's nft platform also finding its way into the coinbase wallet well you know it is it is an area we find fascinating right i think you know david you've been around since the beginning you know like in the when you created a wallet in the beginning you got this 40 digit address right and that's all you got you got this number it's like getting a you know like a po box or something it me it meant nothing it was there's no human aspect it and now we're starting to understand that hey people actually bringing their whole persona their crafting online personas they're interacting with other people with these personas and what what does that look like and what is this next evolution so we're absolutely looking at these areas uh i don't know yet what's going to come out of it but the idea that like we're now forming identities online i think you know you're going to see a lot come out for from us at coinbase across the board not just in wallet uh and so i'm excited about that area and as we are building out our social lives a big part of that story is when you go to conferences at least with our crypto social lives when you go to conferences you're going to be bombarded with poe apps uh and so i always use my mobile wallets uh to to collect the poeps because like i don't i'm not gonna put them on my ledger i'm not going to carry my ledger around but i will carry my phone around of course and so having a mobile wallet to collect all the po apps is always just some good alpha for conference goers to have and so i would expect people to be downloading coinbase wall to collect the poe apps as they go throughout the conference are you guys gonna have a po-app for visiting the coinbase booth i will check with the team i hope we do i love to i personally love to collect those i remember like even going back to like you know eats denver like four years ago and getting the buffet gone i think that was one of the first ones and so i'm super excited about about that i hope we do one a question for how coinbase wallet integrates with the coinbase browser extension are these the same parts of the company or is this the same project yep the they're the exact same product just on two different platforms and so to you know like like i said we we spent three years building this mobile app we started to get like you know we got to the point where we were like you know doing really well number one number two position uh and then we realized that hey a lot of our users are on desktop and you know taking out your phone to scan the qr code it's like a little bit clunky especially if you use you know web3 is everywhere right like you spend half our day like you know doing some kind of interaction and so we said well what's the state of the art when it comes to the desktop and really you know there's some power user tools that we've been around for a long time but we said look we can make it so much better and so we said let's let's uh do a full redesign of what a browser extension should look like and we we actually shipped that very recently many people don't know about this we only shipped the first version in november kind of six months ago and we what we see now is we see people that are like hey let me check this out it's a coinbase product let me i'm curious about it and then they plug in their ledger or they you know transfer their keys over from another wallet and then they're like wait a minute this is my daily driver now because i i love it it's you know all the blockchains in one place the on-ramps from coinbase uh you know like all of the all the little touches the nfts i think that you know there's no other uh mainstream browser extension that has like great nft support so so we're seeing a lot of people start to adopt the the extension now and uh and this is before i think we have some of our most exciting features yet to come so and how are you guys doing on the uh like the integration front like there are some applications where you can only access them via metamask just because that's like the industry standard which is frustrating by the way because we need more than one ways to access defy apps how are you guys working on getting coinbase while integrated into the red the the defy apps where you have to go in in order to sign in you have to sign in with something uh how well is coinbase penetrating into that yeah great great question and i have to say we're in a very different place than we were a year ago and so you know we we made a couple of great like we built out our team we made a couple of great uh hires and we're now at a point where on ethereum at least any dap that you go to that you see uh an option to connect to metamask you will most likely see now an option to connect to coinbase wallet and that's across the extension across mobile uh in the future it might be other product coinbase products that can plug in via that coinbase connectivity option uh and now of course now we're reaching out to solana developers because we're going to be going live in the next couple of months and we're also you know we recently added support for bmb chain optimism arbitrary and polygon and in all of those ecosystems as well uh and you know when we talk to developers i think they see this opportunity where it's a they you know when a developer acquires a customer every developer is an entrepreneur and they're an entrepreneur for startup that's just gotten started right like most of these apps they're they're one one year old one month old they they work hard to bring a customer to their doorstep and to acquire that customer immediately they've got to hand that customer over to a wallet the job that that wallet does in onboarding that customer to crypto basically determines the funnel the conversion funnel for that that and so when we a we show the developers this experience that we've built with the extension with the mobile app and they're like wait this customer can install it they don't have to go to a different exchange anymore they can just buy crypto in like 10 seconds and get started with my dap and by the way this dap is going to have like on-ramps into this wallet has it on ramps into avalanche into polygon coming up in the next month that's amazing that that does wonders for my conversion and then the other thing they see is hey there's 90 million customers that coinbase can send my way and so they love that aspect as well so we've seen huge uh kind of very rapid adoption as we started to talk to developers about getting integrated nice wonderful wonderful one question i have about the coming future of crypto is a lot of the people are waiting for l222 to really get started and with the with the launch of optimism's token people are saying including myself uh that you know this is underway uh and coin with uh coinbase's design philosophy of just making a good uh app that people can that just works and has good ux but also in a multi-chain ecosystem that probably means abstracting away the bridges uh what's the strategy with with that because bridges are uh there's there's a lot of talk about like how secure are bridges which bridges are the most secure how do i get from point a to point b uh how are you guys thinking about this side of things with a coinbase wallet where uh bridges are complicated so we definitely need to abstract them but also we're abstracting away sometimes some risk from some users uh just it's a very complicated uh domain how are you guys thinking about this like coinbase wallet yeah great great question so firstly i feel the pain right like we we see i can tell you that we see customers that come into wallet new to crypto new to web3 and you know like i said it's our responsibility to onboard them they see the 50 sticker price for transaction and they they turn away and they're never coming back they've had a bad experience maybe they'll check it out next year so i think the first intervention that we need to do is just the on-ramp so imagine if you never have to touch a 50 chain again and you can just directly go to a roll-up for example or like an l2 and sure the the 50 chain is still powering the underlying infrastructure because it's a roll up but the onboarding experience for users that they never touch that that mainframe infrastructure that's my number one priority and i think you know we've already announced for example that uh we're bringing polygon on ramps live and that's that should be out shortly when that happens david i think you'll see this effect where everyone can now just onboard into crypto and buy that first nft or do that first dex trade and it cost sense and it took seconds that's that's very powerful the second is of course yes we're in a multi-chain world i think my i had a dream state i think two years ago that we'd all be on one roll up right and and it was a very naive vision it would have been great because then you only there's only one internet but now we're in a multiverse whether we like it or not there's at least five competing top solutions and you're right so the bridge is between them we're spending some time and we want to make that a very seamless native experience uh and so i hope to have more share in the coming months lovely lovely and uh the the whole potential of on-ramps directly onto the layer twos is something that the whole entire ethereum ecosystem is very very excited about and the potential of just like making very quick bridges from the millions of coinbase users to to l2s gets people really really excited um uh we we see that we read the tweets we know lovely lovely sydney you mentioned how you went to eat denver four years ago and so that i think that means that you are definitely a conference goer uh for people that have not yet been to a crypto conference before maybe this is their first time uh going to permissionless what advice do you have for the the first conference goer what should people pay attention to what should people be like which traps that people should avoid just any advice for the first first-timers out there yeah great question oh my god i still remember my first crypto conference it was the most amazing experience it's really something else first of all it's different than any other conference you know you go to other conferences and it's all these like boots and it's very formal and the crypto conference is so much fun and you know i think for me the number one is uh people right i feel like i've made some of my most productive relationships and friendships that i've enjoyed in the last four or five years in crypto at these conferences right i think you get to put a you get to put a face to all the posting you see on twitter right and and people you know you you get to make you the advice i'd give to people is you probably have something you want to get out of the conference you're either you're building something and you want funding or you want integrations uh or you maybe you want a job or you already have a product and it's a platform and you want to make partnerships you should go through the list of speakers of attendees in advance and kind of make that hit list of the people that you want to go and meet and make those encounters happen either reach out to them or look for serendipitous encounters but uh you get to meet a lot of fun people and and so you know and build friendships it's not just business it's also friendship so that's one thing and then the the others ideas i think you uh crypto is on an innovation frontier there's a lot of different things happening at any given point in time it's nice to be able to go and see where is the pulse of like the smartest people in the industry where are they spending their time what what technologies are they excited about what blockchains are they building on who's investing in what sectors what what kind of ideas are getting traction i think coming away with that industry-wide pulse is very helpful no matter what you do whether it's looking for jobs or figuring out where to build your product and which you know chain to build it on or which game to partner with uh i think you get a lot of that and i think something like permission this is perfect for that for the people that have not yet had a mobile wallet what's the pitch for them if they need a mobile wallet and they're walking around permissionless doing their crypto things why should they use the coinbase wallet over any other mobile wallet i think if you want a really simple and easy to use wallet that's reliable it's like battle tested and also if you're getting those pro apps and you want them to show up very soon or you're getting like an nft and you actually want them to show up uh i would say go with coinbase wallet and the other thing is if you're if you're on the fence i think you know software wallets tend to get a pretty bad rap right uh like hardware wallets are the gold standard and i do believe they are the gold standard for a good reason but mobile wallets have made a lot of progress and so uh you know we we coinbase wallet for example that can speak for us we use this secure enclave hardware that's built into your phone and that's considered fairly unless someone gets access even if someone yanks your phone unless they have access to your biometrics it's very hard to brute force or get access to those to those wallets and you know sometimes you're at a conference and you you know you have a d5 position that might get wiped if you don't have access to your funds and you don't want to carry your ledger around with you and so there are some good reasons if you're being pragmatic uh you know to consider adopting a software wallet and so yeah if you're in the market for one check out test drive coinbase wallet and and let us know what you think that's funny if you uh if you want to be pragmatic by carrying your coinbase wallet with you so you don't get wiped by your d5 position super pragmatist on one side and then also super risky on the other side but you know to each their own sid thank you for joining us on this episode of the road to permissionless again for the bankless
