[Music] thankless nation it is the third week of july david what time is it it is the friday weekly roll up at the special david in paris edition of the bankless weekly rollover and this is where we go through the weekly news of crypto which there always is a lot of so we go through the market what's happened in the market we go through what got released and then we hit what happened in the news cycle and then we finish up with what uh the ecosystem takes who has some interesting takes in the world of crypto we finish up with what david and ryan are excited about and then we top things off with the meme of the week we might have a moment of zen at the end but at the moment i'm excited about this this this this is the the first weekly roll-up broadcasting from paris so uh pretty awesome man how is paris by the way i am absolutely exhausted but it's yeah it was the it was uh the rob ray for you out yeah ave rave yeah wore me out yeah i got home at like four in the morning last night oh man well thanks for doing the weekly roll up david i know the crypto community appreciates it all your hard work and dedication david before we get in we should talk about the smart contract summit that's coming up i am psyched about this thing because it's basically a free defy conference that anyone can register for whether you're a developer you're not a developer you're just trying to learn about automated market makers layer two um mev oracles all of these subjects will be covered they'll be 200 plus d5 projects and founders and speakers lots of different panels lots of different sessions david you and i will be there this will be a couple of days hopefully right after the deployment of eip 1559 so we are hosting a panel on eip 1559 and the progress just fantastic that this kind of a conference is being put out as a public good it is a smart contract summit you can find a link to it in the show notes make sure you grab a free ticket august 5th through the 7th oracles are really important to blockchains because they allow blockchains to connect to the rest of the world and so any type of application always can have the oracle side of it right so oracles touch everything so every time we everything that ryan and i talk about there's always the oracle conversation right alongside with it which is why chain link is throwing a summit so it makes a ton of sense so see you guys there yeah they're a perfect aggregator for that all right david you ready to get into market stuff let's do it all right bitcoin market tell us what is going on in bitcoin world where'd we start where'd we end hey we so we dumped down below thirty thousand dollars which is a scary number to break through and then we hopped right back above it so we are currently at the price of thirty one thousand seven hundred dollars we started the week a little bit higher but overall i would kind of call it a flat week a flat week like a dip into like the terror zone and then we didn't and then we didn't like that then we got right back out of it yeah below again it's just this this holding crab week crab season i can't even remember how long we've been here it's like one of those things where it's like we've been here for runs years purgatory season yeah um but like under under 30k for bitcoin does not feel happy and under 2k for eth does not feel happy so tell us about eve because we're kind of we went way under 2k not way under but decently under 2k and now where are we yeah we found the a new bottom at around 17 30 in the middle of this week's 1730 started the week off right at about 1920-ish dollars and uh yesterday and this morning uh depending i'm in paris france so depending on you know whatever that means for you uh we actually jumped above two thousand dollars so we jumped almost three hundred dollars which was a big move for ether especially inside of one week so definitely a volatile week and i think this might be on the kind of the hype of elon musk announcing that he owns ether um i kind of also think that like decently the market was ready to gobble up a lot of 1700 e so i kind of think this pump might have been under its own weight and then with the elon musk uh i own ether announcement also just kind of added a little bit of momentum to that too yeah some people say there's like part of the reason we're in crab season is because there's really not a lot of sellers under 30k bitcoin under 2k eth right especially when you get to 1700 eth i'm not sure honestly but you really think that that hop up was due to the elon announcement in that elon conversation the timing was there certainly um but but like i said i think also ether just completely rejected like 1700 each like i think that there are a lot of buyers at that level and one and to say to go on what you were saying the reason why we're in crop market is that there's a lot of buyers at like the 1700 level and like there's also turn they turn into sellers at like a really low level of like 2 200 2 300 that's when the buyers turn to the seller so like there's like a narrow band we got buyers at the floor but like sellers on the ceiling right i don't deal with any of that david i'm just a holder man just a simple lowly holder uh you know what uh you're a buyer too i'm a buyer yeah i've been buying dollar cost average in guys that is the way to do it um i saw this on coinmetrics david i thought this was super interesting this is actually google searches for bitcoin keyword bitcoin google searches for keyword um ether uh ethereum actually and so what's really interesting is uh during this sort of bull cycle 2021 did you know bitcoin in google trends did not actually hit its all-time high search you can see this graph here it hit all-time high search in 2018 the last full cycle which is interesting it's down of course from the all-time high so the all-time high was probably like uh april may or so for not the all-time high but the local high for the bitcoin search in google trends that that just means people are searching bitcoin as a as a keyword like there's buzz about it and it's going in the google search what's interesting about ethereum is all-time high was actually this bull market cycle you see the difference that's yeah it's twice as high as it was in 2017. twice as high which is interesting now it's of course way down because you know people stopped searching i guess nfts snl you know ethereum whatever they were searching but um the fact that it got much higher sort of like the conclusion from coinmetrics is well does that indicate that ethereum has been more driven by retail this cycle whereas bitcoin has been more driven by institutions this cycle of course institutions don't have to google bitcoin there's fewer of them they just have lots of money to pour into it i thought that was a really interesting takeaway and i was actually surprised that ethereum far exceeded its last all-time high in google trends in this in this bull cycle we'll see where this goes next even where we're at right now in in 2021 ethereum google search trends is actually like meaningfully higher than most of ethereum in 2017 and so that that's also interesting the other thought i had is back on the uh the bitcoin chart uh while bitcoin got like the all-time high of uh search trends was was in 2017 look at the area under the curve which i think is like sustained google searching because uh the in 2017 it really looks like a flash in the pan it's like a spike but in 2021 it's like sustained bitcoin searching from for the last like year or so there's a lot of area under the curve for that so that's something to note as well the other thing i i note is like a everything's a fractal look at this early 2017 you had that spike up and then a waste bike down and the summer of 20 2017 no one we weren't searching for ethereum as much right kind of how we are today and then you got a huge spike you know uh october november december january february back again so maybe this is just a a local you know down this would be the theory that hey um after after this summer this is going to repeat similar to 2017 and the bull market shall resume we'll have to see how that plays out um all right let's talk about this david um i i thought this little moon lambo tweet great name by the way great handle little moon well done uh was was very like if it felt right for this week um and he says this a year ago bitcoin was 11k and eth was 320. a year later everyone is panicking because bitcoin is 29k and eth is 1700. the lesson here is don't worry about the short-term price movements when you're in it for the long run when in doubt zoom out good reminder look man uh 29k a bitcoin 1700 eth a year ago if you had told us at this date a year ago these would be the prices a year from now everyone would be excited everyone would be jubilant it would be considered a smashing success but human nature just just has this weird effect when you when you rise for like really fast really high and you're off those highs you feel like you've lost something we have not lost anything we are up on the year in a big way the fact that this tweet got over 5 5000 likes and the meat of this tweet is using the word panicking it says he says a year later everyone is panicking that's just like a buy signal to me it's like yeah people are panicking everyone is liking and retweeting this tweet because they're all resonating with the word panicking uh and so like that's just a buy signal to me and i've been there there's been a number of uh people that uh have come into crypto that are in my my own circles my my non-crypto circles people from college from high school just friends uh and this they're they're they're unicyclers right this is their first cycle i keep on try trying to convince them that the best thing for them that could ever happen to them is ether dipping really really hard like if you are bullish on ether you want the price to go down you want it to go low and this has been one of the most frustrating things with ether at like seventeen hundred dollars or two thousand hundred dollars because i was spoiled when i got into ether i was buying ether between like one and three hundred dollars and so now when i go to gemini and i make my purchases i'm like oh i only get this amount of ether these days with this as far as one thousand dollars gets me one thousand dollars you should give me three ether now it's like one half of an ether like that's frustrating and so like i keep wanting ether to go down more and more and more so i can finish accumulating so this is your first cycle for you be okay with the number going down like that's when you get bullish yes be happy about it it's a buying opportunity um yeah i agree but it's really hard to get people to i mean these conversations didn't happen in 2019 2020 no one was interested in in crypto exactly when they should be um yeah it's such a mind trap that way all right let's uh let's keep moving ether bitcoin ratio what's the ratio telling us this week david last week i was talking about how ether is starting the the btc ratio started dipping below 0.06 and that is starting to get into like the danger red territory but also kind of fitting with that trend of a higher low and that's exactly what happened we painted that floor at like .058 a couple days ago and then with the the jump in the markets yesterday we are now back to .062 which is a great number uh and like i've been saying the east btc ratio above 0.6 is a historical high and it's holding that level really really well in the midst of crab market bear season whatever so the fact that ether is holding that ratio versus bitcoin is is just indicative of i mean a straight up of crab season because it's not going anywhere but it's holding its ground in the midst of a testing time and i think that's really awesome look i do think that this is indicative of a um people aren't letting go of the bull market right this thing could recover when this ratio starts to go like bull markets are to ether's benefit and if we're going to have a bull market and we've talked about this before but eath needs to go up the ratio uh needs to change in ether's direction and it's it's holding steady so it's not losing ground right now which is good to see let's talk about total lock to value in d5 that is also holding steady we're like 55 billion last week i think we're like 58 billion this week just hanging there and ave dominance up about a percent and a half so congrats to ave for continuing to dominate uh let's talk about the dpi this is the death of a week index yeah the best indexes these are d5 tokens but it's down on the week why why down i i i guess the the pump was really focused on the l1 assets ether and bitcoin um some tokens have definitely like recovered since when ether dumped down to 1750 so did a lot of the tokens uh not as a strong recovery in the tokens but i'm gonna call it noise elon does not own defy yet so maybe that's why but i do consider ether defy asset bitcoin too for that matter we'll talk about this later but we need to get elon musk to get into the bed get its fed well you should probably well we'll explain it later that might not make sense to you right now but we'll explain it later okay um this is interesting these were two contrasting headlines that uh we we picked out this week the first is this headline institutional demand for bitcoin evaporates as bitcoin struggles below 31k this is from cointelegraph juxtapose that okay juxtaposed that with this headline from block works fidelity says this is a survey from fidelity 71 of institutional investors plan to buy crypto even amidst a major sell-off the majority of institutional investors surveyed by fidelity expect to hold or invest in the future super interesting institutional demand for bitcoin evaporates this one's saying institutionals are going all in the majority continue to buy and are holding during this period what do you make of this contrast so here's some alpha that came straight out of ecc that it can speak directly to this uh and so i talked to two people that that have privileged information uh one of them is donnie from ave the other one is uh santiago from parify uh and it's tawny while i was interviewing him which is gonna be out on the podcast on monday so definitely tune into that uh i asked him about ave pro which is actually now going to be called ave arc it's the institutional version of ave it's like it's like the coinbase better name i like yeah me too uh and it's like it's like coinbase treasury but for ave uh you know kind of white listed accounts you mean compound treasury yes that's what i meant that's what i meant um uh and so he said i asked him are you building this so that you can then take this to institutions or are you building this because of demand and he goes oh we need we have to build this because everyone all these institutions keep on asking for them and so there's institutional demand for ave arc and that is why they are building it rather than the inverse so that's really important to take away the other thing i was just talking to to um santiago a pit from peripheral capital which is in line atlantic coffee casual conversation and he goes that you know uh institutions and and funds are hitting us up like every single day knocking on our door to ask questions about ether specifically ether and he said uh and we kind of like specifically ether specifically ether right and the train of thought was that like ether just has a lot of surface area for investments like funds they like they like the tech startup vibe of ether they like the the fact that there's products on ethereum rather than just bitcoin which is which is just bitcoin so ether and ethereum has this product focused thing with all these cert this surface area for investments that makes them like ether the asset and so institutions knocking on the door to ask santiago who's a great brain he's one of the d5 panelists that we had so you should also be watching that video uh just saying that there is institutional demand for specifically ether yeah look look i i um i i tend to go where the data goes right like those stories are are definitely uh important and so is fidelity saying send seven out of ten institutional investors hope to gain crypto exposure in the near future i think the juxtaposition of these headlines is what is just short run you know like you got to say something when uh you know price is going down uh and the other is like fidelity's been doing this survey for a while and they've been charting it over time and these numbers are up up up from the last time they did the survey so look the institutions are here uh it sounds like they're getting excited about ether it sounds like they're getting excited about defy uh i don't think they're going anywhere this round this is a real asset class and the thing is it doesn't take a lot of institutions to meaningfully move the market and so that's why you should really still be optimistic there we go we are not we are not bullish today guy or we are not bearish today maybe maybe maybe we never are i don't know we are literally never bearish token terminal this is super cool it's hard to be it's hard to be bearish when you see stuff like this david we are literally seeing a new asset class being birthed um before our eyes caught this tweet from token terminal this is about uniswap's past year okay we talk about the birth of a new capital asset something that has discounted cash flows that wall street can even value uh trading volume for uniswap over the past year 273 billion in trading volume with a b a little tiny protocol 15 people 273 billion dollars unicorn logo unicorn logo like weird like weird vibes simple interface like yeah definitely not wall street definitely not like banker uh you know friendly i guess lp revenue 812 million that's how much liquidity providers made in this protocol unit swap revenue 130 million 16 percent of uh lp revenue the costs for for uniswap just 10 million in grants you can swap earnings then if you do the math there 100 uh 10 million minus 130 million 120 million what is the fully diluted market cap right now about 12 billion so what does that make the price to earnings ratio 102 102 price to earnings ratio if you benchmark that with other exchanges traditional exchanges you've got cme group that has a p e ratio of 40. you've got the ice exchange which is 30. you've got cboe which is 27. you've got nasdaq that's 28. super interesting that uniswap is being priced at a premium but not at an excessive price to earnings premium to these legacy exchanges that are barely growing right and you've got uniswap which is uh just just crushing it in terms of growth so also i would argue like a fair market value based on price to earnings ratio uh maybe undervalued anyway it's super cool because we've been talking about the birth of a new of of defies as capital assets and here it is um it's happening we have the numbers we can do the analysis we can we can we can show the valuation here uh and uh man i'm just like i'm psyched about that and just one small asterisk and i'm pretty sure this is true is that uh the token terminal tweet says uni revenue as 16 of lp revenue is 130 million dollars that's once the fee switch gets turned on so the fee switches five basis points of uh fees goes to the protocol uh and that would represent 16 of lp revenue and so that's where they get that number from yeah it's kind of like um you know facebook pre-revenue before they they put on they turned on all of their you know advertising models and that sort of thing so you see the growth you see the potential they just have to turn the switch and put it on but they haven't done that so it is also somewhat pre-revenue that's a good asterix david all right man we are going to get to releases in just a minute but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your dapps all in one place arbitrarum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing v5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrary arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrome so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord all right guys we are back with the hot releases this week we got to start with this one david it's finally here the bankless bed index jump into bed now you could say it what does that mean it means we're getting into bed we're all getting into bed together you the listener we're all getting into bed bankless bed index it's live wrapped ether wrapped btc and the d5 pulse index 33 each uh and that composes the bed index uh i think that this is going to be one of the best passive tokens that you can buy and uh the the advantage of buying it is a multi-purpose um it's nice because it's all on ethereum so you don't have to own bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain which uh you know don't tell us to a bitcoin but it's really cumbersome to do that just own it on ethereum uh and and now you can get that portfolio of ether the the store value of ether the store value of bitcoin and then the ethereum app layer in dpi extremely passive all in one asset tax advantaged uh very low streaming fees uh and uh bankless bed index brought to you by the bank list dow so nice job bankless dow yeah it's super exciting i mean this is basically the bankless thesis rolled up into one single asset right because it's a bet on crypto monies and it's also a bet on uh d5 so it's a bet on the entire uh banking system that that is being created in in crypto so uh super exciting and what i love about this is um you could protect your friends from buying stupid crappy crypto assets and like fomoing into things and then selling other things too early and the way to protect them is like one click you buy bed and what do you get you get a taste of defy you get some bitcoin which you need you get some ether which you also need and it's all bundled up into one asset right so this is like an etf except it's tokenized and all you have to do is own that so i'm super excited that the tools are available to make a product like this it's also a cool story that the bankless dao actually collaborated with index co-op dow to dao to bring this to market and to launch this thing so save your friends one quick one click like no hassle just get crypto exposure set it and forget it sleep well at night uh get in bed that's all you have to do yeah and i think now that this is out the door and actually on ethereum the next step is to turn this into collateral uh and so uh the the next steps is for the bankless dow to go reach out to ave reach out to compound submit uh collateral requests for these applications to turn bed into collateral you know where i'd also like to see it right on fiat exchanges i'd like to see bed on coinbase i'd like to see cameron tyler get it on and get it on gemini they will they need to see the liquidity he's already close to 650 uh thousand that is a high number right out of the gate not bad all right who else is releasing things sushi swap is releasing things trident i think they released this at east cc so were you there for the announcement do you see this what's kind of what what is this thing what is the buzz yeah i i followed up with joseph de long who was the person that announced this at east uh at ucc uh and so this is actually an a a one of the reasons why sushi swap was always different from uniswap to begin with is that sushi swap is not uniswap it's not just a fork of una swap v2 it is a dao that it can do anything it wants to do so it doesn't have to follow the progression of una swapping it can take its own path and so what sushi has done is they have built out a suite of new products that are completely independent from the original you know a fork of unit swap v2 and so they they have these uh concentrated liquidity pools which is kind of what unisoft v3 is doing but they also have weighted pools which is kind of like what balancer is doing and they got hybrid pools which is kind of what what curve is doing that is specifically good for trading like kind assets they also have this bento box application and so what you what applications can uh do is they can build on top of of sushi swap and they can deposit uh assets into suicide swap and then sushi swab credits those applications with those deposits but then it goes and gets yield and defy with those assets while they are also getting liquidity in in the amm and so it's just a collection of a bunch of the really cool products that we've all been using but now it's all collapsed and condensed into the sushi swap protocol so uh really really bullish for sushi that's a really cool step into a brand new direction uh and it's always just one of the the one of the if you buy and are bullish on sushi token you're really bullish on their ability to build new build and ship new products which they have been proven out to do um joseph de long has been in a twitter a fun like friend twitter is this fun dude is this fun because i i saw this why don't you read the tweet it's pretty fun uh and so dan robinson who is at paradigm and basically built unit swap v3 and joseph de long who is one of the lead devs behind sushi uh they've been having like a twitter war of sorts i don't know how how mean it is i kind of thought it was always like pretty it's frenemies for enemies like you know good good but also hard-hitting jabs uh at each other and so uh joseph de long on may 8th so this has been a while in the makings uh he's tweets out to dan robinson i want you to watch me destroy the house you built on 7 20 21 which was eth cc and that was two days ago uh and so that was uh that was the announcement and so uh joseph you know fiery fiery tweets yeah it's kind of it's kind of funny to see the rivalry between you to swap and sushi swap i like it because it keeps them both on their toes to be honest david i think like even when we had hayden on the the um podcast he basically said yeah we saw what sushi was doing with their token we moved up plans to issue uni token that's been super successful for uniswap so i like this little rivalry as long as it remains friendly we're all trying to build a decentralized financial system of course this was interesting to me i read uh in in the tweets part of this announcement david one existing piece of the road map coming post launch is franchise pools and these are designed to be compliant kyc aml uh require compliant with kyc aml requirements think ave's institutional lending pools somewhat interesting sort of buried in the announcement looks like sushi swap is getting into this institutional defy theme as well that we've seen compound go down the road of and you just mentioned ave too so kind of cool team is team continues to ship um david you know you know what else i thought was cool this week was this graph uh was put together by cad labs the cad labs org team but this is like a graph of eip 1559 and the merge and you can basically model out based on different scenarios like validator adoption or at what date the merge actually happens or how much eath is actually being burnt like the guay price on a given day an average you can actually model um issuance right and see where it gets into deflationary territory i thought this was super cool education material and people can actually like uh there's a github with this model inside of it so i encourage the team to like post this on a website so that people can actually start tinkering with the dials not have to be developers right uh but pretty awesome that this is so close eip1559 and that um it's east issuance policy it's it's it's monetary uh policy is really getting i think cleaned up and solidified with this move and that's super exciting in this screenshot it looks like they have the dial set to a 100 grey gas environment uh and i remember during defy summer when when uh gas would get down to a hundred gwai people would tweet out on twitter yo gas is below 100 great like do you all your things because that gas is so cute now we're in uh crab season and so gas is really low it's been between like 10 and 30. but even at 10 to 30 you're still deflationary and at a hundred if we ever get back to like a hundred for for gray on on the ethereum main chain ethereum isn't just like a little bit deflationary it's really really deflationary look how steep that curve is i mean granted this goes out to 2026 but like i mean i'm going to be around in 2026. and the the target of hitting 100 million ether that looks like we could hit a a supply floor of a 100 million ether before 2030. that's crazy that's crazy somebody i know once said there is no supply floor in this new in this new paradigm it sounds like a really smart guy well i mean you look if you set the model right it's kind of when we had justin drake in the podcast like ether supply doesn't get above 120 billion very likely and could indeed drop um all the way close to 100 million over the next five years or so really cool to model this out and of course it's it's variable it's based on validator um it's based on when the merge actually happens and it's based on block space demand but if you know those variables like you can model out exactly what eth's issuance policy will look like in the future and we've we've not been able to do that up to this point so super cool um let's talk about this so urine continues to ship this looks super interesting david what are we looking at something that assesses the risk of various urine vaults right so you're involved so i have all these various different strategies and there's different assets and there's different applications for every single vault uh and so what they urine has shipped is like a risk risk management or risk disclaimer i guess what's that what's the right way to describe this it's just like transparency right risk exposure yeah risk risk transparency risk risk exposure and so it tells you for every single vault what uh the the exposure to specific defy apps is uh and so as you know different strategies gets built out and deployed to uh to urine it'll tell you like this strategy is like 55 dependent on compound and 32 dependent on sushi swap uh and so it it's a great way to just actually transparently look at the risks that you are taking on when you use yearn and this is something that only you can only do in default you can only do something yeah that you can query the ethereum blockchain and get all of the data you need and so this is like basically a live update system uh because we have all the data at our fingertips and so it's it's like it's like risk in the moment that you need to know it uh so that's pretty cool yeah it's so cool it's like the traditional financial world i don't know if you've ever invested in like a mutual fund but like i i literally still have some uh mutual funds and they'll uh send me paper copies of what's called a prospectus right like once yearly and if you go through like this this book sized uh description of everything that's in there you can maybe glean what the mutual fund is kind of invested in and what the risk exposure is um this does that automatically in real time and there's no accountants no lawyers involved you just query the blockchain uh so crazy so cool that this can be done and it's good to see more transparency about risk i think in d5 because uh we need some of that in order to make investment decisions like where's the yield coming from when you deposit usdc in a year in vault this kind of shows you that and also one of the big problems with risk disclosures in the legacy world on paper is that it's largely the lawyers just like doing everything that they need to do to cya to cover their ass they'll just put in every single like risk disclaimer possible even if it's like not even like relevant like you know acts of god like stuff crazy stuff like that it's it's like lawyer speak and this is not that this is straight up let me tell you the actual parameters of the actual protocol in real time with a visualization paradigm shift yeah it's huge paradigm shift um all right let's talk about this this is kind of a paradigm shift i think grayscale which of course they have the ether e uh grayscale trust that you can buy inside of a brokerage in a if you're in us in a retirement account they also have a bitcoin trust product they have just relaunched launched a defy trust product david so now institutions who maybe for whatever reason can't hold defy assets uh in custody those defy assets or if you're looking for to buy defy in a brokerage account you don't want to go the self-directed ira route which we recommend by the way and custody it yourself you can actually just buy this product inside of your brokerage account now there's fees associated with it but i'm pretty impressed by the index and um and its weightings right we've got uniswap we've got ave we've got compound this is sort of uh it looks like some sort of market sized index of the top maybe 10 or so defy assets so it's cool that this is now becoming available the other interesting thing about this is that this is a partnership between grayscale and coindesk so grayscale made the index and coindesk is is uh grayscale holds the assets and coindesk is doing the portfolio like management and indices that's exactly what index co-op is doing but on defy and that's what bankless dow did with with index co-op right and so bank list or dp or d5 pulse is also doing it like in the index co-op model is like hey we'll actually do the infrastructure and but you guys make the index and then you guys market it right and so yeah that's what d5 posted so they partnered with index co-op to make the dpi and then coin this is the same thing but in in legacy finance which was actually kind of cool but also uh what's cooler is doing it in d5 uh it's way cooler let's be honest it's way cooler like i don't know why you'd buy this product unless you really had to compared to like probably token regulations getting it inside of your retirement account if you're an institution i get it if you are a crypto native man go buy some sets right it's way better totally totally the other thing about this is that uniswap is for 50 of the whole entire index that seems a little bit high uh i just noticed that yeah yeah i mean obviously is that 10 compounds that happen why curves at seven percent maker is at six percent sushi's at four uh four percent synthetic is that four percent i if i was designing this is not market cap weighted then yeah i would have i would have cut down like unit swap's a great asset but like 50 that's a large allocation i would have diversified that out a little bit more yeah that that's interesting guys well do your due diligence on this uh if you choose to use it i'm not sure actually now that you mention it david what the index is based on they have a link for that index methodology right there so you can click that link in the show notes and then click the link in there to go find out we're not going to we're going to move on that's up to you we've got token sets we can do that there um this is cool david ok x is uh an exchange fairly large exchange they now support polygon mainnet deposits and withdrawals david we said this was gonna happen it's happening with polygon a sidechain it's gonna happen with roll-ups layer twos these are additional fiat to roll up fiat to layer two bridges that are starting to come online starting with polygon i love it super exciting to see this happen ok x not an exchange that i've ever used personally i know it has a lot of users but like it's just a harbinger of all the other exchanges that are going to flood into providing this fiat gateway directly to layer 2 super cool so the metaphor that we always use is that defy and ethereum l1 is the manhattan and now with polygon and the other layer twos those are like the suburbs and so you know you fly into new york and and you then you have to take the cars out to the suburbs because you know in the ethereum metaphor there's only manhattan there's nothing else in the world exists but now this is like we have a new airport that's dedicated out for the suburbs so when you fly into the world of crypto and you're coming from your centralized exchanges to get over the hump into the into the crypto world you actually now have the option to not actually land in manhattan and you can go in straight and land in the suburbs uh and so that's the metaphor there you can land in the suburbs you can live there you can shop there you can do all of your commerce there if you want to pay the extra uber ride and get to manhattan you can but you don't have to yep manhattan is now optional yeah exactly all right uh let's talk about this oh my god i can't so um axe body spray do you remember axe body spray um in middle school so if you want to smell like a middle school locker room i guess you can do so with crypto now because axe body spray has just come out with dodge can a8 doge doge can sorry doge can uh doge body spray i guess i'm not i have no idea what that smells like if that smells like uh success or mooning or it says a crypto scent with a dank musk um i had to include this one not super important but i would love to know what a crypto scent is what what do you think crypto smells like i have no clue i'm almost curious enough to buy this yeah a little bit actually okay and so that that's my take here is that this is why i actually think doge has way stronger fundamentals than what people give it credit for because companies like axe or like taco bell gives out free promos for for dogecoin holders or whatever remarketing how much would you pay for free marketing how much would you pay for this i have no clue but a lot of money right and so yeah acts who who you know i don't know who follows the axe twitter account but this tweet got 2 200 retweets and almost 8 000 likes people use doge for engagement and they and they do it consistently and that's the fundamentals behind doge and why doge i actually think it's kind of an underappreciated asset yeah it's uh it's hilarious is this is this cryptoculture david is this what you're talking about when you're talking about cryptoculture i guess so this wasn't really exactly what i had in mind but okay it's i guess it's what i signed up for uh it's something seeping into uh into mainstream all right moving on uh let's talk about immutable they have just a lot launched uh announced the launch of imx a token that is going to power the growth of layer two for nfts on ethereum this is some cool tech behind immutable what they're doing with with layer two and i guess a token to economically power that david what's the scoop here yeah so this is part of the layer two summer narrative the the thing that we all thought was happening and so the imx token the token that powers the immutable layer 2 is getting released it's not released yet it's going to be released in the future so i guess this is an announcement of a future release date or something um but um this is the whole concept is that layer twos are probably gonna have tokens too and those things need to be owned by the community and so they want to get the imx tokens you know distributed maybe they do yield farming uh we'll see the details for the token distribution are in the post uh we had uh robbie ferguson from the immutable team on a on d5 apps on layer 2 panel forever go it was a fantastic panel uh and we also had um representatives from synthetics and and loopering there as well and uh and so congratulations to the team to to get this out the door i'm stoked to have the token out in the wild disclaimer i'm an investor in the token what's cool about this is it's a zk roll up tech right which is different uh specifically for nfts which we haven't seen of course immutable is the company behind god's unchained so you can at least expect gods unchained to adopt this probably many other uh nft nft um games and and marketplaces as well this is also part of nft renaissance this is some of the nft building during the nft bear market and why people are still really bullish on nfts and nft infrastructure this is stuff like that let's talk releases david so the first is visor finance visor finance is just gotten 3.5 million in funding from one confirmation this is an active management protocol so i think the idea here is is generally becoming sort of a more active manager of something like uniswap v3 and do you remember when we had hayden adams on he talked about the advent of these professional market makers on the new uniswap v3 curves it takes a bit more skill to to come up with the right um liquidity setting for uniswap v3 it seems like visor is trying to execute on that totally totally and this is going to this the cool thing about uniswap it has so much surface area for stuff like this you know v3 but also the bad thing about unit swap v3 was that it killed lazy liquidity providers like uh in unison v2 all you had to do is throw in your assets and you could be an lp there was no there was no competition yeah and so it really democratized access to being a market maker it also was really capitally inefficient and so there was trade-offs with the universal v3 we have way more liquidity in union swap v3 but now it's super competitive kind of pushes out the small guy but then protocols built on top of unix swap v3 come back and re-enable lazy liquidity providing for people who just want to collect the fees and don't want to be pressing the buttons all the time so i expect this product to be in pretty well used yeah i'm actually really excited about this and really excited about this segment developing because providing liquidity to unit swap v3 is challenging like it's not for the spain of heart and you have to constantly sort of adjust your position and know exactly what you're doing so it can be tricky and anything that democratizes that is i think a step forward particularly for the passive investor um let's talk about this massive raise absolutely massive open c nft marketplace just secured 100 million in their series b that's around valued at 1.5 billion this is like the first nft marketplace unicorn that i've seen incredible valuation openc's been crushing it so so well deserved also um wow like billion dollar valuations for ethereum applications essentially uh not just not just layer one chains which is what we saw more in 2017 2018 that's a shift too what's your take on this yeah it's and it's a 1.5 billion dollar evaluation without a token you know usually the the the unicorns that come out are come out because tokens just have some sort of premium to them this is a pre-token i don't even know if they have plans for a token i hope they do what do you think they've got to have plans for a token right yeah how do you not have everyone wants tokens tokens are product market fit uh and so maybe maybe this is like the last round that they do before they do a token this is just speculation uh but yeah 1.5 billion dollars congrats guys uh remember we talked about last week that um sbf wanted to buy jpmorgan right at that time valuation was lower but apparently now ftx valuation is 18 billion in their newest funding round i if i recall correctly jp morgan is still 130 billion so sbf has a ways to go but this is an absolutely massive um valuation round and take a look at the investors involved there are a whole bunch of hedge funds paul tudor jones alan howard third point millennium we're all among those participating in this in this funding they are definitely piling into crypto bank investing at this point in time absolutely massive round what's your take also softbank big big uh investor as well which is always interesting to see what they are throwing their money at um it looks like ftx gonna be here to stay yeah so what do you think they're gonna take on jp morgan they're not gonna buy jpmorgan it's not gonna happen guys those are the reasons my stock don't promise that david it's just a sock it could be worse other people have promised worse things in this industry yes i recall david let's talk about the jobs of the week man the jobs board is hopping this week we've got a senior solidity engineer in demand from quant finance we've got a chief investment officer that yield app needs we've got a software engineer that arbatrum is looking for also senior designer from pool together man the talent market is hot guys if you are looking for a job in crypto now is the time to get on that uh demand isn't in shortage you know labor supply can kind of you know set the terms and they want you so take a look at that at the jobs link we'll include that in the show notes lots of great companies lots of great protocols hiring there are 31 jobs available on the job board of all different types of labor and skill sets so go check it out if you want to work in crypto and like ryan said and i've and this is what i've been experiencing at ecc everyone is talking about how finding and retaining talent is difficult which means that you have the ball in your court uh and you have the advantage as the person with talent uh and so get a job go to the bank let's draw board all right let's talk about some news of the week you know we've got to start here with elon musk so we mentioned that in the in the market section so apparently did you see the conversation that elon musk had with uh kathy wood i think jack dorsey was there too right yeah was it a twitter event was that the deal i wasn't there yeah i'm not sure it was the b word conference uh i i missed it but i saw some of the headlines i think one of the major headlines was elon actually came out and said the crypto assets that he owns so uh outside of his company stock tesla and spacex he said he owns just three crypto assets and those are bitcoin no surprise dogecoin no surprise and ether surprise i was surprised by that i was not really surprised like he's tweeted about ethereum before but yeah everyone was looking for confirmation that elon musk does indeed own ether he's never actually stated it before now he did say he has much more bitcoin than ether or doge which is also probably not a surprise um so this this made waves i guess i mean people like to know what elon owns and like to to ape into those investments i think they also talked about a number of other things um bitcoin as a base layer of the monetary system um elon says it can't be by itself a base layer for the world monetary system but it could be on a layer two depending on how it's implemented they talked about some energy production proof of work sort of thing i'm gonna go catch up on that uh that conversation sounds like that was at least interesting any other thoughts here yeah it's always interesting to see what elon has to say i'm kind of worried that like bitcoiners are like hopping right back into like you know elon elon's in our billionaire where we like we like elon again because now he's saying good things instead of bad things and so yes i think we learned our lesson um you know he's just a guy he's just a guy he's just a guy figuring this out like everyone else it is interesting that he owns zero other equity assets other than his own companies though that is kind of interesting i mean it's a pretty pretty interesting portfolio right there this is tesla spacex bitcoin ethe and doge that's what he owns it's the millennial portfolio that's a yeah absolutely um all right let's talk about this ether is ethereum is settling eight trillion in transactions this year that's trillion with the capital t i think we may have mentioned this on the last roll up what's super interesting to me is um jerome powell in a congressional hearing he said that cryptocurrencies have completely failed as a payment system it caught that completely failed as a crypto system yet ethereum is on track to settle 8 trillion in transactions this year it's 2.5 trillion so far but if it just basically continues in the way it's been going 8 trillion transaction we must have a different definition of what failed means because a trillion in settlements on a global peer-to-peer permissionless network that is nothing to scoff at even if you're a central banker like jerome powell what what do you make of this is this just like unaware is this intentionally misleading is this you know ostrich with his head in the sound yeah what is this what why is saying this kind of thing i bet you eight trillion dollars that powell has never made a crypto transaction like it's the only explanation everyone in this industry jokes about going to banks and making money transfers and like all all funds are just like please just send us stable coins if you want to invest in us send us stable coins uh seed investors we use stable coins like everyone just uses stable coins it's way easier to use way better it's the ux is just orders of magnitude improvement this has been a constant theme between you and i ever since we started bank list it's like it's just easier to use crypto what the hell does completely failed even mean like no you're just saying random words powell like get out of here yeah it's like every time i have to write a check i wrote this in the market monday this week i um it's just like why are we writing paper checks it's 2021 right you know and we're still writing paper checks and we're waiting days for ach transfers to settle we're actually signing them with a pen what i don't even own a pen the legacy banking system feels like it completely failed it's failed to innovate for the last 15 years how long have we had the internet david we're still writing with a physical pen on a check paper we have computers now i don't understand i don't understand how people can think that the us has the best banking system in the world this is not even a debate about centralization versus decentralization which we can have that debate it's just a debate about like shitty banking and like good banking and the us has shitty banking right now sorry pal plus we'll revisit this subject when we talk about mastercard later in this weekly roll up but we'll we'll yeah moving on let's let's move to uh happier news this is cool maker dow has come full circle that's the post headline you know more about this you're actually with the team this week what's happening with maker dao yeah so the maker dow foundation is finally dissolving and this has been on the road map for forever and maker has been very much a move slowly and cautiously uh kind of vibe that's that's their that's their deal and so the foundation is finally dissolving the the foundation has spun out into what they are calling core groups and so there are the dao is being a doubt right and so um people are taking the leadership of different so sort of like micro daos and this is how sophisticated maker is and and people really just under appreciate maker and what it's done maker dao is now a dao of micro daos and so there's different core groups which are like the dao like little dolls inside of the overall bigger maker dao and each one is taking on certain responsibilities and roles just like how bankless dao has um guilds uh maker dao has core groups uh and so the maker foundation is is finally dissolved so people no longer are employees for the foundation and they are now taking the reins for the doubt and they have to now go to mkr token holders and ask for permission uh to to have uh funding for their core group uh and so that's that's what's going on and so the whole uh the uh the maker dao is now going full circle is actually because when uh maker dao was started it was started with tokens on ethereum and then they made the foundation because they thought that they needed to start this thing off as a centralized company and then they have finally dissolved the centralized company and they are going back to tokens uh and so they've gone full circle congratulations to maker dao this was the plan all along and so shout out to roon and the lead uh to ruin the leadership at maker they had this vision from like 2015 or 2016 when they started maker dow and they haven't wavered in this in this path uh and so the maker dow story i think is one of the most underappreciated and under-told stories in all of ethereum uh and i'm going to see if i can figure out how to like weave this story together because so many different like stakeholders in the maker ecosystem have only their side of the story of what what has happened over the last four or five years of maker doubt because it's a really awesome one yeah i think it's really awesome and look a lot of people were skeptical that ruined christensen and the leadership would actually leave i mean i i know people called him sort of a like uh maybe a benevolent but a dictator right and like do dictators ever uh you know leave powerful positions and here he is doing what he said he would do the community doing exactly what it said it would do i'm just impressed that maker kind of set out with a mission six years ago has kind of delivered on that mission right like die itself um has uh you know there there are some things that aren't amazing about it right the fact that it's part like largely collateralized by usdc at this point in time i have a take on that if you want it by the way okay like so i want that take but like that aside this is exactly what they said they were going to create with multi-collateral dye and they delivered it and they did it at a time this is one of the the this is one of the first d5 projects i ever use it's when i had a magic moment with with d5 when i realized oh my god i can get a collateral backed lend loan without going to a bank filling up paperwork with a few like clicks and even the janky interface they had at the time it's like mind-blowing to me i know you kind of got your start in crypto too at least down the rabbit hole actually writing about maker this is a very special project uh and it's really cool to see them make this progress and uh and completely decentralize and basically keep their commitment to the community very cool yeah they have not skipped a beat they have not missed a step uh at all uh and yeah like you said before i started writing about ethereum and ether i was actually writing about maker dow and mkr just because that's kind of what captured my attention to begin with uh going back to how 60 of dye is backed by usdc i was talking to a few people from from the team there and they completely understand that it is a trade-off and it's like less than ideal but the trade-off is do you want a stable die and have uh and have it be backed by uscc or do you want an unstable die and have it be backed by like non-non-uh centralized crypto assets and basically it was a trade-off for stability versus you know purity in the in the collateral and as a stable coin you gotta promote stability uh you had to pick one it's a trade-off you can't have everything yeah i totally understand this is the legacy they left to the financial legacy they left um you can kind of see that their quarterly earnings are triple digit percentage growth so they've produced 43 million in earnings up to uh to q1 maybe q2 2021 so i'm pretty impressive financial growth too um just all around great protocol great story and great group of people too they're one of my favorite the maker dow community is like one of my favorite groups of people in this place every time i go to a crypto event as i am right now and make your dowel sewing event i go to the maker dowel event it's like the best group of people shout out that's awesome all right this is kind of cool the documentary ethereum documentary we mentioned last week was completely funded 2 million in funding david i think you have a story about these guys because you've met them actually at etc what's going on yeah i'm in the documentary i mean they they filmed me interviewing vitalik and aya mayaguchi and a few other people at ecc uh and and so they they it's really really cool to see like full production like big heavy cameras boom mics going around the ethereum world uh and so i'm really stoked for a high time yes it's about damn time uh and really excited to see what they put together the name the infinite garden of the movie is absolutely fantastic shout out to mariano conte who's number three of the funders for this movie and mario nakanti was the lead smart contracts at maker dao uh and so like i said amazing community and he he's super excited that he's the number three funder of this whole entire project uh and i'm looking forward to seeing this movie when it comes out uh ryan i i met with the director while here at ecc and she said she wants to talk to us hmm interesting cbd yeah to discuss that all right masterpiece what is this this is in our nft section um is this a new nft platform yeah this uh i don't i don't know if it's new i actually just met the guy here at east's eighth goddamn ecc so hard to say cc uh and he showed me this website and i thought it was really cool and so i just kind of wanted to shout it out it's masterpiece.so and he kind of branded it as like the coin market cap or coin gecko for nfts and so if you want to like figure out what nfts are and like you want to show your friends what nfts are masterpiece.so is a great website to point them towards it's kind of so this is an aggregator of nft platforms basically it's like a catalog of nfts that's awesome very cool um all right let's talk regulation and traditional finance the first is well actually before we do let's talk about bitcoin stuff uh jack dorsey is launching a new square division that will create uh defy it's defy um offerings apparently we're not sure the details of this um but he made it very explicit that this is defy on bitcoin likely bitcoin only uh so it's interesting because it's jack dorsey and also jack dorsey of course not just ceo of twitter but also i think he's still ceo of square a very influential payment processor payment platform in the us of course and he is getting into d5 but doing it on bitcoin what's the take here yeah the the take here is he's just trying to make ethereum uh and so uh that was basically he got blown up on twitter in the comments by all the ethereum people he's like dude you're making ethereum just just admit it uh is he though because ethereum is decentralized right like it feels like he wants to maybe make a crypto bank like a block fi but just call it d5 right or launch a side chain and call it d5 and i already i thought that's this is what sovereign is doing why is the the take here is like why is it so goddamn hard to do defy on bitcoin is why are we doing ethereum in the first place is the answer that question like it's hard to do d5 on bitcoin it actually perhaps is impossible so uh jack just give it up man just give it up it's not happening it's not also i want i want d5 to be on bitcoin but it literally is not capable of being built on bitcoin and that's what we realized and that's what we realized like six years ago and that's why we have ethereum but so why this insistence then is it just i'm jack dorsey i own a lot of bitcoin and okay that's it i mean that's my very unsophisticated take i can't find a different explanation that that makes sense but we'll see what jack comes up with to give him the benefit of doubt maybe maybe he's got something brewing there that we don't know about um to be continued all right back to regulation and tradify mastercard is using circle that's usdc for a settlement pilot so this is payment networks like credit card companies we've already heard visa doing a lot in this space starting to use stable coins good sign for adoption yeah so this is what i was talking about with jerome powell who said that cryptocurrencies have completely failed as a settlement network well mastercard which is literally a payments company is experimenting with usdc for a pilot uh and so watch what people are doing not what you know regulators are saying like see what's actually being going what's actually happening in the real world and in the real world mastercard and usdc are moving closer and closer together let's talk about what's actually in usdc and tether some information interesting information came out about that i don't know if you've ever thought about that like but when you own one usdc you don't actually just own one dollar that's redeemable in a bank um so usdc has had a recent audit 61 of every dollar in usdc is cash and cash equivalents right so that is a dollar in a bank account somewhere 13 is certificates of deposit 12 percent is treasuries nine percent commercial paper five percent corporate bonds and then just a little bit municipal bonds and u.s agencies all in all a very conservative backing for usdc but it's interesting that it's not just straight like dollars in a bank account there are some high like mildly higher yield assets that are bundled in this thing too and that's just being financially prudent now usdc releases these audits um i believe now maybe like regularly i'm not sure if it's monthly and uh jeremy lehrer the ceo talked about actually oraclizing this david so like publishing some of this information on chain so maybe that sort of creates another audit trail for usdc but it's not just a dollar in a bank account it is composed of some other assets that you are trusting now what's interesting is we could talk about this in a second contrast that to tether they have a much more diverse and risky set of assets that are supposedly backing allegedly we don't even know allegedly yeah um but this is what you're buying when you are buying a stable coin like usdc uh i find this kind of interesting yeah so there's two takes that i have here uh one one take is that this is just straight up the circle business model right like very low very pretty low yields on a lot of supply and so 22 billion dollars even just a couple basis points of interest that they get behind the scenes with all of their with all their money it's actually pretty lucrative and also a relatively simple business model uh and uh what was my other take oh yeah my other take you talked about how um how jeremy alaire wants to protocolize the the uh or oracle eyes the actual treasury reporting and audits uh the the rumor i've heard is that he's just trying to really just get ahead of regulations and he knows that like it's coming anyways and so i'm just gonna do it and he's just gonna do it himself and so yeah very smart and also just really a really good look for the industry good looks for the industry but this is a bad look for the industry i think tether um if you've heard jim cramer from mad money cnbc host uh is uh grilling tether and has been you know talking smack about tether for the last few weeks uh and it's because he's basically like we don't know what's inside of tether this is a tether general counselor counselor telling jim crainer kramer on cnbc that an audit is months away so like it's still months away i don't know why this is so difficult unless unless they have some shady feelings and stuff yeah fix some stuff first right like usdc has an audit this goes back to like um we all have choices over what assets we use what stable coins we use i'm not sure why people would would choose tether over usdc in like in like any kind of legitimate case but tether is still larger than usdc do you understand this is this just the binance exchange kind of effect i thought usdc would flip in tether like months ago sometime this year anyway but it hasn't happened yet yeah um the thing is like tether has such a strong lindy effect that i think it's kind of here to stay and there has been like probes into tether that um you know were done by like i think the new york attorney general a while ago and they come up and they didn't find anything which will like kind of ease a lot of people's minds but yeah just overall the lack of options for and taking a peek under the hood is decently concerning and also kind of like a magnet for regulation of this industry and what concerns me is that like regular there could be a world where like regulation begets regulation so like tether gets like you know regulated and then that that just starts the whole process of even more regulation so i'm a little bit worried about that well maybe we'll skip to this this has been a off-cited um white paper actually in in congress congressional hearings this week um called taming wildcat stable coins right and so this is a paper put together from the yale school of management anyway the tldr of this paper from academics is that they want tethers and they want usdcs to actually charter a banking license and to be regulated as banks and of course this would um put a ton of regulatory infrastructure this would essentially make the banks only banks could be the issuers and owners of stable coins and this puts a lot of like regulatory overhead that's probably not needed on top of uh stable coins and um anyway the industry is dealing with this among other regulatory pushes this week and uh it's kind of concerning to me on on that story it's just the recent vitriol against stable coins yeah we'll see what comes out of this this definitely feels like mmt energy and statism which is definitely antithetical to crypto so we'll see where this goes all right um new jersey attorney general issues cease and desist order against multi-billion dollar bitcoin financial service provider this is block fi that they're talking about cease and dis disorder i think the crux of this is new jersey's uh um attorney general is saying that the block fi interest accounts might be securities what not how does that work how are they securities i mean i i don't know i don't know what their argument is um but here's the truth it's definitely less than ideal that this is happening the bureau's action comes with rising concerns this is a quote from the uh the action itself the bureau's action comes amid rising concerns over the proliferation of decentralized financial platforms like block fi so new jersey actually thinks block fi is defy which and jake trevinsky says that's how badly we need to educate our regulators as a d5 bro that's kind of funny uh and also terrifying at the same time uh it's it's just like granted when you come into the space like you just don't know how to use the words correctly uh but again that's why jake is saying we have to educate our regulators what is concerning is that like are they going after block five because they think they are defy because does that mean that defy's in the crosshairs or block fights in the crosshairs who's in the crosshairs here i can't really tell um but i don't know either i don't do you think they know do you think regulators are just i have no clue this this story definitely needs to get like unpacked and like evolved uh where is it gonna have to be a wait and see type thing zac prince ceo of blockfi thinks they're going to be fine uh they remain optimistic through this but what we'll see is that story he would he would think that though you'd have to say that if you're zac prince definitely um let's talk about this binance is ditching stock tokens finance yeah these are like synthetic stock tokens that they recently i think announced that they were going to um start trading on on binance and this is like the ability to buy a synthetic apple on binance who do you have to trust you have to trust sort of finance in order to do that uh they are ditching that entire plan in order to i think uh quell some of the regulator concerns recently yeah this is that the third week in a row where the binance squeeze has been a theme uh binance they just got squeezed out of one of their products by regulators uh and so the binance squeeze titans david we're going to talk a bit more about regulatory takes when we get to the subject but first we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make

infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right guys we are back with the takes of the week let's start with this one from jason choi does this feel like 2018 to you he says some of you weren't around in the 2018 crypto bear market here's what it felt like to him he said everyone was bitter on twitter d5 wasn't even a thing nft just a few guys bag holding crypto kitties just a few discords active that's it many investors in the space completely abandoned tokens they pivoted to equity small crypto funds shut down left and right people went back to tech in traditional finance media attention completely dried up crypto twitter traders who larp as vcs and builders today were just mostly ship posting had nothing else to do besides that even people within crypto stop producing content fundraising was tough investors wouldn't pay a dime for today's tier 1 projects on the good side you had some time to build but on the bad side that's all what 2018 felt like i think he's painting this picture david to kind of contrast some people are saying we're in a in a bear market now and he is painting this picture i think to contrast what a real bear market feels like versus where we are now i'm curious you were there in 2018 like does this um does this land with you is this what a bear market feels like how did you feel in 2018 versus how you're feeling like now yeah how did i feel in 2018 i was so in 2018 i was still like in my learning process about crypto i was still like coming to terms with what crypto is and so that was still exciting for me and that's the difference between people that like you know only come for the bull markets versus the people that were born in the bear markets uh but yeah like like a lot of what we know of today was built and like established in 2018 2019 by the people that stuck around and it does this era right now and crypto does not feel like that at all there's still a ton of attention there's still a ton of energy news cycle events just like you know tweets going into the mainstream elon musk tweeting about crypto still like no this does not feel like 2018 at all granted like you know we're still on the the you know the recent super highs of 60 000 bitcoin and 4 000 uh east is still like really relatively recent and so like in theory if we kept on going down and longer that's what this would turn into uh so it's maybe it's not the right comparisons but yeah the the 2018 bear market was absolutely brutal in terms of a price action but also i think really really rich in terms of the people there uh and in his number five tweet he talked about like only a few people were producing content uh and uh or number four was it uh but like the people that remained in in the world of crypto in during the bear markets was like the people that you definitely want to uh to hang out with right because those are the other people who are definitely in it to win it over the long term uh and and i actually still feel like i see that now i feel that like that energy now i think the difference right now is that people are coming into crypto even with these like slightly down prices that we've seen right and so i think the amount of like uh the the snowball of crypto is rolling and rolling and it's already it's already hit escape velocity and more and more people are going to come into this industry regardless of prices just because there's so much more things to do here and that is a very like very different from what we saw in 2018 totally agree totally different feeling right now even though we're off all-time highs by a decent amount than 2018 2018 just the the level of um like sadness like everyone krypto was dead at the time ethereum was dead defy would never work it was never coming back it was just this niche thing that blew up with with icos no one was talking about it at all completely different feeling than where we are now so um yeah echo that sentiment the last thing i'll say is that in 2018 we felt like there was it felt like we were in like a schrodinger's position of like everyone was really really like excited and bullish and optimistic about the future because we saw that there was these really cool things happening in ethereum and defy yet the prices were just completely separated from that yeah and when when prices separate from what you see is fundamentals like you wake up you wake up every day and you're just like am i wrong right you're like and then you dig in and you're like oh i can't be wrong right like this is the future i'm absolutely not wrong you start using this stuff and then but it's a it's a it's a constant um assault i guess because you don't you don't have assurances about if you're right or not until the markets actually turn around right so like exactly am i crazy am i for thinking that this uniswap thing is absolutely groundbreaking it's like am i crazy for this why do i why do i think this is so cool and why does no one else think this is cool why does no one else think this is a big deal why is no one paying attention to this and look if the markets um say you're wrong for long enough on a long time horizon you're wrong right right like if that goes on for i don't know i don't know what the time all of your life all of your life all of your life you were definitely wrong and it is important as an investor to like peel away from wrong decisions and not delude yourself into um something that the market is clearly into that's why that's why it was so difficult completely different feeling now market the market's still validating this but so is mainstream and we don't have the level of depression and sadness we had in um maybe it's because of this david why don't you read this next week yeah this tweet uh from kyo wang crypto is the first genuinely new asset class since the 17th century let that sink in and that's that's kind of like what i always felt like in in 2018 is like it doesn't matter like i'll always like have my insecurities about whether like this is actually just going to be a niche thing and crypto isn't going to take over and i'm spending all this time in this industry but but wait a second crypto is a new asset class and it's the first new asset class in like 400 years like whatever that is sounds exciting uh and so i'm here for it i'm here for it too um but these could be some headwinds in in the short run this is from jake trevinsky who we quoted before when he was talking about um the new jersey yeah blockfy uh issue but he says i don't have much hopium for you it is how it looks pretty grim that's how he starts this tweet and uh for background we've had jake trevinsky on the show he is uh formerly legal counsel at uh compound actually he might still be legal accountable he's at a variant fund now oh variant fund now okay and um but he's very plugged into the regulatory landscape talks to to regulators legislators often very just plugged into that world and for him to say he doesn't have much hope is is kind of uh concerning to me now jake has always been one to to like basically raise the flag on we need to educate regulators and we need to educate the world about this so i think part of this is a message for crypto look um we should be worried because our regulators and our government institutions don't actually understand crypto so i think this is part partially him raising the flag and saying we need to work harder to educate um you know those those in power those in charge but also i think it's him reacting to some of the news about stable coins this week a new jersey block fi like the binance squeeze all of these things kind of compounding together to maybe put a advice on the crypto industry and like marginalize it i think that's what i don't think look governments can't kill this thing but they can attempt to marginalize it and squelch it in the short run what's your take here it is concerning because jake has like a vantage point that no one else has it's one of the best vantage points in the industry um but also crypto has a the nature of crypto is to route around problems uh and so uh i believe in our ability to overcome through innovation any problem that that we see ahead of us it's just a matter of just like is this going to be easily solved without any problems or is this going to take us a little bit longer and we'll have to problem solve for a few more years first it's that's kind of the my take there people have asked him to expand his thoughts and he says he's writing so maybe after he publishes something we'll definitely we'll definitely uh push that out in the bankless newsletter and maybe have him on the podcast to uh to talk further about what's going on the regulatory but that could definitely be some some short run uh headwinds if some regulatory action comes down the spike in better news though preston van loon says there are 100 000 blocks left until london activates on ethereum mainnet this is the next ethereum hard fork this is the one that contains eip 1559 a hundred thousand blocks left david i'm not sure that i can translate that into time though like what is a hundred thousand blocks oh a hundred thousand blocks is a hundred thousand blocks i don't know it doesn't matter about the time it's a hundred thousand blocks away and this is actually two days ago is that how you keep time though uh i'm working on it yeah now that i'm in paris time and then you're in you're in est i'm in in pst we should just start using block time block time okay yeah so uh we're gonna do the next um next 50 000 there you go and speaking of the hard fork david eip1559 tim baker does some calculations about making eth a deflationary asset uh why don't you talk about this yeah so there's been some controversy about whether ether it will be deflationary after eip1559 uh and it is there's a take here where like straight up the fact that we are burning each gives it a deflationary element and then ether becomes actually deflationary when gas burning or ether burning actually supersedes ether issuance and ether issuance at the moment of eip1559 will still have proof of work so there will still be ether issuance which means for ether to become actually deflationary as in the actual supply of ether is going down in number after eip1559 that gas number is 150. and so every day that you see gas at a 150 or higher ether is deflationary we are burning more than we are issuing once we go to proof of stake and once ether becomes ultrasound money because we don't have to issue very much ether at all under a proof of stake paradigm that gas number goes down to 11 11 and like either has ethereum has almost never been below 11 uh gray ever since like probably the start of 2020 uh and so uh ether is definitely going to become deflationary like i i can't imagine a world where we don't have like there's less than 11gway on the main chain uh and so in proof of stake q1ish 2022 ether becomes definitely deflationary i'm more surprised about this first number actually i hadn't like run the math in this way but so this first number says that even before the merge while we still have like 4.2 percent issuance on the proof of work chain if we have gray prices of 150 or above we are actually turning eth into a deflationary asset on the days that that we maintain that average that's pretty crazy to me i didn't realize that yeah and like there has been times where ethereum has stayed above 150 gray for it for months and so these are not crazy numbers all right let's go to this take this is take from vitalik uh this is from eat cc i don't know if there's much buzz about this take but uh once you read it out david this is just one of the slides that he had while he was presenting his talk yesterday and this i thought the slide itself was interesting and this was about what his talk was about was non-financial applications of ethereum ethereum is a world computer it's actually the the vision for ethereum is not just decentralized finance and money and assets it's actually a complete reconstruction of the internet itself uh and so yeah that's a whole like rabbit hole that we actually haven't really gone down much of bank list maybe we should do that but the take on the on the slide is the vision for ethereum and much of crypto beyond ethereum has always been to take decentralization trust minimization and mechanism design experimentation far beyond finance uh and so one of the examples that vitalik talked about was like logging in with your ethereum address we've talked about that on the bankless podcast plenty of times all you have to do is like no more email passwords just sign a sign a message with your ledger and then you can log into a website establish your identity there identity is another ethereum use case the whole money and finance things that just comes first because that's like the fun part that's the part where everyone gets rich but there's plenty of other technological innovations brought on by the powers of cryptography and ethereum that have nothing to do with money and finance and so vitalik is turning his attention there and that was kind of the purpose of his uh of his talk at east dc was to call attention to this side of ethereum that he thinks is uh uh un getting an undeserved uh too little attention these days yeah i think it's interesting like so um vitalik is maybe uh talks like five years ahead of where things are right so he first actually used the term um legos like money legos in 2014 right before anyone could sort of conceive of it so he actually said uh ether the money lego uh i still have my claim on the money legos meme i don't know i know that i know that's important to you yeah i know i want to differentiate that but like yeah and um so he was like talking about that in 2014 when no one saw that and um i think now he's talking about stuff that that is kind of like no one sees and is like five years in the future i still do very much feel though um this is kind of a take that i think people like haas you have and arthur from defiance capital it's still like digital scarcity the creation of digital scarcity like money is going to be one of if not the primary use case for this thing that we've created right like i agree i um so like i i think that ethereum will do other things in decentralization and identity um but like even even if you look at ens names right that enos names well some might not call that finance they are an asset aren't they right like you buy it and trade it they're an nft so i don't know i'm not saying i'm i'm totally i'm like skeptical of this take i just think it might be farther in the future than than people think and still there's like so much left to do with creating a decentralized money system we're still like in the 1800s of that like we still have collateral backed loans no and we're still just getting the lending building money legos uh tm david hoffman um built out so like yeah it's but it is cool uh you know i guess that's all i'll say about that yeah i think we can definitely take the trend that we've seen in ethereum is that if you build out this cool thing on ethereum it's all cooler if you can add an asset to it and then the community likes it a little bit more yeah if it can have an asset it probably will it probably will and maybe should um let's talk about this oh what's this david you got a selfie in here yeah this is a selfie so uh at the this is the first ever maker dao event that is not led by the foundation so this was the dao throwing a dao event for maker dao and while they were presenting that while they were presenting i totally hijacked their stage when i ran up on stage and took a selfie with the dao because like i said maker dao is so underappreciated and i'm actually really excited to see what the dow can do now that it's out of uh out of the umbrella of the foundation the foundation was really restrictive on like what a lot of the dow members wanted to do largely around marketing and promotion and so now now they have broke they broke free of the foundation they they took off the chains took off the shackles now they can actually be mkr and maker shills which there have never been in ever and that's why people consider maker to be like boomer finance is because the foundation prevented them from shilling mkr as like a regulations protect protection like uh strategy which probably probably a good strategy um and so uh now so they can be less conservative they don't have the less conservative they can all be maker shills they can all be major shows and uh maker dow definitely could could use some some shilling and so this is what i'm doing right now schilling make a doubt don't underestimate make it out you're part of it all right man what are you excited about this week yeah i'm excited for the podcast that is coming out on monday and i recorded it while i was here at ecc and so that will be uh in your ears on monday morning so definitely tune in to that the podcast is the ecc experience if you did not get to experience ecc yourself you stayed home you couldn't have made it you didn't get a ticket and you was me yeah but and you want to it feel like what it was like to be at east cc you should listen to the podcast so i interviewed a bunch of different names uh from the ecc event stani kane vitalik imi gucci uh a number of others uh and so like 15 minute clips about what ecc is like for them and there and then also a little bit about each project right so some really big names uh and it was a ton of fun recording at ecc i had a little studio to myself so it's gonna be one of the most um uh off the it's gonna be a brand new podcast format format because uh ryan wasn't there ryan wasn't at cc and uh ryan actually interviewed me uh at the intro for what it was like for me to be at ecc so uh that'll be in your pod in your podcast rss feed monday morning so check that out uh and then the other thing i'm excited about ryan is that uh bankless the bankless podcast has never missed an episode since genesis every single every single monday for uh like over a year and a half now and then we started doing the state of the nations and we have never missed a state of the nation every single tuesday and then we started doing the bankless weekly rollups and we have never missed a bankless weekly rollup in your inbox every single friday and so what i'm excited about is dude consistency okay we're i'm this is a bankless shield moment right now like we don't miss and so people were thought it was weird that i literally checked my imac computer on the plane so i could take it to paris like dude this is your first time in paris and you brought your imac computer what the hell no you gotta deliver the bankless bad ass david david hoffman absolutely look if you are a content producer consistency is key right it's like a trust relationship that you set up with everyone who tunes into your material and you have to keep it consistent um yeah wow good i didn't realize it's been that long and we've been so consistent but we really have yep edible and like i definitely feel the energy and the appreciation from the community here at ucc like it's it's hard to walk like a hundred feet without somebody saying like hey man i love the bankless podcast and my default response is like hey man me too dude that that's awesome um we should meet in real life sometimes celebrate one right so that's the uh the third thing that i'm excited about i got three this week is that uh if if uh we can convince the infinite garden people if they're actually going to include us in the documentary which i hope they do uh i think it'll be really cool if the the part that they actually what they actually like interviewed us is like when we meet for the first time yeah a fun little a fun little like uh bit yes where should we do it yeah we'd have to meet in the middle we have to feed me somewhere nice territory colorado i don't know about the middle yeah colorado would be nice i'll do colorado yeah in colorado let's see that let's see all right um yeah i'm excited about the bed index it's finally here so this is exciting on multiple levels right so it's exciting because it's kind of the bankless thesis and it's really played out right this thesis of there's gonna be crypto money should invest in that bitcoin ether and d5 and you should invest in that we've had this thesis since like 2019 and we've been preaching it now there's a product that embodies it that's the first level second level is this is a way to onboard your friends right when we started bank list the mission was really simple we want to onboard a billion people into d5 into going bankless and the first step to going bankless is actually holding some bankless assets some assets that aren't backed by a central bank some assets that you have complete custody over and control over and now defy has evolved to the point where you can do that in one click right so a really easy product that you could just like talk to your friends about get into crypto if you want exposure you just like purchase it and buy it that's really cool the third thing that's cool is um the dow light created this so do you remember uh you and i like thought this would be a good idea we talked to the index co-op folks about it um and we post on their governance form this evolved into the bankless dow kind of taking it over bringing it across the finish line and now you've got index co-op and the bank list out and they are bringing a product to market awesome awesome awesome those three things plus this the memes that are going to come out of the bed get into bed like um you hop into bed ditch your other assets and like go sleep in bed i don't even know what the mean potential of bed index is going to be but i know it's going to be hot and i'm excited to see that fulfilled in crypto twitter and other social media i'm excited for the memes david very excited for the memes that's why i'm excited about this week i hope i hope cryptowife who has produced some very very good bankless memes i hope she makes a bankless bed meme so uh maybe maybe we can reward her with some bank tokens if she does that uh there you go kevin kevin walkey's talk at east cc was about how uh the chord it was about coordination because he's all about coordination but he talked about a mesh network of dows all coordinating with each other like and making that rising tide and when i see bankless bank listow and index co-op producing a product together no centralized companies needed like that's we don't need any of that well all we just need is discord and ethereum and all of a sudden we can make products uh and so i'm really bullish on dow to dial collaboration and uh having a brand new bed bed product uh is fantastic yeah so my man it's awesome all right david you ready to get into the meme of the week meme of the week let's do it all right man this this one kind of hit me uh what are we looking at here yeah so we're looking at a picture of payment with a big crack in it and then the crack has a band-aid over it uh and the text is uh and this is labeling the crack the soul-crushing reality of being a young person in this late-stage capitalistic hellscape and then the band-aid's got a label and the band-aid label is a dow with the homies indicating that like the band-aid's gonna like help you help you cope with that but that's what that's what dolls do dows are just like you know you and your homies like doing dow stuff and allows you to like you know uh come into a new world that is separate from our old world which i think causes a lot of existential angst to young people uh and so that's the meme of the week that i think this meme of the week is is really good because like i don't think anyone's saying that dao's in the here and now in their current form none of us are saying they're gonna solve all of the wealth inequality problems all of like the political instability all of the late stage capitalist type problems that the us is facing the world is facing no one's saying that but like they do give a little bit of hope don't they and when you're partaking in a community like a self-sovereign community so people forget this isn't just a movement about self-sovereign individuals it is that absolutely is that it's also about self-sovereign communities and when you're part of a dao and you're sort of you know creating something collaborating uh together on a project that does give you some hope right this is a new coordination mechanism that is kind of outside of our existing um i guess late stage capitalist world and something i think a lot of younger generations are going to resonate with and maybe they kind of need david right like millennials zoomers when they look around about the future and like what's going on where do they find hope right i mean i feel like crypto is the most hopeful thing uh like that is happening it's the most hopeful social revolution it's about building something brand new that is um like doesn't have the problems that our existing system has not tearing it down but building something new from the ground up so man i didn't expect to get this deep on a meme dude but like that's why this hit me it's a good well sign of a good meme and uh shout out to kevin owaki again i was watching his talk at ecc like i just said and he had this line that also hit me ethereum is a shelling point for the hopeful so if you are hopeful you find ethereum all right we are going to lead out with the moment of zen david you're gonna have to explain this for the podcast listeners what's happening yeah so this one came out of aston kutcher's twitter account and so uh this is actually gonna be easier if you are watching it on the youtube but it works on the podcast as well so you're gonna hear three voices uh ashton kutcher asking his uh i think wife mila kunis a bunch of questions because mila kunis is actually getting into the world of nfts she has her own nft platform and so he's asking her some he's just making a joke asking her some random questions about crypto and then the last question gets answered by somebody different and i think you'll recognize that that person's voice hey babe yeah what's uh crypto it's digital currency hey hey babe yeah what's blockchain it's like what information stored on so like it's you know what information is stored on hey babe yeah what what's uh decentralization oh there's not one person in charge of anything so it's everybody keeps everybody else in check so there's not one big like unit or entity to uphold everybody to the same code it's the people holding each other responsible hey babe yeah what's ethereum so ethereum is a general purpose blockchain so unlike um other blockchains like a bitcoin for example that are just designed around one application so the way that bitcoin is designed around digital money um ethereum is an open platform that allows people to build their own applications on top and anything built on top of ethereum gets protected secured everything is checked by this uh entire network of like thousands of computers around around the world that are protecting and checking um every transaction on the blockchain but because it supports a programming language developers have this unlimited creativity in what kinds of things that that they actually create on ethereum so you can use ethereum to make a cryptocurrencies or nfts or many other kinds of things yeah that makes sense hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto investing skills and learn how to free yourself from
