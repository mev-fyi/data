i think crypto will be the 12th sector of the economy within 10 years because it adds so much liquidity so much productivity so much transparency so much auditability it's so much better than what we're doing right now which is so expensive and so slow welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get better how to get started and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bagless guys this is an incredible episode we've got to maybe i should say it's a wonderful episode david we've got kevin o'leary mr wonderful himself or should we say mr wonder phi he is the second shark from the shark tank uh tv series that we've had on other than mark cuban and actually we caught him at a time where he is live on on the ground in capitol hill in washington dc he's fighting for crypto in congress meeting with some legislators over this new crypto legislation that is being proposed by senator lumus so first on the list we asked him what is happening in washington what's up what's his perspective on that but look for some other takeaways as well number one we talk about the bear to bull kevin's crypto conversion story how that transformation occurred number two why crypto natives should actually want good regulation number three what he's invested in what does kevin o'leary's crypto portfolio look like what is how much of his net worth is in crypto we talked about that and number four what he thinks will happen next in crypto 2023 and beyond into the future how this industry will transform david really fun conversation with uh mr wonderfuy what were some of your thoughts i was just really impressed by how sharp kevin was man you guys he's 67 years old and that guy is sharp as attack and you know that he just loves the game the game of investing the game of growing capital and one of the questions we asked him is as he turned from a crypto skeptic deeply skeptical of crypto in 2017 to deeply bullish crypto in 2021 how has his allocation towards crypto gone from zero to what it is now uh and hearing that story of him just becoming more and more convicted about what crypto has for the world which is really refreshing to see from somebody who's 67 years old yeah again like knows markets inside and out and so mr wonderful has turned into a fantastic evangelist reaching corners of the capital world that bank this just doesn't reach yet tbd um but like he's just doing a such a great job evangelizing for for our interest both on capitol hill with hedge funds and just again corners of the of the money world that otherwise wouldn't have heard the good word of crypto yeah guys i think you're really going to enjoy this episode with with kevin like i'm he's using these d5 protocols he knows his way around the space invests in over 32 projects some of which we are also very excited about so he's got a good take on the industry as well as um he's got a good take on what needs to happen next and how we're going to grow into a 10 trillion dollar industry so stay tuned for all of that we are going to get right to the

nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest this is kevin o'leary aka also known as mr wonderful that's probably what many of you know him as uh although i'm kind of thinking david we should start calling him mr wonder five because he's doing so much in the in the d5 space but you might know him from the startup competition on tv called shark tank he is a serial entrepreneur he's an investor macro bond markets seed investing and now more recently on the frontier of crypto kevin welcome to the show how you doing man very good thank you very much hey so you are uh in washington right now that's why you're all suited up and looking spiffy what's uh the conversation in in washington what are you there to do well as you know the alumnus bill has dropped a couple of hours ago it's been long awaited this is a bipartisan effort very important set some parameters around whether you know chains or commodities or securities contemplates all kinds of different attributes such as stable coins and it's important to get this off the ground this dialogue has been sorely needed but it's not the only bill there's also the haggerty bill the toomey bill other initiatives going on so you've got a lot of of policy makers finally addressing this issue but for the first time basically knowing that there's a huge institutional demand waiting to get involved when they finally bring policy forward and and i'm just here to be part of it there's many private citizens involved it's important to get to washington important to talk to these leaders important to give your ideas they're basically soliciting the industry and i think that's important well kevin thank you for for being there and representing all of our interests and the interests of the crypto industry as a whole i just want to pick your brain a little bit more about uh how you are trying to move the needle yourself off yeah off we see uh cynthia alumni and the bill cynthia lummus and the bill is exactly the kind of legislation that we need to promote the merits of this crypto industry i i'm wondering like uh what do you think that you can help do when you are in washington and how are you helping move the needle there so you know what what i'm suggesting and i'm just one voice but but i try and say this over and over again to policymakers is let's pick one thing i mean the crypto universe is so broad it's so huge there's so many different things going on at the same time let's bring policy on one thing and get that done and what i'd like that to be is stable coins because as a payment system right now it would be very very productive to bring forward some policy on stable coins and let the market compete now i personally prefer ones that are backed by hard assets like the us dollar but there's many ideas out there some work some don't obviously what happened with luna was a bad outcome but that's okay this is a neason industry and we're trying different ideas but the the the need for an international payment system is so huge and so it's such a huge opportunity to save costs to provide transparency auditability liquidity speed all of those things that's what i'm suggesting let's pick one thing and bring policy on stable coins let's nail that and then we'll move into bitcoin we'll move into blockchain we'll move into other things but nfts but let's nail one thing that would feel good for uh congress to kind of nail thing nail one thing it's been largely silent on crypto like we've had no clarity in this space and i'm curious since you're there in washington you're kind of plugged into to some of these circles a lot of people in the in the crypto industry the crypto natives of the world are are somewhat skeptical of washington like you mentioned washington or you mentioned congress and they just kind of recoil like we don't need government sort of thing uh we're more on the side of you know we want governments to bring forward uh sensible regulations so that not not that um you know so that america won't miss out on crypto and they won't miss out on d5 and all of the innovation not for the sake of d5 but for the sake of the united states let me ask the question as you're in washington you're looking at the senator uh lummus legislation some other legislation are you optimistic that they're gonna get it right like do they actually understand crypto this time what do you what do you make of this bill and similar efforts they don't need to get it right they just need to get it in other words we got to move forward on something here and i'll tell you why for all of the people in the crypto universe and there are many that don't think we need regulation let me point something out that would get everybody on board it's a very simple quantum mathematics and here's how it works the majority of invested capital on earth is held by sovereign and pension plans about 90 plus percent of it they own zero crypto nothing and so for all the excitement about bitcoin 800 billion that is absolutely a giant nothing burger it is totally irrelevant it's not held by any institutions that matter now i'm an indexer and i've talked about this many many times in there's many indexers in the world but we we service sovereign funds pension plans let's say you're an oil rich country in the middle east you're making 250 million cash a day us dollars in oil revenues you don't want to reinvest in oil you want to invest in every other sector so they'll go to an indexer like me and say index the s p 500 less energy less airlines that's the kind of index we do and i so we see these fund flows trillions of dollars of fund flows every year just going through the system indexers see that every 24 hours and i always ask these institutions and these sovereign funds what allocation would you put into bitcoin just one bitcoin which is the granddaddy digital asset everybody knows that what would you allocate if you could and they said well we can't because our compliance department won't allow it because the sec hasn't ruled on it yet and larry fink doesn't like it and he's our biggest money manager and all those other reasons but they would allocate 50 to 100 basis points now when you're running a trillion dollar mandate or 800 billion dollar mandate which is some of the size of these funds that's a ton of money and that's a huge amount of demand that would come into the market and as bitcoin prices went past that one percent allocation let's say they'd sell it back down to one percent but just importantly if it dropped below one percent they'd buy it back up so there'd be an internal bid forever the volatility would drop dramatically there'd be price appreciation in bitcoin it would be good for everybody involved in crypto but we can't do it without policy and so everybody should just get off this let's be rogue let's be crypto cowboys forget all that crap it's time to get this real and get a tremendous amount of capital going into crypto because it's policy and it gets regulated and it's good for everybody kevin you talked to so many people across the whole world the whole landscape of investors and and regulators and i've actually i've been keeping an eye on on your trajectory in the crypto space going from the 2017 skeptic to the 2021 bull uh and i'm wondering as you are now talking to so many people and as the world becomes peaked by crypto and interested in crypto what's your generalized pitch for for why crypto is here to stay why crypto's good whether you're giving it to a legislator on capitol hill or a hedge fund manager with a billion dollars in their portfolio why crypto why is crypto good and what do you have as like a generalized pitch for people because the largest economy on earth is financial services i think crypto will be the 12th sector of the economy within 10 years because it adds so much liquidity so much productivity so much transparency so much auditability it's so much better than what we're doing right now which is so expensive and so slow if i want to transfer capital over to zurich to buy nestle stock and swiss francs it takes me days and it costs me a fortune and it's incredibly inefficient i could do it in two seconds with a stable coin and i can't yet because we don't have policy on both sides of the ocean that let me do that but it's coming one day and i think crypto and blockchain and the services and financial transactions microtransactions all of it are going to lend itself to this blockchain auditability transparency the ledger system it all makes sense to me and i think regulators are starting to figure that out now as an investor i don't know which of these chains is going to win is solana going to be polygon should i be in poland what about you know all of the others ethereum of course the big one right now but too slow for many many financial services what's going on with you know helium and all of these different ideas out there so my strategy is to do the same thing i do with stocks get diversification i own 32 positions 32 chain projects 32 different coins and tokens i have no idea which ones will win over the next five years but i don't need them all to win i just need a few to win and that's what diversification is all about and i've made some investments in the infrastructure you know that old adage and the gold rush you were better owning and selling picks and shovels and jeans than you were trying to find gold because that was very hard to do the infrastructure of crypto are companies like ftx i'm a shareholder circle i'm a shareholder i wonder if i i'm a shareholder immunible holdings i'm a shareholder i've given money to all of these projects because they make a lot of sense to me and i use them all and they're centralized decentralized there's stable coins in there there's the ftx platform which is the first compliant institutional platform i can find that my auditors and my compliance department finally agree to let me use to store value and this is those are the kind of things that really matter to me and i have to disclose yes i'm a shareholder in fdx i'm also a paid spokesperson so i've you know i'm eating my own cooking but i'm also talking about the merits of their compliance platform yeah kevin so i'm i'm interested in that that that comment you just made i like them and i use them all all right so here's the position of of so many in washington so many of our our lawmakers so many that are kind of outside the crypto space is probably similar to your position in 2017 your your pre-conversion uh position on crypto which is like i like i don't understand this like what i i don't even like it seems like a bubble it's i don't know what your your takes were back in 2017 but i know you were bearish you were negative can you talk as somebody who has been converted who has started to use these products in your everyday life can you speak to that skeptic what what do you tell the skeptics in dc or in the finance space or you know the the thinks of the world what do you what do you tell them about crypto how do you how do you explain it how do you convince them so i'm an investor i'm constantly trying to find a way the path of least resistance to invest my capital redeploy it i have to look around the world for opportunities i have to be diverse and you know crypto to me when it was being frowned upon by regulators in a very harsh way if you recall 2017 was probably the height of when regulators were cramping their clamping down on tokens and different ways to to to tokenize assets like hotels and everything else back then and as a result i'm so involved in the traditional financial services market where i'm highly regulated and i have to report almost monthly to both my internal auditors compliance department and external regulators all around the world that that's the world i'm used to and i saw no relief coming from regulators and then what turned me around what changed me completely was when the canadians the osc granted the very first crypto exchange license attached to a dealer broker a compliant platform it wasn't rogue anymore they told canadian citizens you can transfer your cash out of your bank into this centralized wallet and you can trade ethereum bitcoin and slowly more and more coins were added then they announced in canada the very first bitcoin etf then they announced the very first etf that was for ethereum they were moving forward with policy that was regulated and i immediately started investing in that because i saw it coming i saw the writing on the wall and i've also made the assumption this is a personal assumption that the osc the regulator that granted that world order for the first time a dealer broker was well in touch with the scc and other regulators around the world they talked to each other every day maybe canada was being used as a petri dish or an experiment to try it and it's been wildly successful that's when i got involved in wonderful i became a shareholder there wonder if i bought bit by which was the first regulated exchange and now that company has 800 000 registered compliant crypto accounts it's the model for the rest of the world so i got on a plane i went to united arab emirates switzerland england south america and i started showing these different regulators look what the canadians are doing can we do the same thing here and that's exactly how i'm spending my time now trying to open up these new markets with the policies that have been put in place tested and proven that proven to work in canada it's always wonderful to see just the well-informed investors of the world uh with with uh this insane like uh respect and renownedness from their communities go down the crypto rabbit hole and turn into into crypto evangelists and kevin i was watching a podcast you did with uh uh our friend anthony pompliano uh where apparently uh earlier earlier in your guys relationships uh he said that he had 50 of his portfolio in bitcoin and you thought he was absolutely crazy for that uh but that was before you really went down the crypto rabbit hole so i'm wondering over the years as we've gone into like the 2020 to 2021 bull market but now into the 2022 bear market how your portfolio allocation into crypto has changed is it is it been like up only as in more and more crypto exposure over time or has it gone back and forth as the markets have changed how are you at 50 yet kevin yeah 50 50 or plus no basically what's happened to me is i've been layering in now for 36 months i started at two and a half percent went to seven then we went past 15. now in portfolio theory if you're running you know a mandate such as a sovereign fund let me give you the rules by which those big boys play and i'm using the same philosophy for crypto we have 11 sectors in the s p 500 portfolio theory would tell you never more than 20 in any one sector never more than 5 in any one stock or bond that's diversification and that's basically how 99 of sovereign wealth is managed by indexers like me and many others are like me and so i've done the same thing in crypto i've said okay i think crypto will be the 12th sector of the economy in 10 years i'm going to treat it that way now in the operating company that means i can put up to 20 of our operating capital into the crypto space and then i want diversification so i've basically done exactly that my largest holdings right now are ethereum and bitcoin that's not a big surprise but i also have a big position in in usdc big position in ftx as an equity which is a private company and then on down polygon i got involved with sandeep i liked his story i met him in dubai you know trying to reduce gas fees on top of ethereum makes a lot of sense for india and other countries like that like what he's doing i bought a piece of that love what's going on in all in the serum projects solana i'm a big fan of what you know sandbagman freight is doing these things all make sense to me but in the you know in the proportions of diversification now that portfolio i'd say about eight weeks ago was at 21 now it's down at about 18 there's been a big correction in the market but you've got to hold your nose and get used to the volatility and it let me it lets me just positions i can add a little bit to my usdc but my compliance department does doesn't consider usdc a money market or or a proxy for cash they consider it a highly volatile equity that's because of what's been going on in stablecoin so i'm limited to a five percent waiting there and i'm trying to get some policy while i'm here in washington remember we go right back to that give me one thing just give me policy on stable coins and let the market compete and i could put a lot more into that space because i've got a lot of cash on my operating company balance sheets and i have nowhere to put it and inflation is six seven eight percent and i'm getting 45 basis points in a bank that's really crazy i could do a lot more with stable coins so that's funny so you're saying even compliance is trading usdc which is a stable coin which is one-to-one pretty much one-to-one backed with money in a bank actual dollars in a bank you're saying that they're still treating that as a speculative asset so that's that's the challenge that's the challenge you can get your compliance department on board because they say show me the policy well there is no policy that's the problem is it fdic insured we don't have that yet we've really got to get this stuff nailed down that's why i keep telling everybody get behind policy because you're going to get a whole lot more capital into this space there's 52 billion already in usdc tethers out there that broke a buck so i can't touch that and of course luna was insanity well we now know algorithmic based stable coins well they don't work so well do they so the market will figure that out and they'll and they'll basically adjust accordingly based on risk and return so there's a number of different ways to get upside exposure in the crypto industry and i would imagine that you take every single way that you deem legitimate and like some of the easiest ways obviously are just buying the crypto monies like ether bitcoin uh which you said i think are your perhaps your biggest exposures but there's like other strategies too like yield farming with stable coins uh but then there's also buying crypto equities like ftx or coin stock uh but then there's also uh angel investments in private private market investments and i'm wondering how you weight all of these things and if there's any other categories that i missed that that are worth mentioning as well just how do you weight these things with your attention and with your capital well obviously when new projects come to market i'm very fortunate i see pretty well every deal and there's a reason for that there's a direct correlation between market capitalization and telling the company's story everybody knows i have millions of followers millions of investors and i like to talk about the cooking i eat i mean i i don't invest in projects that i don't use i don't care whether it's a product or it's a crypto product or whatever you don't see me in a lot of these very speculative tokens because i don't use them i'm looking for value there i'm intrigued by the nft market in authentication of physical assets around the watch industry that's a space i'm very involved in that's a private investment along with other giant collectors and watch makers and horological societies but that's just my personal interest so it's the things that i really that i really want to dig into that i invest in but you're right there's a lot of room for private projects because you know i look at it this way you talk to any grad coming out of mit or waterloo or temple or mcgill or any of these really high in engineering colleges and universities and a third of the engineers all want to go onto the blockchain you can't take that much intellectual capital and not expect some incredible outcomes three to five years from now so you want to invest in some of these people these are the smartest hands-over keyboards all around the world they're not working for the traditional industries they're on the chain and that means there's going to be a lot of productivity there that's what you want to bet on it's like betting on steve jobs when he was just drawing fonts with a felt pen that kind of idea it's the same thing going on now these guys are going to be big productivity for the economy and you've got to put your money behind them but some people will say kevin uh but look at the bear market okay the bubble just bursts they'll point to luna of course but then they'll even point to bitcoin right now which is down 60 percent ethereum down 65 percent the solana's in the and the polygons of the world down 85 plus and they'll and they'll say look uh you know this asset space is too volatile normal investors you know shouldn't get exposure to this space it's it's too risky all of these things some some will even say as this bear market continues i'm sure that uh that crypto is dead the way they said that in 2018 and 2019 what's your response to those kind of criticisms and should we be concerned about the bear market i think i read a quote by the way uh kevin you called it nightmarish and i think for people it's their first time on the merry-go-round here the crypto merry-go-round this is a ride for them that they don't want to be on they're starting to get nauseous what's uh what are your thoughts on the bear market what do you tell people about this well you know i i give an example that everybody can relate to because in the early years of amazon 18 years ago i was a shareholder both in the equity and in the preference shares they used to have in those days that stock corrected every 12 to 18 months between 38 and 58 every single year over and over and over again people just couldn't get their heads around what amazon was doing and it continued that way for a decade it's no different than what's going on right now with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because there's no institutional demand yet for the product people keep saying institutions are involved but they're not not at all and so if we get one of these bills passed here in washington which is why i'm here i would love to see this agenda item move forward so it can be decided on after the midterms i'm sure biden's very very busy on other issues right now but this isn't going away and these senators and congressmen and women know this and that's why they're bringing these and advancing them all of these senators are all over cable tv today talking about this bill dropping and it's not the only one and certainly many of them will be discussing it in the weeks ahead but the point is as an investor do you want to be ahead of this or behind it because i think what happens is you get a binary increase in the value of crypto the minute people even sense policy and that's going to happen sometime jan feb march and so i want to be positioned before then you don't have to but i think it's the way to go in terms of being early and niacin it's like being involved in the internet in its most early days same thing is going on here long term it's a great investment but boy volatility yeah it's tough 50 percent up 50 down 60 swings well that was amazon 12 15 years ago now it's bitcoin today what would you say are the obstacles preventing good legislation from getting through in capitol hill like why isn't this a slam dunk because if you're in the crypto space like we're just asking for like very basic good legislation and from our perception it's obvious what needs to happen and this says there's some crazy low-hanging fruit things like stable coins perhaps not being securities that seem so trivial what's getting in the way like who's getting in who's presenting obstacles for us like why can't we just have a slam dunk legislation around crypto clarity one word education this is the most misunderstood sector of the economy that's ever existed because of the complexity of how it works basically policymakers do not understand it and when you don't understand something you tend to mistrust it it requires education it's taken me years and a lot of hours of reading and a tremendous amount of travel to get to the place where i'm comfortable making these investments now and understand how this works but that's not easy to do and and the whole idea of a centralized and decentralized wallet very many people don't understand the differences between it and yet you need both in the crypto environment you really want both one of the biggest investment thesis i have about investing in wonderful was it gave me both there's a decentralized wallet there's a centralized wallet and i don't want to lose those customers if all of a sudden you started by setting yourself up on bit by which is the canadian regulated centralized wallet and all of a sudden you decided you want to have a decentralized wallet with your nfts in it i want to lose you as a customer i spent hundreds of dollars acquiring you i want to offer both with a know your customer platform that provides the compliance and that's what they're building up there in canada and that software itself and all the millions of dollars of development they're doing is going to be cookie cutter for other markets like potentially the middle east or south america or switzerland or england that's the whole idea of being part of these things and pushing these projects forward but it's education that's holding everybody back we've got to simplify this stuff most people the first time that try and set up a decentralized wallet on let's say metamask lose their money because they don't know about security of the passphrase and that's an important lesson to learn and that's why i tell people start with 200 don't go crazy figure this stuff out slowly learn about security learn about password protocols learn about centralized versus decentralized check it out slowly baby steps into it then you can put up real money so what is your advice for someone who wants to get educated is it just that you have to you have to start using these applications i mean i i think a lot of people in the early days of the internet didn't understand the internet until the first time you know they typed in a google search or they received an email or something like that that's how the internet was propagated what's your advice for someone who's new to crypto and wants to get started is it just start using these protocols how did you school up on it kevin it was really out of need i mean usdc for example and and what circle has done with their corporate accounts you know i was very early on that platform uh spent a lot of time with management talking about how we could make this work with compliance departments how we could make it work with audit firms because the first thing that happens when you take a new asset class and you call up your auditor or your regulator or your compliance department say look i want to transfer five percent of our cash into usdc they say what where's the compliance infrastructure that marks to market that at four o'clock when the market ends i said there is no market end for crypto there's no beginning there's no end it's just trading 24 7. and there's no infrastructure and that that is very uncomfortable when your compliance department is used to just looking at your mark to market positions at 401 and saying hey that position is a six percent waiting it's got to get sold down to five tomorrow morning or you put too much leverage on that position that's how the world works we don't have the infrastructure yet and so i tell people look start slowly now for me usdc has become a very powerful payment system many and more and more time is going by inventors are willing to take it i'm willing to take it but people want to pay me for goods and services in other countries i say give me usdc if you're allowed to don't ach me any capital out of a bank don't send me swiss francs euros or british pounds that's just a total headache for me go figure out usdc and i'll take the risk myself on it but you know that's going to take a long time to happen i tell everybody this is the future of currency it's the future of payment systems it's the 12 sector the economy get over it and start learning about it you know before the pandemic if you were 65 years old sitting in a condo in miami beach and you never used your phone to order groceries well now you do because otherwise you would have starved to death you couldn't go to the grocery store you figured out how to download one of those apps and start ordering food and now you're totally hip to it and you live your life on your phone and that was because you had to the same thing's going to happen in cryptocurrencies the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's

get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum notes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there kevin i just gotta say man i love that you're in the space like on behalf of david and i've been doing crypto education doing this podcast for a long time and you are reaching an entirely different demographic than than we will and it's so cool to have you saying the same thing using different words and reaching other people about this and i think that's your skill set it's really uh telling stories and spreading a narrative i'm curious where you see your brand the you know the mr wonderful kevin o'leary brand in crypto what are you here what are you here trying to do is to spread awareness are you trying to build product what's uh what's your brand in crypto going to be my brand is about compliance my brand's about institutions my brand's about allocation and diversification about investing and so i'm able to have those conversations with regulators they know me already i can get the meeting in any country in the world i can meet the head of a of a bank in the middle east and sit down with the ceo and say look here's a compliance strategy to bring your world into crypto let's work together because i'm a hundred percent compliant i am not a crypto cowboy i'm talking about bringing the real money into crypto the real sovereign wealth and so for everybody that used to criticize me about saying let's get this thing regulated now they understand why they want to get it regulated too it's the trillion dollars that'll come into this market overnight when it's regulated and i'm just one of those people out there trying to make that happen and so yes it's baby steps but if you're sitting down with the head of a bank that's got five million accounts and a trillion dollars sitting in those accounts they're not interested in being a crypto cowboy either they don't want to be offside with their regulator they want to work on a compliant basis and make sure their internal compliance is completely 100 percent nailed down so they can report to their regulator and not be offside that's the kind of people i want to work with that's what my brand's about and i am on that mission if you want to call it that for the benefit of everybody in crypto because if we can get this policy nailed down everybody benefits everybody values go up i'll bring that to the table everything goes up in value because the real money will come in i alluded to earlier how you were skeptical about crypto in 2017 2018 which really makes sense because that era of crypto was really just the wild west uh famously you know we call ours many people in the crypto industry crypto degens like crypto degenerates they're gambling all their money they're not paying attention to securities laws uh but now going into 2020 and beyond like we have actually figured out fundamental utility that has attracted fundamental investors like yourself into this base uh and i think what you're telling me kevin is that crypto is ready to really grow up and really get mature and really start bringing in capital from people who would have been turned off by the wild west of 2017 and 2018 but are turned on by the more sustainable yields the more sustainable utilities and use cases that crypto brings and you alluded to it a little bit but i'd like you to go into it a little bit more you know prices go up when crypto matures because it brings in not just you know billions of capital but trillions of capital from from all over the world can you just a picture give us that paint that picture of crypto in 2023 and 2024 as we get regulatory clarity as we get more comfortable with with uh bigger institutions why is this good for the crypto industry and why does it need to happen for us make us bullish kevin well look i'm going to lay it out the way i see it and the way i'm investing all right what's going to happen is nothing before the midterms but we're getting close after the midterms when the house is settled and who knows what it'll look like but i have a pretty good idea we're going to get some policy and the first policy in my opinion personal opinion here is going to be around stable coins and here's what it's going to look like it's going to be an open competitive market just like you can find a money market a schwab or a money market at fidelity or a money market or some other financial institution they're slightly different you know stable coins are payment systems but they're also stores of value if you're willing to stake them out you can make four and a half percent on an annualized basis on a 30-day contract today right now on usdc and other stable coins but here's the policy i see coming it's going to look like this 30-day audit on the assets underneath it you can bring any kind of stable coin you want but there's going to be a 30-day audit and what's in there no assets supporting the token or coin with a duration more than 12 months so if you're going to use t-bills they got to be short duration probably average of six months duration and that's very much like a money market is run and completely fdic insured there may even be one or two of these stable coin operators that apply to become a bank and become fdic in short in which case they would get trillions of dollars and the reason this is going to happen first why the stable coin market will happen first with policymakers here in washington is that it perpetuates the us dollar as the default currency of the globe when we get that worked out the u.s dollar becomes king dollar in perpetuity even other countries even other sovereigns are willing to bring tokens out back by the us dollar because they know in terms of attracting people to use them and store them and save them they gotta have the king dollar and this is why policymakers should get off their you know what's and get this thing done because we don't want the chinese doing that with the one i would never buy the chinese one as a stable coin why because i know they're watching it i don't want them watching my dollars and i don't trust that currency i trust the us dollar so i wouldn't like to find out the swiss franc did that before us we got to get this thing done and make the us dollar king dollar all around the world everybody will be happy with a product that is backed by the us dollar one to one is liquid transparent you can transfer immediately with a full ledger and finally i could say to my compliance department look we finally have policy let me go to a ten percent waiting in this as opposed to locking me down at five and they probably could get there because they may consider it a cash equivalent at some point very similar to money market accounts that very rarely break a buck that's the whole idea and that's what will happen next then we'll get policy on bitcoin then we'll get policy on other chains okay we'll start to debate is you know solana a commodity or solana security what about the nfts one by one will knock these puppies down and that's the way it should be but we don't want to try and solve everything all at once we'll never get it done we'll never get it done one thing at a time let's start with stable coins that's a great road map and i do think stable coins are the big win for the us government so hopefully all of the regulators and government officials who are listening to this heard the pitch from kevin and if you're a crypto native and you're still skeptical and you're saying we don't want government to touch this tech remember what david and i always say on bankless when they adopt crypto protocols they adopt crypto values okay building on top of this infrastructure the value fundamentally goes to the value of bitcoin ethers of the world and so that is exactly what we want to promote a more bankless decentralized future kevin it's been so much fun having you man as a follow-up i know an action item i think people should really go check out what you're doing over at wonderful because this feels like a defy laboratory of sorts and it's almost like it seems like a product studio can you tell us a little bit about wonder what wonderfulize is cooking up in your interest there as we close wonderful is a public company it trades on the neo exchange in canada or the regulator was the first to allow crypto exchanges like that and etfs and ethereum and bitcoin based you know securities of trade as etfs and so it's a great place to invest but what wondrfi has done which is unique is they have decentralized and centralized wallets they've got 800 000 accounts now across the canadian market every canadian can legitimately trade compliant crypto now they can take cash out of their banks transfer it in they can take fiat currency and buy bitcoin buy ethereum buy whatever they wish and trade it on on wonderfuy and then bit by platform they're all part of it it's one of my biggest investments in in infrastructure in crypto and i love the management team i think they're doing a fantastic job and i'm an ambassador for them here in washington ambassador for them overseas i keep you know touting about the the technology they've got the compliant technology and and a lot of big banks overseas are interested in seeing how this works because they've proven it works in the canadian market 800 000 times very few firms have done that on a compliant basis guys we will include a link to uh wonderful in the show notes and of course it sounds like canada is exporting all of these fantastic things maybe some compliance and regulatory to the us canada's certainly given us vitalik buterin so but i don't know if they can top that but uh we appreciate you coming on kevin and telling us about your interest in crypto and where the industry is going thanks a lot for joining us take care guys
