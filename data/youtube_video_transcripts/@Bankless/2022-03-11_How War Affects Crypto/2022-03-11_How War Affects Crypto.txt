how are supply chains being stressed by just the events of the last like 14 days or so you know russia and ukraine are such big components of the commodities market and so i just think that you're seeing pressure again on supply chains and pressure again on the functionality of them do you have a perspective on how this affects crypto of course crypto is sort of a risk-on asset and yet it's also supposed to be this non-sovereign store of value that means it can't be censored by a central government it can be an outlet for the people whether they're ukrainian or whether they're russian russia is not going to use crypto to obey sanctions like that's just not something that you can do on a public ledger but you have seen like ukrainians and russian people being able to use crypto to you know save and store their wealth which i think is super important but then you've also seen this broader question around a decentralized asset on a decentralized exchange and what role does that centralized exchange like coinbase play and complying with sanctions
