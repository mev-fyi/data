time time is money once you realize that time has value then it should start becoming immediately clear that taking interest rates the price of time down to zero is highly unnatural it would be like depriving an animal of oxygen and taking them to negative becomes almost insane welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless we're living in this era of central Banker capitalism we have low interest rates everything bubbles is this new for Humanity what does history tell us might happen next today we have Financial historian Edward Chancellor who's going to help us answer these questions and along the way we learn Timeless lessons about interest debt and a time value of money a few takeaways for you bankless Nation number one we talk about what causes bubbles is it low interest rates or The Madness of crowds we've certainly seen a lot of both in our crypto Journey number two can we get away from bubbles are they just part of our DNA number three what happens when that natural rate of interest becomes unnatural number four after Decades of studying the history of money and finance who does Edward think is right the keynesians or the austrians number five what does Edward Chancellor think of crypto how do they relate to Central Bank digital currencies really spicy takes near the end and number six what happens next that's what we're all trying to figure out David what's the significance of this episode what should folks get out of this for Bangladesh listeners that have been paying attention I've brought up this book devil take the hindmost throughout a handful of Vanquis podcasts Edward Chancellor is the author of Double Take the hindmost so one of my favorite books about money and finance that I think teaches us really important lessons and he's also written a more recent book called the price of time which is a study of interest rates and I really think these two books are Yin and Yang they're two sides of the same coin and today on on bankless uh where we talk about the frontier of money and finance we're actually talking about the history of money in finance up to up to this point and I think really why this episode is so significant and why Edward as a financial historian is so significant is that it's about money it's about Finance but it's also about humans it's also about the interest psychic layer of what makes these things happen because again money it's just a story that we tell ourselves Finance exists in the minds of humans and so Edward does a great great job just running through history and watching humans try to contend with these things that we've created these naturally emergent phenomenon like interest rates and financial Bubbles and so I think without a complete picture of understanding money and finance that goes down into the human level the sociological level It's actually an incomplete story and so I think Edward can probably give us I think he gave us the most comprehensive unabridged articulation of the progress of money and finance because he added he has in that social layer and then we when we get to the end and we ask him about his current opinions in the modern day uh state of things State of Affairs including this new player in the game crypto he is an older historian he's seen some decades but he really resonates with the crypto story and I thought that that was particularly interesting it's it's very cool he resonates in particularly with his idea of money as Freedom technology which which is when we get it right that it can bring freedom to the world and that's certainly something that the crypto story resonates with also David he's just a delight to listen to you mentioned he's from an older generation a generation that uses words like skullduggery and naves so just an absolute Delight to listen to and talk with and as usual all bankless citizens have access to the debrief episode which is the episode that Dave and I are about to

historian a journalist and an author of two of my favorite books linking together the history of money and finance and and human culture the first book devil take the hindmost a history of financial speculation I've brought up a handful of times across other podcast episodes and this one explores the history of financial bubbles in their underlying causes in Edward's newest book the price of time the real story of interest is a similar book in which it explores the story of interest from its root to the modern day and how our relationship with interest has developed so today on this episode we are going to explore in which the ways of money and finance is embedded deeper into our lives than we have previously thought Edward welcome to bankless please be with you Edward um these two books price of time devil take the hindmost they focus on different things but I I want to start and open up this conversation about where they actually overlap um one is about financial bubbles the other is the story of interest rates but if these were two Venn diagrams how would you define the overlap between these two things what do these two books have in common um well the overlap is most clearly in the area of financial speculation and Bubbles um the first book devil take the Hamas deals with a with a looks at a variety of different bubbles over time and examine some in in different ways what generates the bubble and for instance you might get new technologies or you might um technology is the most obvious example but there are other types of bubbles who get real estate Bubbles and so forth um and that was written in the 1990s when the Tech bubbles.com bubble was beginning to take off the second book is exclusively about interest and the role that interest plays and and what happens when interest rates in particular fought very low levels and what I that also has a lot of discussion of speculative bubbles historically uh and and and up to the recent day and what I argue in the second book is that you can um you could you could the focus on speculative bubbles from an academic perspective in the last 20 odd years has been on behavioral Finance for people going crazy the map what you call The Madness of crowds what I'm trying to draw attention to in the in the new book is how very low interest rates are a main cause of speculative bubbles so it's sort of I don't have any discussion really of speculative of a behavioral Finance or of irrational exuberance in the new book I simply go back and look at some of the same cases I do in the first book such as the Tulip Mania or in Holland at the 1630s and what I hadn't realized when I wrote the first book is it actually the in Holland in the 1630s was was a period of falling interest rates and of a massive increase in the Dutch money supply created by uh the Central Bank uh the Dutch had a central bank who's at the time called the visible bank which was founded in at the beginning of the of the 17th century and the visual Bank actually issued notes paper notes backed by gold currency so in principle it couldn't create credit but it's its notes were so popular that foreigners brought their money to Holland and the um and and so you saw an increase in the paper supply of money and falling interest rates and that coincided with this great speculative bubble the first great expected bubble in tulip in in tulips and then um I look at a series of other bubbles in the second book most notably as you know the uh and in most detail the the bubble created by John Law the Scottish adventurer who founded the Mississippi company in France in the 1710s and who also um established the first French Central Bank that issued a pure paperback currency and lowered interest rates we can talk about that a bit later and then really the discussion of Specter Bubbles and interest rates and second book goes right up to what we've been living through in recent years the the so-called everything bubble which as Charlie Munger the Warren Buffett's partner said back in 2020 was the most extraordinary episode in the history of finance and I've read quite a lot of the history of Finance over the years now I'm inclined to agree with with manga well we're definitely going to zero into that part of the conversation towards uh the end of this podcast but um first I want to uh articulate to you why these books are so meaningful to me and get your Reflections on it um to me both of these books are about like natural Financial phenomena um interest rates is like a naturally occurring phenomenon and same thing with these Financial bubbles I think anyone who reads double takes the hindmost uh will immediately realize that humans will create Financial bubbles when you leave them to up to their own devices and so to me the the the your journey on in writing these books has always been to explore like Once Upon a Time humans created money and finance and the progression of money and finance has been like us trying to figure out what to do about that and slowly iterating towards the future by making many mistakes along the way uh but then inevitably do like making progress in the world of money and finance that's why I enter interpretation of of these books how would you reflect on that yeah I think that's a reasonable way of categorizing it um our spec to Bubbles inevitable and the answer is probably yes um and I think in particular say when you get a new technology who's whose outcome is uncertain and there's a need to try out different sort of business models that need to draw in a lot of capital to explore the new technology uh and the new technology doesn't probably doesn't have the the cash flow um that you can you know the uh a cash flow that you can latch upon to ascertain what its fundamental value will be so I think what I say in the first book Is that the speculative bubbles bring on the new technologies such as railroads in the 19th century or motor cars or radio in the in the 1920s and internet uh technology in in the in the tooth in the 1990s early 2000s but is it doesn't tend to be a very good deal for the investors or speculators in the new technology um and it tends to once the bubble has has collapsed tends to really result in a transfer of wealth from the speculators to the consumers who get the new the new Services of the technology and if you will at a discounted price and that book was published devote at the time is published in 99 and so the.com bubble TMT bubble as we call it technology media and Telecommunications bubble hadn't hadn't quite come to an end it had about at about sort of eight nine months left to run but there you we have quite a nice um case that demonstrates the argument of the book because if you remember there was massive investment in fiber optic cables that were necessary to carry the new uh data for the internet data and that was based uh on at the time in the late 1990s on forecast for data traffic growth that were massively exaggerated and we had tremendous over investment in fiber optic cable and shortly afterwards um there was then a slew of telecoms bankruptcies including the massive uh world-com bankruptcy and we were left with 95 excess capacity in fiber optic cable and that really uh was you know as I said not not a great deal for investors but pretty good for um people who were starting up Tech firms and consumers of of internet technology in the early 2000s so you could say it's a misallocation of capital but it also provides the backbone for the new technology to take place so there's a case in which if you will the the bubble is serving a function but just not serving the speculators specific Financial requirements go to the nature of Interest as you say this is a is some something that is is natural to to man Mankind and I argue in the book as as you know the interest arises at right at the dawn of History we have sort of records of of Interest being charged five million years ago and in fact if you look into the ancient languages you find that the word for interest uh in most of the ancient languages of the near East was related to The Offspring of of livestock of cattle of sheep um and goats and that what that suggests is that the early farmers in sort of prehistoric periods were lending out um their livestock and their grains and demanding an interest payments so the fact that interest is just so much older than even money uh is it telling you how fundamental it is to human uh activity but we also a great body of the of the of the study of Interest has been around what economists call time preference and time preference is the notion that human beings are naturally impatient we are um we are mortal and we prefer to have things today rather than at some stage in the future so the reason I called the book the price of time is because really what interest is is the difference in value between a dollar today and a dollar in a year's time and you can see that you know in finance we talk about that as as discounting and the sort of discounting of future Pleasures is a um is an inherently psychological phenomenon it seems to be again natural a natural phenomenon so going into the details of the prices time at the beginning it tells a story at like the very beginning of Interest as in like humans discovering interest humans were skeptical um we called it usury right and this the idea of it was it was closer to the um it was closer to exploitation than it was alone so I I'm wondering if you can kind of illustrate why humans had this like distrusting relationship with interest in the early days and as our relationship with interest progressed how we got over that obstacle well um we haven't really completely got over it as I point out well that's funny because that's where my next question was uh you know the as I point out in the book you get criticisms of lending at interest for instance in the in the Bible um at the Greek philosopher philosophers such as Aristotle said that interest was illicit he said that money uh was to be used in exchange but not to gain uh through lending and that criticism then informed the sort of the early church period um and then you know the medieval Church through to let's say the you know the early modern period birth of capitalism um why is there such dislike of of Interest I think partly legitimate if you are um in a in a traditional rural um society and economy that has no economic growth uh then the Lending at interest at high rates of Interest quickly takes people into a position of over indebtedness and in the ancient world that could lead to people being taken into debt bondage and ultimately slavery and in fact there's some argument that that lenders deliberately lent in order to enslave people through their High interest loans and then there's this the the problem of compound interest that interest of debts accruing at a high compound rate over a number of years and that also that's really what gets people into to deep trouble compound interest over a long period is a it's a phenomen that's impossible to overcome there is I think in the 18th century um someone a a British um statistician calculated that if a a gold Sovereign had been lend at the time of our Lord and compounded at two percent a year or thereabouts by the mid-18th century that the gold would have grown to two and a half Globes the size of the Earth so you can see that you can't really compound um you can't really compound loans at even a relatively small rate over a long period of time without the debt coming insufferable so in the in the in the ancient world they had these things called caudette jubilees which is the Forgiveness of debt uh the Israelites I think had debt jubilees every 50 year the Greeks had occasional jubilees the famous uh Athenian law Giver so long uh actually it came to power at a time when lenders were had taken a lot had more had had taken a lot of land through mortgage inches and he forgave the debts and in the in in Babylon New rulers would um would would forgive debts when they came to power so the Jubilee is is a or the Forgiveness of debts that have been compounding was was a feature of the ancient world but you still need interest I mean you may have it too high but but Aristotle got it wrong when he said that interest you know money does is not to increase through loan he doesn't consider what I just mentioned before this the time dimension of the loan it's quite clear that if I was to give you a dollar and ask for it immediately back it would be exploitative and unjust to demand more than I'd given but I would give you some of money and you give it back to me after a period of time and you use that loan to buy a house or or engagement business or or whatever that is profitable to you it's perfectly reasonable that I should demand some share of the profit and in fact without interest there's you could there are seven things you can't do you can't fund businesses for instance the ancient nearest uh low um voyages Merchants voyages were funded with loans the real estate market in Mesopotamia was funded with lens so you need the interest in order to provide quite basic functions and of course and of course I forgot to mention that of course in in the ancient near East loans of grain were also used for agricultural purposes just as Farmers borrow today to to farm so so you need it and then eventually by let's say the 16th century capitalism has become so well established in Europe uh with Merchants trading across Europe and using uh credit instruments that embed a rate of interest that it becomes really um futile to continue with these um religious strictures against interest and at the time of the Reformation in the early 16th century there is a um a shift in the religious attitude towards usury Martin Luther actually was rather old-fashioned in this respect and continued to denounce lending at interest but John Calvin in in in in in Geneva not surprisingly home for Bankers uh was actually uh favorable towards charging interest and so from the from the 16th century the argument is not so much where the interest is legitimate or not it's just as some that then continues an argument I suppose we can my book is um continues adapt to the current days is what should the rate of interest be not not should there be any interest charge but what should the rate of interest be that is the question and I think that's a very uh modern question as well it's it's one we grapple with and we want to come back to this idea in a minute um Edward of the kind of the everything bubble because this might be uh I think you are you're hinting at this might be an interest a rape problem but but just back on that kind of line of thought it seems like what you're telling us is interest is deep it's fundamental it's necessary for society it's even um an earlier form of social technology than money which is something we've talked about a lot on Bank lists so Society recognizes throughout the ages it needs interest and yet we also recognize that after a certain amount of time it kind of its utility erodes or needs to be kept in check because of this network effect of compounding interest maybe some other effects so power and wealth accruals a cruise to a degree such that a society can no longer tolerate it and so we have things that we've embedded in our social protocols like debt jubilees just white wipe the Slate clean we also have of religious protocols that just say no that interesting we've tried that before it's bad it's morally wrong so let's try to limit it that way so there have been ways that societies have tried to contain it into uh into a box and there's this recognition that interest can go wrong and it can go wrong after you know some period of time in many different ways I want to ask you the question Edward do you feel like we are living in a time where interest has gone in the wrong direction I mean it seems like societies and civilizations across history have had to hit the reset button or have had to do something to kind of rein in interest after one particular time and maybe I'm using the wrong word maybe what I really mean is debt rather than interest but these two terms are kind of interrelated so tell us about like the modern times we live in in this in this uh everything bubble I mean you indicated that it was maybe caused this everything bubble is maybe caused more by low interest rates rather than The Madness of crowds that is very popular to uh you know to ascribe these things to the meme stocks and that sort of thing anyway link these together for us and tell us is the everything bubble a symptom of Interest gone awry um yes but let's get back to the earlier point you were making about interest and and debt and and jubilees and debt jubilees um one definite definition of interest is the pretty obvious the price of Leverage the amount a person pays on a lend by definition and as interest comes down you get more leverage in the system so the the problem isn't the compounding of interest at a time of falling interest the problem is the compounding of debt and we have been living through a period in which debt has continued inexorably to rise and some people refer to this as the debt super cycle and the debt super cycle has been interrupted on occasion by various Financial crises and bus of which the most the latest and most severe was the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 and after each crisis we have taken interest rates down lower and after each crisis debt has continued to rise higher and that is problematic for society there has been a a shift in the uh in who is responsible for the debt and the sort of creditor base since the GFC the GFC was largely a a created by the collapse of private sector credit and revealed excess indebtedness of the private sector particularly you know starting with U.S households but but also you know Wall Street Banks and so forth in the subsequent period there have been some reduction in private sector debt relative to income but a massive increase as you know in the government debt so the overall debt has increased but the uh portion of public debt has massively increased what is the end point uh in in the mod in the modern world of world of Fiat currencies is not a debt Jubilee that Jubilee is um a bit too complicated a bit too bold for our modern world too many vested interests are directly attacked if debt worth given and I suppose it would you know lead to widespread and rather uncontrolled bankruptcies so in the modern world we have an alternative to that jubilees which is inflation and the inflation reduces the real value of the debt over time and that becomes the adjustment process inflation as the modern example of debt Jubilee that is so interesting the slow Jubilee so so a debt Jubilee in um civilizations past has been you completely wipe The Ledger no one owes anyone anything anymore all debts go to zero can can you link this because you know the term inflation is misunderstood how is this similar to debt Jubilee Edward well it's a inflation just quietly erodes the value of debt it's you know they as they say it's a a thief in the night um there is a the economists have a term for this um Financial repression and financial repression is when the rate of interest is held below the level of inflation and that serves to erode the value of the debt now for instance after the really after both world wars we had periods well after the first world war in Europe in certain countries in Europe France uh Germany Austria Hungary we had high inflation in France and hyperinflation in these other countries that wiped out the value of the debt after the second world war you again had inflation in in Europe and in Japan to wipe out the war deaths but the British and the Americans went through a prolonged period of of financial repression in which roughly half their War debts were paid off by inflation rather than through repayment of the debts or by growth in GDP it was it was the eradication of debt through inflation and that that I think is the norm of the modern world and if you think about it over the last year people have been pointing out that interest rates are rising but if you actually look at a chart of real interest rates real interest rates have been lower in over the last year than they were ever were during the so-called great inflation of the 1970s so uh that you know so already that process of financial repression kicking in and the debt burden will start to decline and I'm not saying you know inflation difficult to predict the path of the inflation difficult to predict but I think the base case for thinking about our um the you know our future the current debt burden is that uh it will mostly to a large extent be paid off via inflation through an inflation debt Jubilee I think there's um two ways that you could kind of listen to this you know one is um you can kind of listen to what you're saying Edward and playing for the future as a result make sense of the world around you and kind of what's happening with the financial markets and with Society knowing that there's this inflationary type of of debt Jubilee that is in process right now but but another question I have from uh I guess maybe your your historical perspective here is oftentimes inflation is painted as as the enemy um and I'm wondering if if your perspective uh you know paints inflation in a different light is it is it like necessary that we have inflation for the functioning of society and and kind of wipe parts of the debt every uh every so often is that kind of the macro picture of things like what would you do without inflation uh Society would not be able to function what's what's your take on this so you know I agree with what you you say um I think you know I'm no great friend of inflation in itself I would like you need to have a stable money I'd like to have a stable Financial system for that matter um however at different times people's approach to inflation varies if you're starting from a position of high debt let's say high public sector debt that can only be paid off through either economic growth or higher Taxation and let's assume forget about the economic growth for a while then let's just say the debt is going to be a burden on the taxpayer and the interest payments are better the taxpayer then obviously there's an interest in the taxpayer not being overburdened in recent years there have been um the beneficiaries with extremely low interest rates have been the corporations whose profits have grown whose profit shares grain relative to the labor share so corporations have done better relative workers and older people have done better relative to younger people because older people tend to own their own houses tend to have collected you've done the bulk of their savings and as is interest rates fell the assets the older people owned Rose in value the low interest rate environment has benefited people in the financial sector bankers and professional investors who've generated more fees relative to workers and you know to Executives in what you might call the the real economy but it obviously the low interest rates also through the enhanced value of stock based compensation benefited Senior Management so you can see that a period of higher inflation accompanied by Rising interest rates but not so high that they actually bring the system down and that not so high that they actually make it difficult to pay off the debt but higher inflation and slightly higher interest rates would benefit different different parts of society so I'm thinking that you know we're already seeing the low low wage people having earnings growth exceeding levels of inflation and the better paid people their real pay their real earnings income is beginning to decline we haven't yet seen this feed through into falling corporate profits but it's quite likely we'll see polling corporate profits at some stage and you know obviously last year massive sell-off in the bond and Global Equity markets and so again valuations for become lower and that means that younger people who's starting to save are going to get higher Returns on their savings at the expense of those who already had it so there are a number of ways in which inflation will benefit quite large and influential sectors in in societies one way of seeing inflation is really a a battle among uh groups of society for a larger slice of the cake and and there's a great American Economist called manka Olsen who wrote a book called The Rise and decline of nations in which he says inflation comes back through what he calls distributional struggles I think so that's the early stages of inflation I think once inflation has sort of done its trick say paying down the debt and once inflation has run out of control then it becomes unpopular with a broader and broader section of the population until at a certain point the political will is there to bring inflation to an end and we go back to say German hyperinflation the whole thing happened in a relatively brief sort of two-year period but at the end they just had a a monetary and fiscal reform in November 1923 and inflation just stopped dead in its tracks if you think of the late 1970s Paul volcker the FED chairman jacked up inflation to a sort of jacked up the FED funds rate uh into the mid teens and there was a you know two pretty severe recessions in the U.S but but that there was really a consensus that that was necessary to get the inflation out of the system but they only wanted to get the inflation out of the system by the time U.S government debt had had collapsed to idle him less than 30 of GDP or whatever so um so it just takes time so I mean people I think look on inflation uh in a rather simplistic way as if it's always unfair but but it presumes that the situation the the distribution of of of income and wealth when inflation starts is fair and that's often not the case so it's never been Fair we're just squeezing out where the unfairness lies the different kind of populations and demographics taking turns of unfairness I think so yes I mean say look famously you know um I mean um it points out the the problems of inflation but he also certain stage famously calls for what he calls what he says is that the euthanasia of the rontier theonte being the bond holder and um you know the bondholders often have no no friends so um a bit of euthanasia uh is sometimes in order there's uh Edward a theme in the price of time book um that is about the tug of war between what you call what we call the natural rate of interest and then the implicitly the implied unnatural rate of interest um there's this natural rate that's set by the market and then there is this rate of interest that the financial operators of an economy can divert away from so like as a concept can you just Define the natural rate of interest for people and then illuminate the patterns of economies that go forth win the natural rate of interest is diverted from okay so I I already have um two ideas of how you might Define the natural rate one is just as you alluded to earlier the market rate of interest and market rate of interest would really appear in a world in which the you know money was constrained in Supply and therefore you know like any other like any other good and therefore the rate the market rate of interest would be the price for transferring a limited amount of loanable funds and it would reflect supply and demand for learnable funds and I think that's probably what you had let's say before the beginning of of modern banking let's say in the sort of in mid mid 17th century trouble is that once as you as you know Banks what we call fractional Reserve Banks say taking a deposit and then they lend out the deposit and through the act of lending out the deposit they actually create a new deposit and that new deposit creates new money so the there is no um fundamental restriction on the growth of the money supply and then that's rendered more complicated when you get into World modern Central Banking when you sever the connection of Central Bank Reserves from a um from gold from a limited commodity precious metal so then you get really two forms of of of fear of created money the credit money of the banking system and the Fiat money of the central banking system so now money is no longer really constrained so if no money is no longer really constrained in its Supply what then is the market rate of interest does it reflect really people's time preferences and companies marginal return on Capital I probably not it Just reflects the activities of the banking system so does the then in a modern economy does the market rate does it do the rate of interests rates of interest that Prevail are they reflect to the Natural rate you know what what what the ideal rate of interest would be and I would say no um and I I think one of the one of the points the book tries to make is that there is a the conventional wisdom among monetary economists and Central Bankers is oh we know where the rate of interest is it's the rate at which there's no inflation and there's no deflation it's the sort of Sweet Spot between those two positions Edward this is Central Bank monetary policy they want you know two percent uh CPI inflation basically and they're trying to adjust their thermometer you know in terms of monetary policy to accommodate that exactly and during the last decade as you know the central Bankers took interest rates down to the lowest level in history massively expanded their balance sheets with quantitative easing and engaged in a whole number of other sort of Tricks Hocus Pocus you know operation twists whatever in order to manipulate both short and long term rates to the level to the level at which they could meet their inflation Target and they did more or less throughout the post-crisis period in Europe and the United States inflation was sort of roughly around the two percent Target and so the the central Bankers would say you know we did a good job we we brought the great the Great Recession to an end there was no repeater the Great Depression unemployment came down and we we met our inflation Target so you know what's what's wrong what's not to like and I'm saying well actually hang on a sec perhaps this inflation Target is you know not all the not all that it seems and for that argument I go back to a critique of the earliest iteration of inflation targeting that occurred in the 1920s which was then known as price stability and that was really just sort of zero percent inflation but sort of roughly the same thing and the the young Austrian Economist Friedrich Hayek who was at the time in the early 20s was actually starting his PhD thesis on Central Bank policy the FED Central Bank policy it at NYU um Hayek made this what should really seem like a pretty obvious point is that in an economy with with productivity growth with new technologies that that actually deliver productivity growth that improve efficiencies of production then the natural tendency of the price level would be to decline and so actually the time of of productivity growth in a modern capitalist Society you should see a mild or possibly sometimes even stronger decline in the price level just like we used to expect you know computer prices to come down every year and what Hayek then argued is well if you aim at stable prices and you can stand the argument of the modern day if you aim at a a two percent inflation Target at a time of productivity boom and we could also sometimes people refer to it not so much as a productivity Bloom but as a benign supply-side shock and that but you know in in recent decades the Great supply-side shock but that brought prices down was the end was globalization and in particular the entrance of China into the global trading system and its massive growth in export shares so you would normally have expected during this period when World Trader Goods prices were inexorably declining that the price level should be declining but yet nevertheless the central Bankers with their fixation on this two percent inflation Target and their fear of deflation but that what they feared was what Hayek would have called the good deflation that comes from Supply positive Supply shocks and Rising productivity so the central bank has acted against that declining price level and they and in the process doing so they brought the interest rates down very low and then you get what did you get you've got the succession of spec to Bubbles you what as I argue misallocation of capital you had a huge amount of risk-taking you had to build up of Leverage so and that in fact actually what's quite I mean not amusing it's sort of tragic is that buildup of Leverage prior to the global financial crisis which to my mind was induced in large measure by the Greenspan feds Easy Money policies at after the.com bubble that then creates genuine deflationary problems when when the cred when the banking credit bubble bursts so I I don't think one of my points in the book is I don't think this narrow inflation Target targeting to discover the natural rate of interest is actually useful I I say I I which I don't see but so I was talking to Economist friend of mine the other day and apparently there's a late medieval School of Economist called the school of Salamanca whose main protagonist says the real rate of interest is known only to God yeah I think that's probably true um but then um but then you see if it's not if the real rate if the natural rate of interest isn't revealed just by inflation or deflation then I think one I say in the book is you you know when you haven't got the natural rate of inflation in interest when you you know when the rate of interest wrong is that when you're getting these asset price bubbles all this excessive risk-taking or or this buildup of Leverage so these are there are other there are other indications that the interest rate has been set wrong and I could I mean at this stage I just introduce another idea which we haven't really discussed which is a point made by a Yale economic Financial historical Bill gatesman he he says interests most important uh the most important invention in the history of Finance because it allows transactions to take place across time now Hayek in the 1920s started to play around with this idea of what he called inter-temporal disequilibrium an inter tank this equilibrium is frankly when you're you know when there is an imbalance between the present your your present activities and your future required activities so if you have too much debt you have an inter-temporal in bats if asset prices are over inflated that's another form of inter-temporal imbalance because the the Returns on the assets when they're super inflated are not going to meet the requirements of investors who purchase those super inflated assets they're going to lose money so my argument is that I'm not expect to go back to the question of what the natural rate of interest is it may not be discoverable but it would be a rate at which there is an in an inter-temporal balance between current borrowing saving and investment and future consumption and I think I'm pretty I'm pretty pre-convinced that we that we have got our financial system and economies into a state of pretty acute inter-temporal disequilibrium so we are living in a place of course only God knows the natural interest rate and Jerome Powell is not God um of course I I don't even think he would he would think that um but uh we are living in a time of unnatural and unnatural rate of interest set by Central Bankers of the fixation on this two percent uh interest and it's causing this intemporal balance this kind of distortion of um the present uh and a uh dis equilibrium with the future and you're saying some of the symptoms of this are maybe I'm linking this to the earlier part of the conversation the the everything bubble what's interesting about the kind of the the everything bubble that that we're in right now is you look at phenomenons that have happened over the last couple of years like you look at cryptocurrency of course as shot up in price and and different kind of you know nfts and there's there's value there of course but it there's a lot of memetic value uh it seems to be caused by sort of of low interest rates you look at meme stocks that is another symptom of this you look at the asset prices everywhere that have completely swollen and I think there's a tendency of media or just kind of a gut reaction to blame The Madness of crowds as causing the bubble I was like this is another tulip Mania or something and you're saying it's it's more a symptom of this low interest rate environment yes speculative bubbles are inevitable but this one in particular at this point in time does it seem like it's fueled by this low interest environment this um this unnatural interest rate that we're living in can you link this up for us Edward um so as you know in the book I have a chart somewhere which shows U.S household net wealth which the data that the FED has been collecting since nineteen early 1950s and what we see over the last 25 years is quite clearly bubbles appearing in household net net wealth um you know coincident with the bubbles we've been living through so you see a little sort of hillock of a bubble with the dot com bubble and then I might you know a somewhat larger increase in in net wealth to GDP by 2007 coming down in 2008 and then you see this you know Everest of a bubble forming and peaking in 20 at the end of 2021. at which point U.S household wealth is roughly 100 points of G of U.S GDP greater than its long-term average and what's quite interesting is that I I didn't mention in in the book but I I did run the numbers with uh with an analyst a few years ago what we found is that in the old days the increase in household net wealth would actually coincide with with actual Savings in the U.S system and then it became completely divorced from savings and um so the bubble then uh appears to be growing and I show this in the chart that at each cycle of these three bubbles the FED funds rate has been lower and lower and lower so as the interest rate came down over the course of the cycle household wealth got Higher and Higher and that's you know that's all household wealth aggregated together now go to the everything bubble yeah there's obviously the there are other factors at play you know the all the um the autists and retards On The Wall Street bet subreddit and and you know then then you are familiar then yeah I was I was early on to that and then yeah and then they're rushing you know off to Robin Hood the Robin Hood ah um you know where where the you know where the where there's you know stock trades are gamified as as the uh Massachusetts Regulators complaint and um and then High turnover and then you get this and one of the themes if you remember from devil take the high most is that changes in Communications technology feed through perspective Bubbles and so that the the that one aspect of the of the um of the everything bubble would would really probably have occurred under a different monetary environment but you know one one of the things that you're probably aware that that every that Robin Hood offered its loyal long-term investing clientele was two percent margin loans or if you paid them you know if you were a premium customer paying them I don't know what sixty dollars a month or something you actually got free margin loans on Robin Hood so you could leather the hell out of the mean stocks that you were buying and and as you saw at the time uh U.S margin loans in aggregate were you know at a Peak High during the everything bubble there is a point I I make in the book and and you know pretty obvious anyone has done any finances that long dated assets sorry assets with uh whose returns are in the distant future you might call them growth stocks or whatever or obviously benefit more from the reduction in the discount rate than than stocks that have you know that have a shorter payback period so what we found and what we saw in the you know in the period running up into the everything bubble is that so-called value stocks short duration stocks uh Investments did relatively poorly and uh growth stocks and long duration Investments did well and then I argue that assets with no income at all did best of all yes they did and and so you could say as as people you know as some wag said in the 1920s that the market was discounting the future and the Hereafter and by the way so yesterday I was I read somewhere you remember the SPAC King chemath yes and yeah say yesterday have you seen have you seen his uh I read a comment by by Jay Murph where he says this is to prices he says the mathematical truth of higher interest rates is that it renders your company valueless that is sort of slightly giving the game away isn't it so the spank bubble uh you know of companies that basically under anything approaching a normal rate of interest were were valueless according to one of its you know most prominent expounders um you know something to behold and and as I as I say those those that you know those SPAC companies look very much like the the bubble companies that appeared in Britain during the south sea bubble of 1720 another period in which interest rates had been declining and you had this you know fraud you know semi-flaudulent um outright fraudulent companies uh floated or in the in the coffee houses of the city of London the most famous one being a company of what was it a company of great Advantage but no one to know what it what it is which is your almost a perfect definition for a SPAC a spat company learning about

financial Bubbles and also interest rates right and what one of the I think the special things about the price of time book is that if you really summarize like what is interest it's summarized in the title of the book you've done a fantastic job summarizing the entirety of of the price of time book into the title yeah do you want to say something on that yeah I mean look I mean obviously when one's writing but what has a spread one has a file open saying what the hell am I going to call this book so I didn't play around with the title uh for a while and there are um you know so many different definitions of what interest is but the important thing is as I said to to mention the the time Dimension and then to bear in mind that all our economic and financial activities take place over time necessarily and then if you think about it once you understand them the time has value nothing is as as Ben Franklin said time time is money once you realize that time has value then it should start becoming immediately clear that taking interest rates the price of time down to zero is highly unnatural it would be like depriving an animal of oxygen and taking them to negative becomes almost insane and what it does is a negative price of time actually starts moving the clock backwards and what we saw in at the peak of the everything bubble is that we had entered into a financial Wonderland in which the craziest things were happening I mean so one example of that is that as interest rates were falling ever and ever negative the bonds were delivering tremendously good returns because you get capital gains on the outstanding bonds as it rates fell negative and so people were actually thinking at a time when say 18 trillion dollars worth of Bonds were trading at negative yields that you bought bonds with negative yields for capital gains whereas you hold stocks for income I mean I I don't know there are so many different areas in which when one looks back on you know 2020 to 21. at the what was happening there was was quite surreal and and um and I think yes I think that this this zero negative rate of interest the lavishness with which the central banks uh borrowed and um I think roughly so globally eight or issued eight trillion dollars worth of uh of of reserves during that period to buy Securities that that I'm pretty sure is you know the the main uh mover of of these crazy markets yeah the articulation that when um interest rates go negative that part of the book where little just like you said people would buy equities for the revenues that the company would make the the value of the dividends and then people would buy bonds for the capital appreciation it's like well like you said the your the negative interest rates are making the clock go backwards and they're also making the role of bonds fill the role of equities and the role of equities fill the role of bonds like everything is just upside down I thought that was just like a great articulation of of the whole of the whole of the whole book I'm wondering if you could um do a similar uh unpacking of devil take the hindmost just as a title why is the book titled devil take the hindmost like why that title um so there is a theory of What's called the rational bubble if you come across the rational bubble Theory which was which is that it may it's rational to buy an asset provide even if it's overpriced if you can be assured that there will be a sucker to buy it off you at a higher price um I've never been in a particularly fan of the of the rational bubble Theory but um well the greater the greater fool Theory but what I've found you know reading the history of of financial speculation is that is that people who engaged in in the bubble in inspective activity had that sort of you know obviously this had that sort of mentality it's a you know if you will it's your pyramid scheme your Ponzi scheme mentality of I'll buy it and pass it off to someone else because I'm in an early stage of the pyramid scheme and what what um what one uh Speculator in um in the south sea bubble of 1720 the English types Republic 1720 says uh is when the rest of the world is mad we must imitate them in some measure and let the devil take the hindmost and the devil take that the devil take the hindmost is that yeah there's actually there's a legend Spanish legend that the devil would arrive I think in the uh Spanish city of Salamanca uh and and he would there would be a race of the of the young Priests of the Seminary and the idea is that the devil would take the priest the young priests the seminarian who who was slowest and you know that is there's clearly a an element of that in every spective bubble which is hey you know I'm sort of I'm smarter than suckers I've spotted this earlier the truth is you know obviously at some Level A specter bubble is a transfer of wealth between speculators and if you are in early and out early then you know the games worked for you Edward one thing that's that's clear to me both after reading both of your books is that we keep on we as a as a species as a society run through the same things over and over and over again and I think by the time I was when I was going through Double Take the hindmost I had gotten to the 1920s and I was already like face palming about like oh we're about to do this all over again and that was and that was the 1920s right we still had a number of financial bubbles ever since and so it's interesting to take the position of a historian and an author and a researcher when looking at these things and I'm wondering if you could just like I don't know audit the human species the human human society as like our ability to navigate these interest rates and speculative bubbles in financial markets how how much have we been able to learn from our ancestors and and lessons of old because it seems to me not much are we getting any better at this yeah we're getting any better I think we're I'm afraid to say I think we're getting actually a great deal worse um the the um first of all I mean it says it's platitude to say that human psychology doesn't change um and Jim Grant Financial journalist historian says um I think he says somewhere that in in um science engineering uh progress is linear whereas in finance it is cyclical we learn from our mistakes as a society and as individual individually so that's fair enough but why might things be getting worse which is from Magic um first of all I think that the technology brings larger amounts of players into these into these games if you want to call them that and so as you see as we mentioned earlier Robin Hood and and and and in China you know stock brokerages found in it with tens you know tens of millions of speculators uh playing the game um so I think the technology broadens things I think it makes it easier to create these uh information Cascades these little bubbles you know Twitter would seem to be a perfect place for forming bubbles they might be expected bubbles I mean my view is that it's a great extent the sort of the fears of the pandemic was a sort of fair bubble uh also generated by social media so I think that's you know that's one reason why problems might be getting worse um and then we've got the attitude of the authorities in principle if you're going to learn from your mistakes you should suffer some pain and loss but if the Authority's response to each one of societies Financial failures is to underwrite the losses and to encourage the re-emergence of the of the exactly the same type of behavior that got you into trouble in the first place whether it's speculating or over leveraging or whatever then you're not really going to learn from your mistakes in fact the will you may even have a situation in which the sort of evolution of the of the pla of the players speculating population will actually become will actually suffer from adverse selection and for instance you know in the you know the early part of the last decade I was working for uh this firm called GMA in Boston a sort of a value value driven um investment firm I was in the Quan in the asset allocation team oh we like to think of ourselves as not buying assets that were overvalued relative to their historic norms um and it was a very difficult environment as you can imagine in which to operate in you saw after 2009 with interest rates taken to zero in large months QE the markets came back very very quickly financial markets U.S market actually went to a high valuation relative to its historic norm and then continued compounding at 10 a year for a decade and by you know by the end of 2020 2021 by the end of the everything bubble the U.S stock market as you probably know was the highest valuation on any number of different value valuation measures but let's just stick with the sickly cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio sometimes called the Schiller be after Robert Schiller who collects the data at Yale and what you see is that that was the second highest valuation of the U.S stock market in in 2021 except for the just last last gasp of the.com bubble and and and yet it was very difficult for an investor not to be sucked into that bubble because by being sucked into that bubble you if you didn't get sucked into that bubble you would underperform and your clients would tear assets away which is why my old boss Jeremy Grantham at GMO says that the really he thinks the biggest driver of Mark is not particularly interested in my whole interest stuff he thinks the biggest driver of markets is what he calls career risk which is if you try and battle a bubble you will be sacked and and this is he often cites a comment of of of Keynes from the general theory where Cain says in in the world of professional investment it is better to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally and um so I think you said I'm just veering a tiny bit away from the original question but my point is that if we don't learn from our mistakes and if the authorities uh if you will reward us for making mistakes then obviously we will um our mistakes are going to get bigger and bigger so Edward as a result of just doing just deep research across like hundreds of years of examples of humans engaging in speculative behavior and financial operators turning into Financial manipulators uh you you do a great job writing your books maintaining a decent amount of like neutrality and objectivity and simply just telling the story but I'm wondering if if you just have developed your own personal opinions about like what makes good economics so in at least in the crypto world we have debates about Fiat money versus commodity money versus Commodities we have debates about Austrian economics versus Keynesian economics I'm wondering just like how have you landed in the world of economic debate um so the crypto words um I take it is um it's quite sympathetic to Hayek's idea the denationalization of money and my book has quite a lot of hike in it um I mentioned earlier the the um Hayek's comments on on whether you know on targeting on on on on targeting monetary policy on on movements in the price level and then towards the end of the book I I sort of discuss High X notion of the road to serfdom and what I argue is that if interest rates are constantly manipulated by the authorities they will weaken the economic system their weaken economic growth and they will require the central bank to play a larger and larger role in the allocation of capital and that we were we appear to be moving in the in recent years into what you might call a period of central Banker capitalism in which the central banks were the main determinants of what was going on both in the financial world but also in the real economy and this was a a creeping process which would then undermine a capitalist system based on free enterprise and individualism um so so I think that Hayek is you know is a a major influence on that book if you want to know one difference between devil take the high mist and this new book is when I wrote devotee the highness I hadn't actually read Hayek which is sort of probably pretty standard for most um most economists nowadays they haven't read Hayek either and then I got into Hayek um just over sort of 20 years ago when I started you know roughly 20 years ago when I started sort of looking at the credit bubble that was forming in 2003 and wondered and then started you know that's when I started reading a bit of Hayek um and again this book has recently been been awarded the 2023 Hayek prize so that was you know wow very very gratifying for me hi the morning I received the prize I was reading my wife extracts of the price of the re of of the road surfton saying darling this is irrelevant to today it's definitely a um an influence and I didn't if you did you pick up uh in the last paragraph of the post script and I'm we I think this might be interesting place to take to to move the conversation I discussed the idea of whether a cryptocurrency or a central bank digital currency might replace the Fiat currencies of the of the current world of the Fiat currencies and the and the bank created if you will fountain pen money and by having a uh a currency that was truly Limited in Supply we would then get back to discovering what was the natural rate of interest or market rate of interest and if we were able to make that transition we would then um we would then once we had a a market rate of interest that was closer to people's time preferences for want to ever work better word then we we would have less buildup of debt less specular Bubbles and and Sounder financial markets and probably stronger economic growth so that I mean I didn't I didn't elaborate at that point in great detail but that was my sort of parting shot elaborate a little bit more so that's very interesting yes you are right the crypto Community is a very very uh big fans of Hayek um It quotes him often uh so so how do you see crypto at this place in time it sounds like maybe what you're alluding to is we have this Bank created fountain pen money uh you know money printer go Burr is what you know we we in crypto say and it's leading to unnatural interest rates and are you saying Edward that you see crypto this non-state non-central Bank controlled monetary unit you do you see that as kind of a check on power a way to maybe restore balance and get us closer to something that looks like a natural interest rate um possibly is my answer I'm you know I I don't I don't profess snow as much about the crypto world as you do uh but my my um intuition uh when I was finishing the book in in late 21 was that there was um you know a lot of um skydaggery in the crypto world and there were a lot of um you know what appeared to be sort of Ponzi schemes operating in the crypto world and that seems to have been you know somewhat borne out by the you know crypto winter uh ensuing last year and the um you know the failure of of of Sam bankman Freed's miscellaneous activities I heard about that one did you yeah I did I actually rated piece I was one I I wrote a piece in which I said that I I thought that actually that that SBF wasn't actually conducting a fraud but a spoof because if you look at his interviews he actually seems to be telling his interviewers and the public that hey that this whole thing is really corrupt you can't really value anything and then of course you know that that famous uh advertisement with Larry David was just saying you know hey this doesn't work well actually it didn't work so yeah um so that's in my my thought was that probably as things stood at the early stages and and perhaps it's not early stage any longer but of crypto is that it was it didn't really have the um you know didn't really have the werewithal become an alternative uh currency or money and I think in particular as you you know there you know there are some one definition of money is as a social network so fair enough you can have I mean its own number of different things have been money historically I think I've got an excellent book by someone called I think it's called Paul Einstein if you've seen it called primitive money so you've seen that which is a great book which you must read if you're interested in money because he just lists all the various primitive monies and including I think rat traps or a form of currency in one right in traps rat traps anyhow so but the thing is that for it for money to be accepted it not it mustn't be only accepted by by you know a community of users but also has to perform the sort of State money function and what we clearly know is that the the ma the the monetary the governments are not going to give up their Monopoly on legal tender without you know a bitter fight um I I read a piece last week uh for calling my right for Reuters breaking views which was based on a conversation I have with a um a friend of mine who called Thomas Meyer who's who's a uh a German Economist used to be Chief Economist of Deutsche Bank but Thomas is a is a a very um Keen uh Austrian Economist but and although the Austrian Hayek is associated with the private money uh Thomas has this idea that a central bank digital currency if it was if it was issued to increase at a certain rate the sort of protocol to increase at a certain rate in line with your average nominal GDP growth or whatever over a certain period of time uh that if that cbdc were to replace Bank deposits so that Banks were no longer in the business of creating money and that Banks would no longer be subject to bank runs then you could have a sort of I think what I call a a digital Chicago plan or digital narrow banking now Thomas says you know when I was talking to him he said a couple of things about his this you know Thomas's digital um digital Chicago banking first of all he said it wouldn't necessitate getting rid of paper currency so that fear and I think quite legitimate fear that if you issued a cbdc the central bank would be tracking every one of your actions and I mentioned that in the book you know the cbdc is a digital panopticon that could be um somewhat abated and Thomas also says that in his world you could have your your your cbdc and your narrow banking but you would there would also be rum for competing crypto currencies to operate say would I mean Thomas is really suggesting a way in which you could harmonize the you know hayekian's denationalization of money idea with if you will the sort of State theory of money idea uh of what's called George Knapp um and yeah it's it's an idea I mean what I think is quite interesting about it as you know the the central banks now sitting on masses of bonds as a result of their QE and they don't know what to do with them and those bonds are on a mark to Market basis uh starting to produce losses um but the banks are also sitting on massive reserves with the central banks now if you want to introduce say a central bank digital currency um along Thomas's line and this is very much along the lines of the Chicago plan mooted in the 1930s by the likes of well of Irving Fisher and um Chicago economists like Frank Knight what you need to do is the central the banks need to surrender their bonds to the central bank to be issued with reserves that then become your narrow banking so we're sort of you know believe it or not and it is quite weird we're sort of halfway there with or even three quarters of the way there without anyone planning and one of the then another really interesting thing which I hadn't really understood about the original Chicago plan and I've actually got you on my desk I've hit I've got um Irving Fisher's book 100 I read it's actually worth reading you the uh the full I don't know if you come across this book this is Irving Fisher's 100 money which is his Chicago plan it says 100 money designed to keep checking Banks 100 liquid to prevent inflation and deflation largely to cure or prevent depressions and wait for it to wipe out much of the national debt and the reason you wipe out much much of the national debt is that when you issue and you probably I mean tell me if you're familiar with all of this but when you issue when you move over to the Chicago plan the Central Bank soaks up all the government bonds and issues its new state-back money but the state back money doesn't actually pay interest and so because it doesn't pay interest there is a one-off enormous senior Ridge gained for the currency issuer and that um according to Thomas Meyer that would amount in Europe to roughly within the Eurozone to roughly half of the outstanding European government debts it would wipe out 6 trillion dollars of government debt and I'm going to get the numbers slightly wrong but I think that sort of Holdings of the ECB are roughly I'm going to say roughly three trillion as I say you're you're halfway there towards making the conversion so I I and I I don't know what your views on on on 100 money are or on um on bringing an end fractional Reserve banking but what it occurs to me is that anyone who thought about the problems of Finance for long enough eventually comes to the conclusion just you know we cannot have fractional Reserve banking you're running a muck and destabilizing the financial system time and time again and what's interesting to me when I start reading about the Chicago plan is you find economists of very different Persuasions you know the uh you know Keynesian economists like James Tobin Noble Laureate or or I mean it managed his economists like like Milton Friedman coming to the coming round to the same plan so you're potentially that you know that solution as for this as for the um as for the cryptos the way I see it is this is that if we have a badly designed Central Bank digital currency and the chances that we probably will too and if embedded in that badly designed digital currency is a either an inflationary tendency or a um 10 or the sort of digital panoptican aspect in which all our actions are being are being followed then I think that one type of cryptocurrency will then establish itself for a lot of transactions that transactions that people don't wish to have surveilled by the state and I'm not saying looking at that just necessary sort of you know drug running and terrorism but just you know the people you know people are I think are happier you you tell me but I think people are happier you know frankly that these are all MasterCard should see their credit cards transactions then that an arm of the state should actually be able to create a profile of everything you're doing perhaps anyhow the NSA is already creating such prefer but the that they don't really want to see the state engaged in that and and as I say go back to Hayek you know somewhere who says the invention of money is the most powerful instrument for Freedom ever created and and I think that the sort of the Chinese digital currency Central band digital currency plans the the digital Yuan or whatever you want to call it that I think is the strongest um totalitarian instrument that has ever been conceived and when you bring it together with um you know XI jinping's what's it called you know the um the credit credit system for rewarding good behavior and bad punishing bad behavior social credit if you put merge it with social credit then you actually have a much stronger as you this you're familiar with all of this but you have a much stronger control of your population than uh then was really an offer in the No No communist or fascist Society in the past would ever have been able to control people so so um you know with with such a strong uh rod um so yeah I I think you know I think going down that route there is a uh you know a a crypto future and then you know as no doubt as as the crypto folks all been saying since run on Silicon Valley Bank is the yeah the run of the Silicon Valley bags not just showing the sort of instability of the banking system but it is also shows the Central Bank fed and the and and and the federal government through the pension benefit guarantee Corporation taking on more and more responsibility uh writing you know underwriting loans underwriting deposits and and when that has taken too far you move closer to a collapse in the monetary system and it's at that time that then yeah frankly uh Alternatives stores of value become attractive it's what you had um during the German hyperinflation that there was something they called um fluke it's quite a good phrase flux in the sack verton which means flight into things a real value now you know I think then you just have to conceive what real value is and perhaps because I'm a bit older than you guys you know I I have a bit of sort of the gold bug about me and um it's coming back Edward yeah yeah so I have you know my friend Felix Martin who's a fella sort of financial story right he refers to gold as man's oldest bubble and I'm quite attracted to man's oldest bubble um and and yeah and that that's one way and and as I say a well-designed crypto would be a an alternative Edward it's been an absolute pleasure um to have you on the show and for for giving us so much information for for giving us your knowledge I I guess a couple of comments on what you just said this idea I think I think you are one of us uh in in some core ideas this idea that money is a freedom technology that's a hayekian uh idea it's also a deeply embedded crypto idea and this idea that we are converging towards a central bank digital currency and so um you know maybe the end of this decade maybe a little bit longer maybe sooner there will be two forms of digital money there'll be a central bank digital money which is not as free it's kind of the pr the crypto prediction and uh an alternative money that is free which is which is crypto I I would love the idea of a digital Chicago Bank to come to fruition that that protected um citizen rights that uh didn't give away our privacy that didn't have an you know inflation as a senior Edge uh fee attached to it I just with the central Banker capitalism that you've rightly identified it's hard to imagine that that world exists but we'll be pushing for that as well anyway there's so much more we could we could talk to you about and I feel like as this progresses this is one of the most interesting times um I think in monetary history at least in in recent times I don't know if it's the most interesting in your decade but like we're we're in in your lifetime but we're really seeing uh new things come arise uh this in like in years I mean and so I feel like we should have you back on again to talk us through that but I want to end with this last question do you have any predictions on what's going to happen next just general predictions given what you've seen across time with other societies and other civilizations in the place we are now as David said earlier when he was reading devil take the high most and you guys in the 1920s he smacked his head and I because we're going to do it again and I feel like now is the 2020s and I feel like this is a head-smacking moment I feel like we're about to do something again what do you think that thing is um so well perhaps we are in the late 20s um but the we've we've gone beyond 29 I mean if we were the 20s then we're in 1930 um I what I think is this and and just just stick to the sort of the main thrust of of the book the new book the price of time is that a huge the the entire Financial system and the economy itself became adapted to these extraordinary low interest rates and that as that begins to change with inflation coming into the system and interest rates Rising then uh the House of Cards begins to collapse and so far you know we've seen you know big crash in in the UK guilts market and the near bankruptcy of of the UK Pension funds we saw you know the crypto winter that we've mentioned and then the Regional Bank banking crisis kicked off with the uh collapse of Silicon Valley bank now my in my strong thought is that this has further to go that we're not you know that we're not at the end of the process it's not you know in baseball in baseball terms we're not in the ninth Innings we're not in I don't think we're in the eighth Innings and um so the the I think that the are you know going to be very long prolonged and difficult period of transitioning out of where of this of this ultra low interest rate environment and go back just finally to that point I made about U.S household wealth you know I looked at the data from uh recently published by the fed and it really has hardly come down a lot it hasn't really come down very much from its highest level in in 20 2021 so I think there is going to be a uh a large evaporation should we call it not destruction there can be a large evaporation of wealth I think that a lot of that evaporation wealth will come from nominal assets paper wealth in the claims fixed income securities and the like over the recent year over the following years as we get this financial repression so that I think you know it's going to be a challenge for investors to retain their wealth um but you know it's not impossible that people who position themselves prudently uh shouldn't you know more or less retain their purchasing power Edward uh what a great way to close thank you so much for uh joining us on on Bank list today my pleasure bankless listener I reminded of that quote as we close those who forget their history are condemned to repeat it I almost feel like even those who remember their history are also condemned to repeat it it feels like we're going through the cycle one more time and of course uh we'll be with you in this cycle this new monetary experiment that's being run both in crypto and in the world of Fiat some action items to you for you today the first is go pick up the book the price of time there's a link in the show notes absolutely fantastic book um also devil take the hindmost was one of our formative books in kind of learning about speculative bubbles these things apply directly to crypto all right so very important historical lesson yield and Bubbles yes that's what this that's what this whole thing is uh we also got have some links to primitive money uh the digital Chicago plan which was the column in the Irving Fisher book 100 money some of these I have not taken a look at so I plan to go do my homework after this episode gotta end with this of course none of this has been Financial advice Fiat economies interest Finance markets it's all risky so is crypto you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot foreign
