when I'm looking for a spot to surf on any given day I'm always looking for the best spot that has the fewest number of people because I'm not going out there to compete with other people I'm going out there to ride a wave we're not so much in competition with other funds we want to be intellectually drawn to certain projects and we want to ride that wave and we're not so much distracted to a wave that has hundreds of thousands of people on it it's more like oh that's a really nice looking wave and there's actually not that many people over there I should probably go ride that way
