welcome to bankless when we explore the frontier of Internet money and the internet finance and sometimes that Frontier of Internet money is found at a conference which is why last weekend I flew out to Tel Aviv Israel to attend the star prayer sessions a two-day event hosted by startware to bring the greater stockware and Stark net ecosystem together to meet learn discuss and build the future of starknet and as you might be able to tell I have totally lost my voice from doing all of these interviews that I've brought back to share with you all here in the bankless nation I personally wanted to go to the stockware sessions because my understanding and comprehension of this darkwear ecosystem is not as strong as my understandings of other parts of the ethereum ecosystem and this makes sense when you learn about the design choices that starkware has made they've built their own developer language and their own virtual machine instead of using solidity and the evm like most other layer twos and other alt layer ones out there why do they do this what benefits does that bring how much friction does that make for developers how do starknet developers feel about the protocol they're building on how much ownership does this darknet community feel about the platform that they're all creating together these questions and many more are the questions that I saw answers for during my short time in Tel Aviv and why I wanted to go to Stark rare sessions in the first place and I certainly feel like I've got these questions answered but instead of just telling you what my conclusions are instead I'm bringing back nine interviews I did with various stakeholders and Builders of the starknet ecosystem so you can conclude for yourself what you think about what's being built over on the frontier of Stark world I interviewed URI kolodny and Ellie ban sassen the founders of starkware and who I'm warmly calling the dads as darknet and ask him about their perspectives of the network that they have spawned here and by Network I don't just mean protocol I also mean Community both URI and Ellie understand that what they've built has become much more than just a technology it's also become a movement which has been exemplified by the community that has come to surround them I also interviewed a governance Steward who's a member of the starkware foundation but who's more part of the starknet community than the stockware team and I asked him about how he thinks the future of starknet community ownership will play out I did two interviews about smart contract wallets and account abstraction Modi from braavos and yoab from the EF so you'll learn about the frontier of smart contract wallets in these interviews as well I also interviewed the sismo team who's building an identity and privacy system using zero knowledge proofs I talked to cartridge a platform that's building the building blocks that all starknet game developers will need there's also Herodotus who's building out what's called storage proofs which opened up my brain to a world of possibilities I didn't think possible I interviewed only dust which if you're a developer looking to get started making money developing on starknet definitely listen to that interview I talked to this darknet ID team starknet's native identity system and also interviewed ignoyama who's building out ZK proof chips to ensure that individuals can run ZK proofs themselves at home much like the same ethos of ethereum's taking I hope you enjoy all of these interviews at banklist we try and bring the frontier of crypto to you in a fun and digestible content format and I hope that's what I've done here none of these interviews are longer than 20 minutes so for those of you that can't keep up with the fire hose of bankless content maybe these shorter interviews are just a little more digestible and of course if you have specific questions about my experiences at this Hardware sessions or about any of the interviews that you're about to listen to hop into my q a channel inside of the bankless nation Discord this channel is dedicated to asking me directly any questions that you may have about any of the content that you hear on bankless so if you're a premium subscriber make sure you're in the Discord so you can have access to that channel if you've got a question that you want to ask feel free to drop it in my channel because I basically live in there these days so without further Ado let's get into my interviews from the stockware session starting with URI kolodny and Ellie Ben sassen the founders of stockware or what I'm calling the Stark dads but first a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make all of these interviews possible Kraken has been around for almost as long as crypto itself as crazy as crypto is Kraken has remained a rock for its clients building out a platform designed to stand the test of time Kraken is all about proof not promises which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves A system that lets kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange and for this reason and many more we've chosen Kraken as bankus's strategic sponsor for 2023 and once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty Fiat money into pristine crypto assets perhaps you should check out arbitrum where so much of the frontier of crypto Innovation is taking place arbitrim just announced their stylist initiative which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like rust C C plus plus alongside regular old solidity evm apps that's going to use any coding language they like and it simultaneously drops layer 2 feeds by an order of magnitude it's a big deal so many of your favorite D5 apps have already deployed to arbitrum like uniswap but did you know that uniswap isn't just for erc20 tokens anymore uniswap is also an nft aggregator too to make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFC purchases uniswap gives nft collectors and Traders powerful tools all from the Cozy comfy uniswap interface by the way it's also got a native Fiat on-ramp it's also deployed on like every Layer Two and it's got this Nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades crypto protocol calls like arbitrum and unit swap are becoming super powerful so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out if you're looking to upgrade your wall experience check out Phantom the number one wall of Solana which has recently come to both ethereum and polygon Phantom has native nft support giving you your own nft gallery from inside the wallet Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to spam both the Solana and ethereum ecosystems check it out at phantom.app and now let's get into the interview alright URI and Ellie of starkware the founders of starkware the first question I want to ask you guys is uh I mean you guys are big into math big into all of this stuff that really makes blockchains up and run but the first thing I noticed while we're here at Star Square sessions is that this is um this kind of starts to feel like its own network state to use biology's words like there is a community of people here that feel empowered and have agency over building the system of starknet so my first question you guys is is this what you guys expected when you first started along this journey long long time ago uh I for one had no understanding or expectations in this regard my my sort of initial impetus you know coming into this was uh actually around verifiable computation and as someone who actually required Ellie alluded to this on say it took me years to sort of appreciate the value of that I still see tremendous value of that but uh this whole social dimension of of starkness uh I would not have known to dream up something so as beautiful as as we have here it's just we're very fortunate to you know to have it my answer would be yes and no yes in the sense that um it was always clear to us that this is a transformational technology that will you know conquer the world we didn't know and we still don't know whether starkware will be you know able to best monetize it maybe someone that comes later on or whether we're going exactly down the right route and so it was very clear to us from the start that this is you know going to conquer the world now no in the sense that the particulars of the how it like is evolving is like it's it's so hard to predict I don't know for us like any of this but it's so much fun and it's so uplifting to see this Independence like this which also comes with like this losing control over this thing this is like it's like a child it's way bigger than than than what we could conceive of the when I first got into Tel Aviv I immediately went over to the hacker house to see what all the hackers were building and the first thing that happened was a governance Workshop where two members of the starknet foundation uh sat everyone down sat down on the ground like crisscross like crisscross their legs and we're they and answered questions about governance uh but it really seems to be in the early days of Stark net governance as there isn't really like people are learning how to govern not really there's no governance roadmap and it's something that really the community has to come together to determine how are you guys seeing these conversations progress both from from the starkware side of things and how are how are the developers of starknet like Auto organizing themselves I would like to say that I know enough and am in some sort aware or on top of some of these things but the Frank answer is no I I I don't have enough uh like time and um presence of mind to uh even learn and follow all that's going but I have a very deep trust and conviction in um you know I believe this community will transcend um the way like governance is done today on blockchain because there's much to hope for and I have good feelings about it but I'm not I mean the uh I'm not fully up to speed on this stuff but the last at last count I knew of I think 93 delegates uh for you know for for Stark net people presenting themselves as as delegates and that's an amazing number in my opinion for something so nascent um and I probably don't know you know the vast majority of them which is wonderful um so you know I think it's off to a promising start there's a ton of work ahead and a ton of experimentation and invention in this Regard in this Dimension I'm sure there are a bunch of ideas in the ecosystem that we can build on and learn from and and probably maybe you know variations on various themes um and we look forward to that I think that's exciting work and uh I was watching your guys's uh opening statements this morning and your opening talk about how we got here in the world of starks and and all of this uh crazy math which breaks my brain and it's very clear that both of you have a very strong understanding of math and cryptography and some of the deep underlying Technologies but no one has an understanding as governance like it's almost an impossible thing to understand and I actually kind of think that's perhaps to the best for starknet as in if you guys had a grasp on governance as you did on math it would be a little bit more top down when it needs to be a little bit more chaotic and bottom up uh do you guys have any any thoughts about that I I want to say that um okay blockchain is relatively new and because of that blockchain governance is still fumbling around a little bit but the nice thing is that humans have been dabbling with governance for you know since ever and there are things like you know corporations there are democracies there are open source projects that are very inspiring and amazing so I hope that the starknet governance takes a little bit from these um well-established and successful models you know things that resemble corporate governance open source projects uh democracy various Source representative democracies and things like that and then of course um imbuing it uh the whatever is new in in blockchain which tool does operate differently but there is there are precedents to take from and be inspired by and I hope I hope whoever's doing the governance will will take that the the thing that I find most interesting and most challenging um also most menacing in real life in the context of democracies is finding this balance between in a democratic sense giving everyone a voice yet allowing experts to have their proper say and the ability to to control all sorts of of very fine sort of human interactions from sort of falling off the cliff and I think thinking about current Israeli the politics and and I and I think that um finding that balance is is is a huge challenge in maintaining that balance as we see is made perhaps an even bigger challenge so yeah a lot of work ahead of us uh how many people have come out to the software session so you guys have those numbers I don't know exactly uh because there are multiple events Etc but I think somewhere between 800 and 1000 people uh for a bunch of different events uh uh some of us uh well organized by a whole bunch of uh what coalesced around this is this eth Tel Aviv uh thingo uh with uh fire blocks and a bunch of other companies and we're happy very happy to sort of see this whole thing this whole week sort of come to life and by the way I don't know if when this is going to come out but but if anyone has a chance to go to The Hacker House that's complete Insanity just just the the the energy is the air is is uh there's electricity in the air I really urge you to go there so if uh 800 to a thousand ish people came out I'm gonna guess 80 to 90 percent of them are very technically minded and that is um probably what every single developer ecosystem looks for to generate inside of their own like that's a success metric so first off congratulations on all this success what did Stark wear and what has starknet done well that produced that outcome what what are your guys's strengths that allowed so many people to come out all the way out to Tel Aviv to attend this conference um well I think two things in terms of tooling I think the emphasis on saying yes there's something very appealing and very exciting about the math but at the end of the day we're here to serve developers and we need to offer them the tools that make them happy and Cairo 1.0 is right around the corner and that's a huge draw for a lot of this crowd I think that's one thing the other thing I think is is actually not technical is social there's some something uh authentic that people feel and they're drawn to and then there's a virtual cycle around that authenticity and and I'm very happy it's it's uh sort of uh unfolding this way I'll answer that's it um starkware and its technology are we keep saying this all the time we're not about hype but we really you know it's the real thing and developers recognize that what do I mean it's the real thing we actually ship the things we say we're gonna ship and they actually work very well from the point of view of developers and they are you know they exist there they're not just tweets they're not just you know test Nets that take forever to get to the next stage these are working things and developers sense that and at the same time it's very new but I think developers they also sense that this is a technology that really can really really scale uh through fractal scaling and layer threes and recursion and there's a lot of room for expansion so they they want to be part of that one of the things I'm noticing is that there's starting to be some stratification in this darkwear ecosystem uh and I'm not technically minded so I'm doing my best to understand how this goes but there seems to be people who are really interested in the protocol design of starknet and all of the associated things about that sequencing like a blockchain all that kind of stuff and then there's app developers and Cairo on top of those and those seem to be the two main camps of people that have Auto organized uh are there any are there any other camps that I'm missing in the software ecosystem and how do you see this playing forward into the future um I think that around layer three there's sort of a community forming I think that around the whole programming languages dimension of it of Cairo 1.0 there is uh like a sub Community forming um yeah and the the the nice thing to see is how these things sort of they coalesce of of their own uh Accord to the DAP developers which are usually small projects in the infrastructure developers I would add the businesses so you know Visa's use of Stark net for account abstraction is an example of like an Enterprise as big as it gets that is looking into this they're not the only ones there are a lot of they're multiple you know Banks who have sent here their you know Innovation teams to look at what's going on so that's like a third category that is you know inquisitive about this technology yeah there was a conversation yesterday between uh the blockchain lead for uh a big credit card company that I will uh leave unnamed and uh and uh Terence of cartridge about you know the work there they've been doing around account extraction you know and I told them that cartridge is closing the Gap with the you know building on starkman Etc but the gap between blockchain technology and stuff that that our parents can use and uh and that's a big deal I was talking to uh the BD guy over at starkware starknet uh about the the Visa use of starknet for account abstraction he was joking about how he didn't of all the BD that starkman Ware has done Visa chose starknet of their own accord uh what was the conversations like when you guys heard that news uh from the software team so um maybe this goes to this point around authenticity right that you can sort of force your way into sort of uh press releases and literally Buy uh sort of uh the the interaction and and pulling people onto your ecosystem or something can happen in a more uh sort of authentic and organic fashion and when it does it may take slower you know it's low it's it's it's lower it's it's uh it's harder but when it happens there's something more uh sort of stable about it it's a it's a solid foundation to build on so the the application layer on top of Stark net starting to really come alive and there are some categories that I'm starting to see play out there's uh just of course the the world of account abstraction but that's just a means to an end for you know more usage right so the gaming ecosystem on Star Stark net starting to become pretty alive um what are what are some use cases that you guys are saying that perhaps intrinsically interests you like what's your favorite use case on on the Stark net ecosystem right now I I would I don't know if it's going to be the one that is like you know the killer app the crypto kitties if you will of starking it but it's one I would really like to see pushed more it's the whole social network and proof of identity and bringing the humans you know through reputation credit scores uh you know I own my data because I think really if the end but so you know we started with proof of work then there's proof of stake but if you think about it the really the end point you want is you want like one person one vote as as an infrastructure layer of blockchains and even we need to head in that direction so it's going to take a while and we want to do so in a decentralized way right without governments and you know kyc things um but anything that has to do with like you are the master and owner of your information and your history and you attest to your credit and worthiness I would love to see those things that's my favorite I I share this sentiment I around things supporting sort of broad reach social interaction and and the coordination meaningful problems that have yet to be solved in the real world I think uh I I'm eager to see that play out so if we were to go back to 2013 2015 when like the early starkware um just foundations were set I kind of wouldn't I would always ask my my guest a similar question if the road map for for stockware starknet was maximally successful what would it look like I kind of imagine this might actually be what it what would that answer look like back in 2013 2015 where you have a thousand devs coming all the way to Tel Aviv to take part in these conversations but let's extend that forward so we're in 2023 now what does the maximally successful road map for starknet look like if we go into 2028 um you know the problem with me is is I lack imagination in a very sort of extreme way so I I the only thing I can do is sort of take some recent activity and sort of multiply that so like this Darkness CC events which are Community organized there have been two about 500 participants in each one in 2028 I suspect they're going to be many of these all over the world they're going to be sort of like open sourced and in the sense that that uh the only does team and no Guardian teams that organized this I think are gonna sort of open it up to other community members to organize these events and I expect we're going to see these as sort of coordination and networking events all over the world and as Ellie said on stage this morning the the the face-to-face interaction uh there's something very very powerful about it in terms of enhancing uh interactions so I I expect we're going to see that in a massive way My Hope for 2028 is okay like number wise I have no doubt that this number thousand now in 2028 is 10 000 or more uh you can you know quote me on that and like I will talk in 2028 hopefully so let's see where we are um so number wise I have no doubt that this is gonna like really really uh explode uh which is good but at the end of the day blockchain is a technology that enables social functions social goods so I would really love to see um starknet blossoming into this layer that is dominated not by the developers but by people who are socially active and socially aware and want to take it a step further for the betterment of society right so like again things like voting systems reaching consensus on stuff that really matters human rights or that's what I'd like to see in 2028 now maybe 2028 is a bit too soon for that but I think that's where really where it really should be heading well of course uh everything about crypto is always early uh so maybe the conversations start in 2028 and then in 2038 uh that's when it actually happens probably uh so uh as as all ecosystems that sort to grow into themselves uh the original parents of them probably get confused by some of this weird stuff that's going on because that's just what they do the the bird has started to leave the nest and that's definitely what we're seeing here so what are you two focus on on a day-to-day basis what's a day in the life of urianelli um well my okay there's before uh Uli uh dropped off the map and there's after so after is very clear to me I'm just like you know how do you say like trading try to keeping my head above the water and like uh dealing with stuff uh I used to have a bit more time to properly try to think about certain things and get involved in like uh the material like thinking about governance or you know tokenomics or uh uh so when he comes back which is going to be soon uh I'll do a bit more of that but now it's just uh yeah so I'm I'm uh I'm on a medical leave of absence I hope to be back soon um before that I was sort of uh well a bunch of things uh sort of making sure trains run on time in a broad sense and doing my best to attract talented people to join starkware in the ecosystem and um in in a fair bit of just making sure information flows meaning someone talks to you and you say ah you should talk to X about that do you know that they're also working on something like this and so a fair bit of that just sort of as a router of information in the company and in the ecosystem URI loves this quote 90 of life is just showing up so I think that's just you know connecting things pushing something like this sort of very prosaic non how do you say it non-like uh not terribly glamorous yeah just yeah but like that's 90 of uh what goes on in life and uh just for the added context or you you opened up the the software sessions which uh you you both of course the two Founders on stage to to talk about like oh There Was An Unexpected medical emergency that I've had to attend to to which is not to say that the founder has dropped off as like no this is a uh something else uh but what was your reaction to the uh like moments like this trigger reflection and Trigger like learnings and all of a sudden you're able to look at the starkware Stark net ecosystem from a different perspective what was your learnings in those moments as you had to step away as you were viewing starknet from a more of a distance the decision to go on a leave of absence was reached within minutes because frankly it's it wasn't only an emotional need it was a very very practical need for my family um I'm insanely fortunate in the sense that starkware is made up of uh just a a crazy number of talented and capable people and and we've succeeded in building a culture where uh the system the human system can absorb this kind of shock in a very trivial fashion and you know often in startup land you say you know Ellie was referring you know what happens if you get hit by a bus this was for me as close as it ever got to a bus and the organization just uh operated in the smoothest of Fashions and and you know looking back sort of uh 20 some years of Entrepreneurship this is probably the one thing I I'm most proud of that it was put to this stress test and it's passed in flying colors and uh and it may sound ironic why are you so proud of the fact that you know this ship can continue without you without even blinking and I don't know the answer to that is I don't know why but it's just I'm I'm bursting with Prime well it's very cool you guys have certainly built a very alive ecosystem which is the the one key success indicator that we look for in this space um as I watch you two uh open up this uh the the conference uh I was just struck by how you guys just seem like age-old college roommates you guys have been I don't know working with each other for decades now uh and you guys even look like each other at this point yeah what's what's that been like having a second half to throughout all this so yeah we we're it's a little disturbing the number of people who say that we look alike um yeah we we've known one another for many many many years it has made a remarkable number of situations it's turned them from challenging to trivial on the business front on personal stuff on every dimension of of this story uh we've worked very closely over the past five years we've been friends for many years but we haven't worked this closely I guess since the late 80s so I'll add to that that um so first of all um well you know now that he's on leave of absence so like you know when we're together first of all we fight in bicker a lot and um on like a whole bunch of things professionally you know ego things on like you know matters of style um but I know what I'm saying is also true for for UGI like I have the utmost respect for him as you know as a professional and as a smart person and knowledge is important than that just like and I said this for him from day one and I'll say it I'm sure to the rest of my life as I am sure that the sun will rise tomorrow I know that I can trust him at a very deep level like you know we fight we argue there's a lot of things we disagree about but like at a very fundamental level you know our technology is about integrity but in humans you cannot replace Integrity with any kind of math so you need to have this like relationship of trust and just at a very deep level he's worthy of trust I yeah I I can I can only uh it's it's really funny how how in this trustless universe at the end of the day in order to to do what we're doing it's based on very deep human trust but there's an abundance of that here well Ellie early uh you guys I think exude some of the principles the Deep first principles thinking that really is important in this space and I'm glad that there's two of you to to carry this ecosystem forward and so thank you for everything you're doing thank you thank you for coming out cheers thanks foreign [Music]
