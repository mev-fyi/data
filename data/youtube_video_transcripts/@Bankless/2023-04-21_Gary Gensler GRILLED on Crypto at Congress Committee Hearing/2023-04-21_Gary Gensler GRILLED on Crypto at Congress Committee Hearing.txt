the grilling of Gary Gensler that's what happened in front of Congress this week Bank was Nation April welcome to what David uh the bank this Friday weekly roll-up where we covered the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless no matter which regulator stands in our way here on the Friday week let's weekly roll up this week we know who it is uh Gary Gensler became the main character this week all right and he's been doing that ever since the beginning of the year we're going to talk about the Gary Gensler Grill sesh in front of Congress that happened we got a bunch of Clips it's really like a Gary versus the people type thing isn't it the people yeah so if you want to get your catharsis on we got some clips for you yes people people just like yelling at Gary Gensler and Gary has taken it it is cathartic but it's also like it was so frustrating we'll see what you guys think when we get to that section David what else are we talking about today ethereum chappella one week later we will look at all the stats and the metrics as to uh the withdrawals how many people withdrew their ether from the beacon train how many people the posited is either going is security going to zero we're going to talk all about that as well as some other big announcements and releases of this week uh an ethereum Layer Two gets its first second client so that's pretty cool rocket pool uh gets the biggest protocol upgrade of any LSD protocol ever in existence so we'll talk about the details about that thousands of wallets get their ether drained and no one really knows why which is concerning and I have stuck my head in the sand on that one uh all this and more so make sure you like And subscribe if you are listening to this on Apple podcast go and rate and review so we can get bankless to the top of the iTunes charts if you're on YouTube hit that subscribe button and the like button and overall uh do things that help us like And subscribe yeah bring us up the charts I mean crypto needs it right now right I don't know yeah are we in a bear Market are we in a bull market I don't know we're in this midpoint we're in this in between phase I'm not really sure what to call that we'll talk about that when we get to the markets before we get into the markets though we gotta tell tell you about our friends and sponsors over at safe formerly called gnosis safe this is a multi-sig of multi-cigs it is the multi-sig that everybody in crypto uses secures many billions of dollars on ethereum bankless uses it this is all our multi-sig of choice it's a bankless wallet okay there's no Bank in between it you've also heard us talking about account abstraction this is the future of wallets this gives ethereum wallets that fintech like experience with very smooth user interface so we've got the safe wallet we've got account abstraction what does gnosis want bankless listeners to know today David So notice now safe is dropping safe core which is an account abstraction toolkit of sorts to make it easier for you Builder to build account abstraction tools so this makes it easier to hook in things like Fiat on and off ramps for gasless transactions like that means like paying for your transaction with stable coins and all the other things that really make account abstractions super powerful so in addition to this Dev toolkit to help make account abstraction these status quo for all ethereum wallets there is also a hackathon a new kind of hackathon where they are calling an anything goes hackathon and anything a anything a like in front of anything starts on May 1st so it's coming up very soon 2023 there is a non-technical hackathon so everyone's invited uh you can make memes you can make product ideas MVPs a lot more stuff is fair game so if you've never participated in a hackathon before this is a great opportunity to get your foot in the door into the ecosystem to build something you can also make a team and have team members if you are looking to find some friends in this page which is always useful so there is a link in the show notes for any of these announcements that you might have interested you whether it's the hackathon or the safe core account abstraction Dev package all that stuff is just a click away in the show notes that is safe.global slash core for more details alright let's get to the markets today with charts from our friends over at Kraken our favorite exchange the one we recommend for 2023 David we're looking at the Bitcoin price now what's it showing us on the week uh it's shown us down but only a little bit actually a medium amount started the week at 33 000 uh ending the week down five percent at twenty eight thousand dollars uh and so kind of top ticked it when we measured it last week so uh 33 was like the local high uh we are down now to the logo price of twenty eight thousand dollars back down below thirty thousand dollars sad sad below 30k above 30k I'm feeling good good I'm feeling bullish below 30k I'm like oh it's the bear Zone and we're oscillating between these these two um points it's a little bear Zone it's a cute bear little bear Zone okay yeah I feel the same way with eth what are we looking at in the week uh down 1.5 on the week start of the week at two thousand dollars ending the week at 1970. although we had some pretty strong price action both in Bitcoin and in ether this week ether got all the way up to 1000 or 21.50 almost I'd say yeah uh and then but now couldn't couldn't keep up the uh the above 2000 Toyota down 1961 it looks like so maybe down two percent in the week what's up with these uh green candles on the 13th and 14th um is that as a result of kind of staking is that what we're seeing sorry yeah that was withdrawala yeah that was pocapella like yeah exactly yeah everyone realized that like people that all the chappella withdrawal fud was just super fun yeah and then people like that no I'm not I locate it anymore I should probably buy have we retraced that we have changed a bit yeah uh the ratios up though which is where we're going to go to next uh okay so uh up four percent on the week so .069 nice uh uh so four percent gain on the ratio all right four percent gain on the ratio and total crypto market cap gotta tell you is 1.27 trillion dollars filling with the T so still in the still in the bull Zone above one trillion dollars is bull zone for me that's the first time you've ever getting given the number what compelled you to do that this week that's my dream just because it hasn't really changed you know like one point we've been it's just like look at this um look at this the last dude the crypto total crypto market cap chart looks yummy it looked good yeah zoom out to the max well I mean just like it's just been it's been clearly up and to the right for a while now yeah it really has like we're gonna start we're coming in on like uh we're starting to zero in it's a little bit early to say this we're starting in zero in on 12 months of green at least for ether because ether bottom last May Bitcoin Bitcoin bottom in November but ethers is almost at 12 months of green this is the point at which you're like um is this the early oh market and you kind of don't know yet you're kind of left wondering or is this just more of kind of the crab and this is going to persist like what's your best guess for 2022. we okay if we just it totally extrapolate very rigidly from past bull markets it's it was the 20 16 and 20 20 years that were the years of up only that no one knew were bull markets in that moment and so like it was a modest increase of like a 2X over a modest of 2x over one year of time it's like 2016. it was like a 2X in prices 2020 also a 2X in prices and I remember Ryan like in 2020 we were all like is this over yet and then covert happens like oh we're we're still in the depths of it and like from the Bitcoin and ether asset prices it was a strong performance of the year yet no one knew no one had realized that we were out of the bear market and it doesn't feel like those times does it feel like 2016 uh or does it feel like 2020 to you right now uh so if we go on the four-year Cycles we are still half a year away from that which is not far off and also I'm not going to pretend that like why we we rigidly project forward when things are different and change so you know what I mean we are within Striking Distance of that timing-ish you know that argument of why would we rigidly um project for but by the way just finish that thought so you know it could be 2019 rather than 2020. if we were rigidly um projecting Force like right now but I'm also actually I'm kind of still a fan of rigidly projecting forward David it works last time it freaking works almost every time not just last time it worked the time before and it worked the time before that it seems oh no but the time before that we were that was the first cycle I know but it's just uh these four-year types of Cycles seem about right and has nothing in my mind has nothing to do with the Bitcoin happening it just has to do with these boom bust Cycles I can see it's investing great appetite for tokens yeah and I remember people were like last time in uh 2021 late 2021 2022 and the whole super cycle idea sort of took off it's like why does it have to be like last time this time it's different we have all of us we're not going down we'll never see another you know above 50 drop from all-time highs this is a different asset class we've hit mainstream look at we have Tom Brady we have uh you know our names on uh Sports Arenas we're here we made it right and what happened the same exact pattern played out that's why I think the rigid projection is like my base case still even though it is the same base case base case ought to be the same until proven otherwise and it has not been proven otherwise anywhere no all right okay well let's go on let's talk about ethereum okay because now we are one week just over a week past the chappella upgrade so all like eth withdrawals are in so tell us about the numbers David I want to know if uh how many people withdrew or how much if withdrew how much eth deposited and what are we net gain or net loss and I'm expecting a net loss as we go into these charts but tell us the story here uh okay so I want all the listeners including you trying to think of uh think of the number so we'll start with the number of the number of ether that was staked to ethereum the moment that chappella happened which was 19 million and one quarter so 19 250 000. that was that was how much ether was staked when Chapel went live how much ether do you think is left in the beacon chain how much either we got left how much ether got withdrawed how much should we go down by yes how much should we go down by my guess or up I it's we could have gone up uh we definitely went down up is wrong okay I knew that uh my base guess would be about half a million eth down um because it didn't I mean yeah I haven't looked I haven't looked at all of the details here but you know price has been up my impression is there hasn't been a big flow for the exit exit queue and so down half a million that had that fair you are pretty damn pretty damn close a little bit shy uh you guessed half a million we were at like Point uh six point six five million ether got withdrawn so we were at 18 million 640 000 ether uh there have been two large withdrawal events uh it's been down and to the right with some brief periods of more deposits um faster more faster deposits than withdrawals but then very large uh withdrawals have come and just like nuked it right uh and so and who are these these blue lines on the chart right these Blue candles rather exactly and so these are uh the large entities that first big uh withdrawal is uh Kraken uh and then the second big withdrawals on the further right on the April 20th which was is that today yeah that is like within the last 24 hours are um coinbase and binance large other centralized service providers we were at 19 and a quarter million ether's sake number 18 million 637 000 ether staked okay so there we go so the bleed the bleed is what like 60 70k per day yes okay but there's there's an interesting story here first uh Kraken one of the biggest withdrawers is legally compelled to withdraw thanks to our good friend Gare bear we'll get to him um yeah uh coinbase and binance okay so like why are the other big centralized exchange exchanges withdrawing and so here is a snapshot in the last 24 hours so this was recorded Thursday um I'm on uh CEST at 5 p.m so I'm six hours ahead of Eastern time uh so it's it's binance has withdrawn a 25 of The Last of The Ether withdrawn the last 24 hours is binance 23 is cracking 18 is coinbase then we have 10 others um and so like why are all the centralized exchanges uh you're throwing their ether what's going on well now remember this is coinbase's CB eth and binance is whatever liquid taking derivative they have as well and then also cracking is legally compelled to exchange to withdraw what is happening is a reshuffling of people withdrawing their ether doing the thing we like Ryan the bankless thing of withdrawing their ether from centralized exchanges and also in addition to like while with jars are outpacing depositors depositor rate prior to chappella versus now is up bigly as well and so there's ether going out of centralized exchanges and then also being redeposited into the beach okay so so via other symptoms the deposit queue is higher than it was previously to shift the rate of deposit is about 3x yeah oh wow okay I didn't know that so the net is still down just because the net is yeah yeah deposits outweigh the the um sorry the withdrawals outweigh the deposits but the deposits are still up so you're calling this a reshuffling remember when we talked about this event as being sort of a snow globe where you just kind of shake the snow globe and then just eat steak deep is going to settle in different locations across the staking pools or solo stakers you're saying that is a possible explanation of of what's Happening here because we're getting the withdrawals certainly but we're still getting deposits inbound and it's just settling in a different uh location maybe solo staking maybe uh you know a more decentralized staking pool something like this I would say it's more definitive than it's a possible explanation you know we watched the largest R eth mint ever happen and so we'll get to that when we talk about the rocket pool Atlas upgrade uh very big upgrade I'm very excited about that so we know that rocket pool has absorbed a decent chunk of ether and then also the supply of solo stickers is also up bigly this has this has this is like one of the the this is like one of the coolest upgrades in a while because we are seeing liquidity leave these at large centralized economies of scale exchanges and migrate towards decentralized solo stakers the whole like wait a second thanks Gary hey Gary no he only because he only forced Kraken out he didn't do anything about coinbase but like I mean cracking crack yeah I mean people who had ether and Kraken are able to go do stuff with it and that could be I mean technically yes I think it's just funny we'll get to Gary but like it's just funny the tighter he squeezes on you know centralization the more it seeps out into decentralization so we got it that's a full case of crypto that's not that's not just like of an accidental feature that is the feature of crypto is like the harder people grab it the faster it decentralizes yep but okay so so go on so we're seeing a reshuffling go on here um there's some withdrawal I what do you think the bottom is going to be in this withdrawal like like for for instance um and by the way how long are the withdrawal kills cues at this point like if I want to withdraw if you want to go back a tab yeah we got the answer to that question right so there are uh there is 23 000 validators looking to withdraw which comes to 750 000 there which is currently in the withdrawal queue 750 000 ether is either throws you yes okay so that that is to be withdrawn now remember that is not all principle there is a both rewards and Principle as well so I think the bulk is going to be principal about 75 is is uh I think um principle versus rewards in the future that will flip it will be largely with rewards um being withdrawn once this whole like equilibrium once once the snow is finally shuffled it'll it'll flip in terms of rewards will be the main withdrawals and because uh rewards for your validated rewards are automatically withdrawn fun fact this withdrawal queue is now 17 days right if I start withdrawing right now I have to wait 17 days until I get it because that is correct the pipe is small and it's all trying to fit through but like at the end of this if we if we have the you know 600 000 or whatever that we've withdrawn so far plus another you said seven out of that so 1.5 million each Supply approximately once this withdrawal Q drains of Outback like eth going out and being redistributed reshuffled or actually not restaked potentially at the bottom at some point yeah and so if we had no large mass Exodus from centralized or like centralized service providers or anything like this it would bottom out maybe at 18 million maybe there's another wave I bet you it does not go below 17 million I feel pretty safe about that especially when the rate of solo staking I think is going to continue to be healthy at least in the short term So you you're predicting this doesn't drop any more than another you know 1.5 1.6 million eth I think that's right yeah I think that's right I don't think we go below I think it's safe to say we don't go below 17 million staked we are currently at 18.6 um it's very possible that we do not go below 18 million staked and that would be uh bullish that'd be very bullish that's the bullish outcome is if we stay above 18 million and then bullish is to not to say like a price bullish I'm just saying just like it's cool to see this it would be cool to see that uh do you see some of these charts on the Dune board too that you have from Hell Dobby Shadow Hill Dobby are stakers in profits right uh you know you could see how many people below when e well what is this showing us the amount of you they're showing you the price of ether at the time of ether deposited into the beacon chain it's not showing you the price that that ether was bought at it was only showing you the price at when The Ether was deposited and this analysis says about 50 of the stakers are in in in the money uh since they deposited and 50 are down uh from their deposit time which kind of makes sense given the timeline of when you could deposit it was mostly depositing during the bull run right and then partially uh during there's a healthy amount of deposits at the very beginning of the beacon chain which was launched in December of 2020 when the price was 700 yeah that's incredible that was a while ago now well very good so what are the takeaways from this David it's you know ethereum's not dead obviously there was not a run on ethereum them this is kind of to be expected we'll see a bottom Point pretty soon Justin Drake had said said after we we get the bottom on you know the amount of uh each staked uh withdrawn then we'll probably start to incrementally rise once again I think we're seeing early signs of that how much money and by the way how much money you can't like what is the reward rate what is the interest rate when you deposit eth right now uh the East stake right that is a yeah 6.7 because not only are people uh leaving which jumps which increases the East stake rate gas fees have been up lately uh and so you are getting um just under four percent you're getting 3.8 in terms of issuance for staking uh protocol issuance and you're also getting another 2.9 percent for execution layer rewards which is like Mev and transaction fees this is attractive 6.7 6.7 is big bro yeah that that's more than that's more than treasuries I mean that's why we're gonna I I think start to see eth uh flood back in is because this is a very yummy uh you know apy to make 6.7 is going to attract more ethos Capital where else are you going to park your eth uh you just said yummy the risk-free I said I said yummy yeah you're risk-free do you say dummy or yummy yummy well I said oh yeah in the episode and now you said it okay yes yummy it is a yummy interest rate and so like because uh this is the risk-free rate for ethereum right I mean how long ago David do we write those first posts 2019 2020 when we talked about ethernet internet Bond yeah the risk pre-rated the Internet it's finally true fine there it is you gotta love it when a plan comes together an eighth denominated returns I'm sad to say Ryan I don't think you and I will ever make a more a better prediction a better prediction in our lives ever then yeah we peaked in 2020 guys that was it it's all marginal improvement from here if any Ryan if you like yummy interest rates uh would you like a strategy to increase that interest rate from 6.7 percent to uh I got let me go down to my notes Here an even yummier uh 9.7 are you starting a Celsius V2 are you starting a centralized I'm talking about a way to increase your yield in a I do non-custodial decentralized way that also increases the health of the network how do I do this I'll let I'll The Listener is gonna have to wait because that is uh coming up in later on in the news but if we can get there we'll we can move on yeah uh I definitely want to hear that David so some uh yummy interest rates ahead but in order to do that we gotta get to the rest of the news David what else we covering today coming up we got to talk about uh how much of a main character Gary was that this last week uh so if you want catharsis if you did not watch Gary gensler's hearing remember the whole Gary Gary going to the principal's office thing well that happened uh and so we got to watch certain members of Congress absolutely Grill Gary so we are going to take those clips and play them for you in case you missed it but there's other things to talk about as well coinbase moving offshore and damn it I kind of just teased it but Rock and pulls Atlas upgrade uh changes the game with their economics and that's perhaps maybe the source of what I saw that's where I get my nine percent that's right perhaps yeah uh 9.7 uh but also in order to get all those things we're going to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to

wall experience as well so thank you ambeyer for pushing the frontier of smart contract Wallets on ethereum the grilling of Gary Gensler that's what happened in front of Congress this week it wasn't a full grilling but I think we're going to talk about uh some of the Congress members members of Congress who asked Gary the questions I think we all wanted him to be asked we've got some clips coming up but give us the high level here what happened this week David and what are we looking at on screen and so there was a hearing for Gary Gensler so that Congress specifically the house uh Financial Services committee called Gary Gensler in so they could ask him questions uh about a handful of things uh including including some non-crypto things but definitely some crypto things uh and so uh interestingly post the hearing the committee Republicans out of the financial services Committee of the house released this press release and the press release is titled committee Republicans Grill SEC chair Gary Gensler regarding his disastrous agenda which like I agree with like thank you for grilling him interesting very political very political they are making a very public statement that they would like you to know perhaps because constituent that the Republicans are grilling Gary Gensler like first off what's your take on that Ryan I was I'm surprised this is thefinancialservices.house.gov I'm I don't read these often these press releases but it is incredibly uh incredibly political right look at it look at the sentence today the Republicans on the house Financial Services committee held Gary Gensler accountable for his disastrous agenda that threatens the dominance of U.S capital markets and our competitiveness first of all I wholeheartedly agree yeah sex is all right this is not a neutral kind of press release that you'd read like yeah today we brought in SEC chair and we asked him some questions this is like disastrous agenda threatening dominance of U.S capital markets so they're just saying it they're just coming out and saying it in this press release and and certainly that was uh the tone of the questions that many Republicans specifically Congress members asked Gary yeah it's in this press release the uh the Republicans continue to force him to answer for his Reckless rulemaking agenda regulation by enforcement of the digital asset ecosystem and disregard for the Capital formation piece of the sec's statutory Mission digital assets like they're protecting digital Assets in the first paragraph of this press release um Patrick McHenry who I believe is like the chair of the house uh finance committee he was the guy like doing the conducting between like okay you you next House member you have five minutes to talk he was doing that job uh also grilled him on whether or not ether is a security so we got all of these clips ready to go uh so this is going to be called a highlight reel uh I think there's four of them McHenry Tom emmer Warren Davidson and then another clip about when Gary is given just 30 seconds by another house member to talk about whatever he wants and uh he chose to talk about something and we will talk about all of these things you ready to get into the Cliff's run here we go this is uh who Patrick McHenry we were just talking about um asking Gary Gensler whether ether is a commodity or a security let's play it ether is one of the um most popular digital assets and Powers ethereum blockchain back in 2018 then SEC Corporation Finance director Bill Hinman stated they believe ether was not a security uh last month cftc chair uh Benham expressed his view that ether is a commodity the State Attorney General of New York asserted in a court filing last month that ether is a security clearly an asset cannot be both a commodity and a security do you agree um I I it actually all Securities are commodity under the commodity and exchange act it's that we are excluded Commodities but I would agree that a security cannot be also an excluded commodity and an included commodity I'm sorry chair just to talk about the commodity exchange act more precisely okay so do you recognize how would you categorize either then look I think that the general sweep of what Congress did not just in the 30s but as amended I'm asking you you're setting your chair now to make an assessment under the laws as exists is either a commodity or a security without speaking to anyone I know you've repeatedly said you're not going to speak to one except you've spoken to one Bitcoin so I'm asking to speak to a second one the second largest market cap here and speaking to the tokens there's 10 to 12 000. there's a group of entrepreneurs I'm asking about one public is anticipating a profit based on the I'm asking a specific question chair ginsler I said this in private this should be no shock to you I'm asking this question is it I told you I was going to do this a commodity or security and again it depends on the facts so like he does it he knows he's I'm asking about the facts in a law sitting in your seat and the Judgment you are making and so uh Mr chair I think you you would not want me to prejudge because you have prejudged thank you Patrick McHenry asking the question his ether security and uh Gensler refuses to answer that's what that was right uh and uh that topic came up a number of times uh and like the consensus of people are like he doesn't he thinks they're all Securities he thinks everything is a security exactly for some reason Bitcoin maybe why we don't really know uh okay so what what is the next clip we're about to watch this is Tom emmer who comes in with an absolute grilling uh this is this was like awesome to watch I would not want to be in Gary's position so here's Tom emmer five minutes thank you chair Gensler I have a lot of questions in a limited amount of time so if you can keep your answers to either a yes or a no that will allow us to get through as many as possible sir it's not going to do that from your perspective is it more difficult now for the digital asset industry to Access Financial products and services in the United States than it was say two years ago uh sir I I'm not running one of those businesses if they came into compliance of reclaiming my time the answer is yes do you think you and the SEC have had a role to play in that I think we have a broader protect the American investor and the capital markets and reclaiming my time sir you have played an obvious role in that during your tenure at the SEC how many rules has the SEC finalized that actually accommodate the existing regulatory framework and are specifically to the digital asset industry so the crypto Market can come into compliance it's there Rule books that are on the books for years so we have not finalized any new role specifically with regard to crypto we've proposed some things in best execution we've also uh sir reclaiming my time the answer is zero and how many enforcement actions has the SEC levied against digital asset companies during your tenure sir I think it's probably 40 or 50. the answer sir is about 55. my understanding is that the biggest crypto failure in history is probably FTX at nine billion dollars were you the chairman of the SEC when FTX collapsed yes and how many times did you meet with FTX prior to their collapse I think my public record shows two you met it with FTX at least twice and arguably the second biggest crypto failure in history was Terra Luna who was the chairman of the SEC when Terra Luna collapsed sir we had brought uh you were sir reclaiming my time you were there are five members on the commission do you believe your speeches and interviews are to serve as the official position of the SEC there I can only speak for myself when I'm speaking again sir in a statement on the SEC website you are quoted saying the Kraken staking as a service enforcement action should make clear to the marketplace that's sacing as a service providers must register but again you haven't provided any rules for how that can be done I must remind you your public statements are not regulations it's not responsible to expect the American people to assume your statements are a substitute for rules do you agree with this statement regarding the digital asset industry the SEC needs additional Congressional authorities to prevent transactions products and platforms from falling between the regulatory cracks I think that it's a non-com largely non-compliant field sir again I asked you to comply with my questions and I'm asking you if you agree with that quote and I I'm going to tell you I'm quoting you from an August 3rd 2021 article where you uh and I believe you told the congressman Hill earlier that you need Congressional authority to regulate stable coins and stable coins happen to be a significant percentage of the crypto market so the question is when were you telling the truth to Mr Hill or to meet you've got to start answering these questions in a more uh transparent manner sir does it concern you by the way that your approach to the digital asset industry is actually driving this industry out of the United States we're trying to drive it to compliance and if they're not complying with the laws then they shouldn't be offering their products reclaiming my time uh Madam chair I would like to enter into the record this Wall Street Journal article from April 14 2023 detailing China's ploy to open its banking system to crypto firms in an effort to seize an opportunity created by our hostile regulatory environment which uh Mr chair you're a big part of without objection chair Gensler FTX was domiciled abroad and so is binance he had American consumers still had access to both you can't really think that pushing this industry abroad is going to protect American consumers when it hasn't several times in the past on your watch you say the crypto Market is Rife with compliance however existing SEC rules make no sense for blockchain-based companies and following them would actually kill these businesses your regulatory style lacks flexibility and nuance and as a result you've been an incompetent cop on the beat doing nothing to protect everyday Americans and pushing American firms into the hands of the CCP your intention to work against SEC Mission and put American investors In Harm's Way has been made very apparent sir it's been a year and a half since you've appeared before this committee you need to answer to Congress about the issues that you've had with the SEC staff Union the work environment you've cultivated the SEC that's led to hemorrhaging of senior staff the intellectual inconsistency of your regulatory treatment towards Bitcoin spot ETFs and your politization of capital formation opportunities treatment of certain specs and that's just you wasted word every single word he just said was useful well this is very this is very coordinated quite clearly like they some of the Congress members were just handing the ball off from one to another like you asked this question I'll ask this question that sort of thing here's the next ball pass to Warren Davidson who's calling to restructure the SEC and the removal of chair Gary Gensler let's listen to this chairman ginsler your record of failures to protect investors and abuses of power make it clear that we need to restructure the Securities and Exchange Commission the failures are many but let me cite some of the abuses you average more than two rules proposals a month you inappropriately provide inappropriately short comment periods you have unworkable and unlawful ESG disclosure mandates on the market you have essentially a hotel California rule for crypto where you can check in anytime you like but you can never leave you have endless Discovery with no resolution and no Clarity for the captives in the market you have unworkable proposals for overhauling Equity Market structure a de facto ban on crypto through proposed custody rule you have high staff turning over unhappy people leaving your office in unhappy companies and capital leaving our country to correct a long series of abuses I'm introducing legislation that removes the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and replaces the role with an executive director that reports to the board third where all authority would reside former chairs of the SEC will be ineligible under my proposed Bill and this isn't just my take it resonates across the political Spectrum the American people want Democratic access to Capital Retail investor participation you can't just exclude retail investors from markets and claim it's for their own good our markets need to function and flourish and I yield back wow they're calling for his removal with him on the spot this was definitely the grilling time that we saw David there are some other clips from others that we're not going to play today from um the more supportive side of Gary Gensler but could you tease those out because I know you watched this live I'm thinking of people like Maxine Waters who blew a kiss to SPF I believe at one point in time and also uh Brad Sherman yeah Brad Sherman big big Gensler fans it seems um so we're we're playing kind of the grill session side of things we we don't have time to play all of the clips but what was the Maxine Waters Sherman take and some of the uh you know the the Gary fans out there how did that sound yeah it's worth noting that this hearing was like over two hours long um and wow like you this is what we are provided just now is a very concentrated amount of just all of the things that are related to the crypto world that are like the things that we like right uh there are there was a hours of stuff that was kind of just like irrelevant to crypto there was some like seg investing and environmental stuff that was just like not related to crypto and then there were people like Maxine Waters who was just like throw in underhand pitches to Gary so he could just like knock them out of the park and also Brad Sherman who like thanked Gary for reigning in the crypto industry which we all know he didn't actually do uh and so like there is uh this was not this is not just like everyone just berating Gary Gensler these are like four people um four people who are who are just absolutely grilling Gary Gensler there was one moment which we're gonna play here where one of the members of the committee said uh hey Gary um I have 30 seconds of my time left do you want them and so here is what Gary chose to do with those 30 seconds uh I have about 35 seconds is there anything you'd like to share with us to if I yield my last 30 seconds to you well I if I could just note something about you you mentioned you're hearing about the recent events in the market and I would note there were three banks that failed uh and there was a handful a day so this last those four or five days and two of those Banks the first and the third that failed silvergate and signature were engaged in the crypto business I mean some would say they were you know crypto Banks and the third Valley back Gary actually when it failed you saw this countries the world's second leading stablecoin uh had three billion dollars involved there d-pag so it's interesting because of the bank and some crypto thank you narrative as well and my time is up thank you Mr chair David you and I were watching this part live and this kind of told me everything I needed to know because this um uh Congress member her questions weren't related to crypto at all not at all it was about some of the other things that you touched on the market yep and then she just asked a question of hey you have 30 30 seconds what do you want to say what does Gary want to say he wants to flood crypto he wants to blame and Associate the recent bank runs with crypto say Silicon Valley Bank was crypto signature crypto Bank look at this you know the stable coin and of course bankless listeners you know the full story of the bank run we've done many exhaustive episodes on why that happened this is not a crypto incident crypto didn't cause this at all actually the banking system itself it was the banks it was a problem of the banks but he is using his time to actually fight crypto which which tells me David everything I you kind of it was the conclusion for me on Gary Gensler I was I was just kind of hoping like well maybe there's a shred of neutrality in this individual as a regular in this person there's not there's not he is really anti-crypto and I don't know if it's just him I I have a sense David this is all part of like Gary's kind of front line for operation choke point I don't think it's just Gary inside of the administration or inside of DC he has been enabled to go do this at some point he might be the Fall Guy for operation choke point or this might Elevate his status I'm not sure what kind of political games are going on but it's very clear to me there is a contingent in DC that wants to choke out crypto and uh you know Gary Gensler is a Frontline operator in that contingent group we didn't play this clip but there was a moment I can't remember who asked him but the first questions that he asked that this um this house member asked Gary was did you work with Senator Warren ahead of time to prepare your answers to these uh are you serious they asked that did you yeah they know what's up and so like Gary said of course like no I'm I'm here of my independent thought no I did not do that I wouldn't like what did that what did that house rep know like where why did he ask that question like where did that where was the motivation for that question where'd that one come from what's up with that I mean just to emphasize too this was said said in one of the um the questions uh to chair Gensler the SEC filed 1500 enforcement actions yes Gary still missed FTX SB uh SPF and this is coming from Anthony susano this is his tweet he's retweeting Gary gensler's most recent influencer video tweet where he says serving at the SEC for two years has been an honor we filed 1500 enforcement actions and overseen tens of thousands of registrants his number one claim to frame the thing that he's most proud of is the first thing he puts first on this tweet is the 1500 enforcement actions and then reminds us that like well you missed the one that caused the harm though like what about he got Kim Kardashian David this summer you know 200 000 fine got that so so that was also a topic in the hearing uh one of the house reps was like um so you uh find Kim Kardashian for this ether Max did you go after the issuers and hey Gary starts responding like yeah so we find Kim Kardashian like two million dollars and the guy goes so no no no did you did you go after the issuers and Gary's like no we didn't what issuers they don't have that like I'm trying to be an influencer here Kim Kardashian Gary on Twitter yeah um this is a crypto Twitter dug this up too so uh remember that line of questioning from Patrick McHenry asking Gary is ether security is Etha security is Etha security this is a clip from 2018 not that long ago where Gary Gensler yeah this is when he was a professor at MIT before he was chair of um the Securities and Exchange committee and uh he's talking he's giving a lecture on cryptocurrency and ethereum let's see what he has to say uh but that was in 2014 and in 2018 the Securities and Exchange Commission has said regardless of what it might have been in 14 it's now sufficiently decentralized that we'll consider it not a security but in essence they raised 18 million dollars and We're Off to the Races sounds pretty chill with it back then my how things change David this is a take from you after observing the Congressional session there uh what's your take yeah so Maxine Waters uh again we didn't play that clip uh praised Gary Gensler was teeing him up so he could hit Grand Slams uh and then she's also the one that blew us we have a kiss Brad Sherman thanks Gary for reigning in crypto both of these two people are Democrats the person that gave Gary Gensler the 35 seconds to talk about whatever he wants also a Democrat Patrick McHenry a republican was the one that pressures Gary for Clarity on ether Tom emmer Republican grills Gary about everything the crypto industry has been saying and then there's the other clip that we played of uh the guy saying that your the whole SEC is like leaving they don't like you you're incompetent also a Republican and so like yo Democrats come on where where what you guys doing I mean I think we want to get um a Democrat on the podcast uh Richard Torres uh house rep out of New York uh Democrat uh Pro crypto um this is turning into a partisan issue and it really shouldn't be a partisan issue and it's very unfortunate it's very disappointing and you know I bankless does not skew in one political direction or another it's not right or it you know it's not left but it is very much anti-authoritarianism right and it's very much definitely not top down definitely exactly and so I mean I know this is a common part of the Democrat uh Democratic platform we're not hearing from anyone yet so it's unfortunate I think that's what you're reacting to here David yeah exactly while this was going on all right earlier in the week Gensler gets grilled the SEC has charged crypto asset trading platform bittrex and its former CEO for operating unregistered ex Securities Exchange brokerage and clearing agency and David what are the details here what sort of assets crypto assets is the SEC now alleging are actually Securities yeah so this was unique in that they actually named certain crypto assets which they called Securities um so bittrex if you haven't heard of that exchange is uh it was formerly a United States exchange it has been moving offshore uh based in Seattle actually this was actually the first call of the coin exchange that I ever traded icos on back in 2017. this was my first crypto exchange so I bought my first unregistered Securities on bittrex uh thank you bittrex I guess um it's been like losing in volume ever since 2017. uh omisego algarant Dash uh the monolith token uh iht I don't know what that is and NGC also don't know what that is our Securities and we say go like a 2017 Ico darling um one of those definitely a bunch of hype and hot air algorand uh is a more relevant crypto asset that apparently Gary has been a intellectual fan yeah and so here is some clips of Gary talking about algorithm one top of a blockchain technology today uh well maybe in five years it would be have the performance uh Sylvia mccalley's algorand that was five years ago by the way touring Award winner at MIT that I work with um Sylvia's got a great technology that has performance you could create Uber on top of it the question is then who would update the software he is now a Securities promoter by by his own degree and so that's not the only clip there's like other clips of Gary like frequently using like Al Green as the example and like sure it was developed at MIT he was a professor at MIT no one's real about anything he knew about it but just like it's it's funny it's kind of Gone full circle it's funny okay here's the thing right it's just like this assortment of uh crypto assets David what does this have in common to you like does this stick out in any way to you like yeah you say go out ground Dash like there's no consistency there's no Clarity the only theme is that these are this is struck you know that what year is it meme like these are all 2017 Ico tokens or like is that is that it is that the consistency here yeah but that's also when bittrex the exchange was the biggest and that that was when it was at its peak but yeah these are all like 2017 era tokens yeah there is no Clarity in the US if Gary Gensler can't even tell us if the second largest market cap crypto asset ether is a security or not and by the way he doesn't get to decide but he at least has to provide some clarity on what their future enforcement actions are if you can't tell us that about ether we have absolutely no Clarity that that was so that's what was so maddening about his testimony in front of Congress David is he kept saying things like there is Clarity crypto just needs to come in and comply they they're they're the ones that aren't complying and yet we clearly see we have no Clarity and this just looks like a grab bag of assets just to really drill down on like how there's no theme with these tokens omiseko was an Ico it was a token is still a token on ethereum that raised 25 million dollars in an Ico it was like one of the biggest airdrops of all time because they airdropped OMG tokens through any and all ethereum wallets that have at least 0.1 ether in it if I can remember so that was an erc20 token on ethereum that did an Ico Dash was a layer one proof of stake proof of work hybrid token that also had privacy involved it was a layer one uh I don't know if it was a Monero chord code base it was something a Monero something like that something something like that yeah but like layer one not not like semi like semi-expressive contracts but no tokens no I don't think if they're maybe there was an Ico uh algorand another layer one uh tkn another erc20 token on ethereum so like no coherency there's across the board yeah I mean if these are tokens then every or if these are securities then everything's a security uh yeah just that's the point we just don't know but I guess it does think that yeah uh this is your take on the bittrex enforcement action yeah so I just tweet out um this charge against bittrex is too spineless to go after the major exchanges who by extension are doing the same thing like omisego I think it got delisted from coinbase but like once upon a time listed on coinbase so like this this charge against bitrex basically says that every single crypto exchange probably your crypto exchange listener is an unregistered Securities Exchange well I mean you're saying too spineless and I agree with you he's not like immediately driving coinbase out but um this is certainly a chilling effect and telling Kraken they can no longer stake um you know there's a Wells notice out at coinbase who knows what that says um he's definitely coming for some of the larger exchanges next which brings us to to coinbase this week coinbase got a Bermuda license and they plan to launch an offshore Exchange in the coming weeks this has got to be for redundancy purposes a backup option for sure and uh Brian Armstrong said as much the coinbase CEO won't rule out relocating the company away from the United States that's what he said in some statements at a conference in the UK a few quotes from that I think the U.S has the potential to be an important market for crypto but right now we are not seeing that regulatory Clarity that we need I think in a number of years if we don't see that regulatory Clarity emerge in the U.S we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world talking about moving coinbase outside of U.S borders the compliant exchange that's what coinbase has always tried to be and from everything I've seen like they have been sort of the straight A student from the classroom always raising the hand like the teacher's pet of exchanges basically an explicit BD strategy for them yeah is to be compliant if they and compare them to binance for instance right we'll compare them to you know SPF and FTX and all of that um so if they can't make it in the US who can is the question so it's like thanks a lot Gary you are now driving our compliant honest good exchanges outside of the borders of the United States that is what is happening to be clear they're not shutting down their main they're not they're not this isn't a new exchange this is like yeah you know binance us to finance FTX us to FTX um it's sad that those are the two things that I have to compare coinbase to to make the point um I would expect the coinbase international version would be just as compliant as the United States version as again as an explicit strategy but this is what this is just the context that that this is operating Under And if some of you are thinking well that's just centralized exchanges and you know centralized exchanges will be regulated by Regulators guess what Gary is not satisfied with that either all right Gary wants the definition of an exchange to Encompass decentralized exchanges as well this is uh actually another thing that happened this week the SEC wants to redefine the definition of exchange to include decentralizes exchanges and so that means if a decentralized exchange if this rulemaking passes fails to register as a national Securities exchanger a broker dealer in the U.S there will be civil penalties basically Gary and a team are saying that if you are opening up a uniswap or a sushi swap or any sort of decentralized exchange you have to get permission in the SEC come in for office hours with Gary Gensler first and then like maybe we'll let you have it if what like the uniswap code has if we don't list all of the Securities which we don't even know which like this is first of all it's unenforceable because it's a smart contract code but like secondly this is quite the chilling effect for all U.S entrepreneurs developing on D5 what does that mean if I'm like developing a D5 exchange I have civil penalties they're gonna charge me with like five to ten million dollars if I like release this code into the wild this is open source code this is exactly the the point that coin Center is making of course our faithful uh crypto Educators and lobbyists in a DC they put out a post on this um they filed a comment explaining why it's unconstitutional that the SEC is proposing to change the the the term exchange to mean decentralized exchange they say this the effect of the definition on open source software developers is nonetheless clear anyone writing or Distributing deck software would be violating the law if they don't register and they go on to say this is a free speech violation Gary Gensler you don't have the authority to regulate Free Speech open source code in the United States of America like what why are you reaching into this too right it's uh absolutely crazy to me there's some reactions we could talk about but I want to get yours first what's your take on this so when I was going through the agenda I like made a comment on this one I was like I don't really get what this is uh let's flag for removal and you were like no no no this is a really big deal and so I want to read the title of this piece because the title is very intentional the title is a new SEC proposal has a serious change hidden within its complex language and this didn't really get there was a lot of fanfare about Gary in the SEC today this didn't get much attention versus the clips of Gary on Twitter and also the bittrex and the bittrex thing which led to Gary the influencer promoting algorand which he deemed a security perhaps this is actually the biggest news of the week the fact that the SEC is now saying that had dexes must come in and register which is uh impossible obviously uh and like the whole hidden within its complex language thing we can only assume is intentional and they were successful in at least like slipping it under the cracks to hide it behind I mean even when we organized this roll up we are talking about it third in the third thing because the other two things I mean we're more in people's brains here's the thing David is the agenda to me is Crystal Clear it's two things either I control it or I kill it those are the two options that this agenda is pursuing so this is an effort to control defy and if I can't control it I kill it that's what's happening uh Hester purse of course dissented um she's got some colorful uh comments here that uh maybe we'll we'll read out just to refresh the palette let you know that not everyone is is crazy here uh let me read this today's commission aggressively expands its regulatory reach to solve problems that do not exist today's commission treats its basic approach to exchange regulation as something that must not indeed cannot be altered to allow any room for new technologies or for new ways of doing business and I love this part today's commission tells entrepreneurs trying to do new things in our markets to come in and register when entrepreneurs find they cannot the commission dismisses the possibility of making practical adjustments to our regular regulation framework to help entrepreneurs register and instead rewards their good faith with an enforcement action today's commission treats the notice and comment rulemaking process not as a conversation but as a threat a hundred percent that is the posture of this SEC regulatory team under Gary Gensler that's why we're giving it so much time and attention is because I think this is the guy on the front lines of operation choke point and it's getting the point David where we have to resist or else what we have to like leave the country like what like this is getting it's it's just absolutely crazy yeah I we need to move at some point move on because I know we're like we're an hour into the show this is a very big deal all this stuff is a very big deal I think I'll just leave listeners with this remember um with Elizabeth Warren like one or two weeks ago when she was the main character and she was like I'm building an anti-crypto army and then there's uh oh you weren't there it was me and it was me and Anthony uh for that week because you were out on vacation one of the big um uh journal the the news reported that like uh and this move by Elizabeth Warren has attracted some positive remarks from Bank lobbyists and and banks in general and so banks have made a big move and now we have um the whole choke point 2.0 with Treasury and Janet Yellen and then also we had uh that one at house representative who said to Gary Gensler did you prepare your questions in advance alongside Elizabeth Warren so my question is what axis is operating behind the scenes to coordinate all of this stuff to give Gary the con evidence to be so audacious to do all of these things when like what what backstop does he have that somebody will catch him yeah he's a general in the Elizabeth Warren Army whatever that Army consists of yeah I think the Elizabeth I mean Elizabeth Warren definitely like you know the commander Sherman of that Army right um that's a World War II reference not Brad Sherman yeah benefits but then also just like it's the banks the banks are the last line of defense we are seeing the Gary Gensler to me is here's our take is just a manifestation of the will of the banks well he's certainly uh funding it whether it's the banks or the The Establishment the institutions in general as certainly what's behind this and I guess David at some level what did we expect we're in crypto we're disrupting power structures what did we expect at some level I'm surprised this didn't start to happen sooner but now it's happening we've got to fight on our hands and so we got to do our part if that if it is true that there's like this power axis and Gary gensler's the front and we have a few other people in the front Janet Yellen Elizabeth Warren but there's like this axis of power and it's like the last line of the the people in the rear restaurants or the banks I'm the only thing I'm surprised is like I guess I'm not surprised what were you gonna say though that it's that it's coordinated that they're they're able to do this they're getting into the SEC they're they're like what did the banks like get together and sit down at their table and be like all right how do we do this and like Gary get him into the SEC get him to charge crypto it's like damn it took some forethought and some yeah well here's the thing and it's it's not always the case that kind of the the best value system wins or the you know best thing for the people wins or anything else it's it's only the coordinated survive and so if they can out coordinate us they can win but I am hopeful bankless nation that we can out coordinate them and we have an asset that they don't have on their side I'm not talking about a financial asset here I'm talking about the people this is a decentralized technology anyone should be able to own their own digital property and we can build this from the ground up and so that's why I think the crypto movement's all about and also why we've been talking about coordination the entire time on this podcast from the beginning of Bank list because it's all coordination in the words of good old Kevin owaki it's all coordination all the way down can we out coordinate the banks I hope so and I think so uh we got more to talk about let's stop with Gary what's coming up next David uniswap wallet gets out of jail so you can all go download the uniswap wallet if you so choose uh a new OP stack client just dropped the first ever layer 2 Ryan that has a second client that's pretty cool uh the Solana phone is out and about and also we're going to start with this as soon as we get back rocket pools Atlas upgrade is where you can get extra yield on your yield because yo dog I heard you like yield uh so we'll talk about all of that and more as soon as we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Kraken has been a leader in

Citizens only I'll see you in the Discord David you promised us some yummy yields earlier in the show is this the part where we get to the yield what's happening yeah this is the third time we said the word gummy on the show okay so the rocketpool atlas upgrade uh what is the Atlas upgrade uh first off how does rocketpool work rocket pool your friendly neighborhood decentralized staking as a service provider people who want to allow our eth to be minted they will come in with 16 ether half of what's usually required they will spin up a validating node and they will deposit their 16 ether and they will allow 16 other ether to come in to their node to create one node of 32 ether and then 16res will be minted and that is the re that you would buy on balancer or unit swap that's how rocket Pool Works the atlas upgrade reduces the collateral demand for Rocket pool from 16 to 8 and so it doubles the capital efficiency because it allows for doubling of the supply of nodes also why what's the incentive to run a rocket pool node for people who want to actually deposit their 16 ether and allow for 16 other people to come in they those people get to charge the other half of their node 15 percent so if the stake rate is 6.7 which it is you get you get that yield but then you also charge 15 of that 6.7 percent of the people that backfill your node make sense so far yes so you're saying to get that extra interest boost I have to run a rocketpool node yes correct you run a rocket pull out you deposit half of a node and then you get to charge the other half of the ether 15 of their yield with the rocketpool atlas upgrade I think you can see where this is going the collateral requirement goes from 16 down to eight so if you let's say you have 32 ether uh just because 32 is the numbers we've been thinking about with rocketpool before you would be able to create two rocket pull nodes put 16 ether in each and then you would charge 15 of the 6.7 of other people's 32 ether so that would net you a boost of 7.7 yield so you would go from 6.7 to 7.7 an extra one percent great uh rocket pool now it's an eight eth requirement for one node so that 32 eth instead of just being divided into two nodes 16 and 16 actually creates four nodes because that's how math Works uh and so you can get to spin up four rocket pool nodes and you get to try charge fifteen percent on 96 ether and you are the remaining 32 um to create four nodes and so that juices the deal the yield because you are charging 15 of the uh 6.7 yield that 96 ether that's not yours is getting you would ultimately come to about 9.7 yield if you run four rocket pool nodes which you need 32 each to do and so that's the rocket pool upgrade everyone's super stoked about it it is like I said doubling the capital efficiency of Rocket pool as you will and I mentioned this in order to get that in order to get that boost David I have to not only run a rockable node but I also have to have 32 eth is that right correct yes that's right or 16 or 8 although it does cost some gas Feast um to Mint one so like doing it for eight is probably not viable the last I checked um and so we've already seen some economics so uh there are some charts that we're going to look at as well the largest R eth mint so here's the upgrade announcement that's just a link in the show notes so here is a graph of r e being minted and you can see the absolutely whopping colors going big two big mints yeah so there was one mint of like 12 000 our eth in one day and then one at like 8 000 so our eth supply which has always been the thing that's like constrained rocket pulled the most is the capital efficiency and these not as capital efficient as uh you know your your centralized exchange staking or even light up stinking is it but that's the trade-off not as capital efficient but more decentralized exactly yeah so the mo the most decentralized taking as a service provider on ethereum has doubled it Capital efficiency so that's that's the news there's some other cool upgrades to rockable Atlas if you want to learn more about those there's a link in the show notes this is really cool doing analytics board uh yeah uh and so what is the re Supply these days um there are almost 11 000 minters and there's almost a quarter million our eth out on the market but that supply has only gone up over time I really hope it goes up I would love to see like rocketpool decentralized staking to be like you know a third of the network at least I don't think I think they've self-capped themselves to below a third they've self-top themselves to 20 percent there's a ton of other more decentralized um you know staking pool providers coming on the scene too so hopefully it's part of that space is about to get very competitive I'm glad I'm very glad okay this is uh another competitive space this is layer twos introducing Magi is that how you say it Magi our brand new OP stack roll-up client written in Rust what is this David what is Magi Magi Maggie Maggie is the second client for optimism for the op stack optimism Bedrock is using the op stack therefore any op stack chain now has a client and so this is really important infrastructure for a the decentralization of layer twos because having multiple clients is its anti-fragility it's resilience resilience it has that though really Solana has one in development but it looks like a layer two beats Solana to the punch sorry Solana has a phone David we'll get to that later we'll get to the Solana phone in a second um anyways this is the idea of this the net effect of this is that a optimism itself can become more decentralized but we can also produce more op stack chains and this has always been and is the bull case for optimism is 10 000 op stack chains Bloom this op stack client is written in Rust for the developers that like rust which apparently there are a lot of them this was also developed by a16z which is a investor kind of cool I mean a VC an evil VC and um but also giving back to public goods giving back to the community this is open source code so go first out there let's name them let's get let's get the uh T right now um that's a different show we'll save that for the premium feed David yeah this is a uniswap Labs of course they had their wallet that was coming that was that was locked in jail from uh Apple this is a non-custodial wallet from uniswap Labs uh and it just went live actually last week late last week after we recorded the last roll up it went live and the uniswap mobile wallet is now out of applejail live in most countries a fantastic ux we did an entire episode on this with the the lead designer at uniswap we'll include a link to the show notes I think the call to action is if you're on the bank list Go download the uniswap wallet go check it out it's a non-custodial wallet okay this is one of those things we've been we've been waiting for and very cool that uniswap is developing tools for the ecosystem as well not just a decentralized exchange I've got my hands on the new software in test flight um I will absolutely download it in real in the real world it is very easy very intuitive we love it in there very cool um all right David we've got uh this story as well which is kind of concerning exploit targeting like crypto ogs of some sort we don't even know if it's an exploit the thing is we don't know about this story which is why it's really hard to report on like what's going on here is uncertain and so here's um uh Taylor Monahan formerly my crypto wallet she tweets out for the past 48 hours and this is a few days ago I've been unwinding a massive wallet draining operation sad emojis uh I don't know how big it is but since December of 2022 it's drained over 5000 eth and unknown amounts of tokens and nfts and coins across 11 different Chains It's wrecked my friends and ogs who are all reasonably secure no one knows how and then here is like a graph of just like all of these transactions that she's mapped out uh so there is like this wallet draining thing and no one knows how it's happening um and so it's happening across different chains the people have uh come to consensus that it is a seed phrase exploit so there's something that's one guess right that's one thing yes yeah and so like if you've imported your seed phrase manually into metamask you might be at risk we don't know I have I've checked a wallet in which I have done that and it is fine uh there's not that much ether in it it's like half a year did you check when's last time you checked you should yesterday David yesterday [Music] um i i people are perplexed by this it's just weird right I mean like all the circles uh who bring this up were like hey this is very weird it looks like most of the people most of the ogs who've been wrecked by this have been very secure not doing anything silly like sharing their seed phrase you know publicly or uh even though there was a theory that oh could this be the LastPass hack are people keeping seed phrases in LastPass and that got hacked recently and maybe the hacker is just kind of like Brute Force attacking the last pass passwords and cracking them and then able to do these withdrawals that's been a theory but then I've heard that um well this affected non-lastpass users as well so it's just right now it's kind of at the rumor stage and I I've seen these rumors before in crypto but usually they have explanations at the end of it you'll get kind of a rumor of like there's some mysterious draining of wallets and then like a couple days later or a week later do you remember the Hue car pack where he got hacked for like we did an episode on this he got hacked for like it was like 20 million dollars yeah he had no idea how it turned out was a man in the middle attack from a Microsoft Word document yeah that he got yeah and so ever since this story when whenever I've sent Ryan a doc I don't do this anymore but like I sent Ryan a docx file he's like get that  thing no for me get it away I'm not clicking on that well but like because what it did was it it somehow replaced his metamask yeah with a man in the middle metamask like exact position and so that was scary but I haven't heard of that you know lately so we don't know what's going on here so if you bank this nation citizen are concerned about this uh the only thing I can really recommend is uh grab a ledger and spin up a new seed phrase a new hardware wallet and migrate your funds there and then you can consider yourself fully protected uh if you're already on a ledger and you haven't exposed your funds you're probably fine um it's probably the same thing that's what I I have that's where I keep my money and I haven't moved mine um but I am keeping my eyes on my wallet that I did import the sea trades manually into metamask that one time so if I get yeah if I get my point for something East snagged and well no then we'll know unless the hacker is listening and they choose not to uh not to they're like David tell them tell them to it's all safe speaking of that metamask wanted us to let you know as well that the recent reporting on this incident has incorrectly claimed that a massive wallet training operation is a result of a metamask exploit this is incorrect this is not a metamask specific exploit so some people were saying oh it must be metamask and this is metamask saying no it's it's not a metamask specific exploit we're actually not sure what caused it but like your metamask should be safe right by default they have found wallets that have been exploited that are not metamask Wallace so uh deducing that it's not and then a mask issue there you go reminder to get a hardware wallet protect yourself a good bankless advice here David the Solana phone is now live Saga the flagship security conscious crypto first Android device from Solana mobile is now available here it is we did an episode with Anatoly on this uh and now it's out on the market uh when you get in your phone David when are you getting your Solana phone I'm waiting at the door well that's cool I mean look the vision is very cool the version's very close I shouldn't belittle it it's a very big deal it's totally unfair of me actually do you know what do you know why it's cool it's because um we're just talking about uh uniswap being like locked in jail they couldn't actually yes they had the app ready last year and apple wouldn't allow them to release a uniswap custodial non-custodial wallet in the marketplace and so crypto's going like well if Apple and Google kind of control our phone interfaces we need a crypto first alternative and so this is a Solana's attempt at doing that and I think it's got a good Vision it's open source there's a lot of good aspects to it I think the thing that many of us are worried about is well it's really hard to be in the phone business like it's a Cutthroat business you need large Network effects and can a you're going to compete with apple and in Android it's tough but like again it's an extremely Noble effort either Android had them have more faith in apple but like either they come to us and serve us as a global or we have to do or Community or we have to do this and so like tip of the hat to Solana mobile for pioneering this effort it's an extremely heavy lift um so yeah there's that yeah thanks for funding it uh Mattel doing nft stuff it's the toy company Mattel is bankless listener do you know what Mattel toy company is well do you know what Barbies are do you know what Barbies Hot Wheels Fisher Price American girl I don't know that one Thomas and Friends Thomas the Tank Engine uh Uno and mega so that company that owns all those things has launched a digital Collectibles Marketplace on the float blockchain that's actually I would say the appropriate destination for this I mean eventually they should do a ZK evm on a layer two um but for now flow makes sense yeah there you go uh how about these Trump nft cards he sold out the first batch now they've been down only since he sold out but uh time for Trump to release series two and they've also sold up of the nfts so uh Trump really bullish on nfds said this in the tweet my new Trump Digital Collection Trading Card Series 2 is the number one collection in the world must be that the people love the art a great honor you think the people love the artist I don't know man uh I've seen some of this art it's uh I mean I guess love is you know some people might use my Beauties in that but I hold it right so the floor price of these nfts went they were previously at 0.4 they are now at 0.13 because they just inflated the hell out of the supply so there's a problem with nft there's 14 000 of them prior and now there is going to be 47 000 more of these things just the fact that they are still at .13 is insane it's impressive I don't know who's buying this but uh I think Trump will keep selling them as long as people will buy them yeah I think right make sure of that if if you I the last person I would ever put in charge of the money printer is Donald Trump separation of powers here releases today one inch is being deployed on ZK sync era so the new ZK evm getting one inch the defy exchange aggregator very cool welcome to the club that's what they say in the message and then this is uh some big news actually Apple card Apple now has savings accounts at 4.15 apy I use the Apple card I use apple cash so I guess I now have a 4.15 savings account not as high as ethyield um I will know uh but it's conveniently on your phone uh and so uh it's really cool interesting pivot yeah I like it it it goes to show that sort of um you know big Banks so this is all powered by Goldman Sachs that is the new D5 yield pool I remember we were messing with these high yield pools and well um you know bank accounts were giving yield of like 0.15 right well now because Fed rate is so high interest rate is so high a Goldman Sachs can offer this and they're Distributing this 4.15 apy through Apple which is uh kind of interesting but it's on that theme of remember we're talking about the bank run this idea of a slow-motion crash of like well a slow motion Bank Run of all of the yield all of the savings and all of the money bleeds out of small mid-sized Regional Banks and goes into the larger banks in search of higher yield thus making the small Regional Banks insolvent that's this David all right this is Apple has 50 of the US smartphone population 45 million people are like you and they have Apple pay on their new account and that is 4.15 I'm getting my money out of my you know Local Credit Union and I'm putting it in this new yield pool it's not going to be so good for the Local Credit Union is it cool um so and there's another story here which is like this idea of like all tech companies eventually become a bank right and this is not Apple going as far as becoming a bank but certainly becoming a fintech right front end right and using um Goldman Sachs as its banking layer so interesting stuff I think in the world of of Trad five this week with this uh this announcement I just checked my phone I don't have access to this yet so ah okay I will continue with my point zero one percent from Wells Fargo thank you uh the permissionless conference David what is this announcement not permissionless 2023 permissionless two so here is the uh teaser reveal from permissionless it's 45 seconds here we go 2022 was a meme the collapse of FTX has sent shock waves across the cryptocurrency industry Skeptics danced Believers believed Bitcoin is going to zero it's just a ridiculous that anybody would buy this stuff The Tide is Shifting and it's time to rebuild [Music] hey there it is okay how do you like the the vaporwave vibe I love that 90s vaporwave yeah this is great so what is this David what is this conference about uh this is permissionless number two if you didn't go to permissionless one it was held in West Palm Beach Florida this is going to be held in Austin Texas it'll be my first time in Texas and it is going to be uh the second permissionless the first permission list I will say it was like the unique point about permissionless is if it was a ton of crypto natives like bankless listeners like bankless the bankless nation showed up absolutely in four spankless Dao was there like all the people that we've had on the podcast were there and so it's like a bunch of crypto natives in this like very well manicured and orchestrated venue managed but like just seamlessly operated by by the blockworks team uh and so that unique there was that unique Vibe it was just like a ton of crypto natives which are usually associated with like coordination failures and indiness and just like clunkiness but instead of that part it was like this super smooth and operated uh uh conference because the blockworks team are absolute Jazz at this uh so permissionless too in Austin Texas is going to be about 10 to 20 bigger than last year even though we are twice as more into the bear Market than we were the last time um and I'm pretty stoked so I'll see you all in September in Austin uh this is the only conference I go to every year this is the only time I ever see Ryan this is um this is the one to go to if you have to pick one and by the way bankless citizens get a 30 discount on the tickets which more than pays for itself uh I think if you are a bankless citizen and you pay for Bank lists the ticket discount that you get pays for your bank list citizenship automatically there you go instant Roi David what do we have coming up next coming up next we got questions from the nation to hot questions and also two takes of the week and also two people on this podcast tell you what they're bullish on so we're gonna get to all of that and more as soon as we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before

times faster than before visit arboretum.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free we're back with some questions from the bank list Nation this one from canis does Bitcoin really have to be sustainable is the question what if Bitcoin becomes the store of value like gold and the big players have the incentive to keep it secure just like gold owners the rich government Banks Etc we're building fortresses safes paying guards Etc maybe this is the case for bitcoiners as well they preserve their wealth by keeping your network secure by buying mining rings and spending power at their own cost because this is their main store of value I think the question is David does Bitcoin actually need to have a sustainable monetary policy what do you think yeah so we're actually conflating a few things here uh and I can see I can see how that confusion set in but it's really important to parse out some of this stuff um first where does Bitcoin or where does gold get security from it's not from like the guns and the armies that protect the gold this is kind of nuanced but it's really important gold actually gets its security from atoms from like energy like gold was made in the explosion of stars and so gold does not fall apart because it's extremely atomically stable and also it does not fall apart monetarily because the amount of energy it takes to create gold molecules is insane like it's it's costs you more of energy cost to produce gold atoms than it does to uh then then you would be able to net out of the result of that yield of the gold is economic security comes from that's why gold is valuable this is why Alchemy has never worked right like you can't turn straw into gold you can't turn anything into gold it's another way to say that David is like gold already paid its proof of work energy costs right in the form of a supernova yeah until until we can uh blow up Stars we have that sort of energy um possibility we actually can't create gold right in a cost-effective way but go on and then there's the incentive to protect your gold right like the guns the the you know the fortresses all of that stuff and that would be like your cost of buying a ledger or the cost of like storing a seed phrase somewhere which by the way cryptography makes extremely cheap and accessible to all and so these are actually different things the where it breaks down with Bitcoin is that the reason why this doesn't work with Bitcoin why Bitcoin is not sustainable is because proof of work in the Bitcoin blockchain you as a gold holder you don't actually care about protecting other people's gold so there is a tragedy of the commons problem here where like you as a gold holder you want other people to pay for security to protect your gold but you don't want to pay for the protection of other people's gold and so that is a transaction cost right the P it's the transactors that are paying the transaction fees in Bitcoin that pay for the security of everyone else but in the gold model like the I need to keep my gold safe uh you pay for the custody and care of your own gold but in the Bitcoin model you are just hoping that other people pay for your security not you and so that's where it falls apart yeah I think uh sometimes the the strong Bitcoin statement misses this hidden um I I guess hidden virtue about gold and that is gold has already paid its security budget Nature has paid it in the Supernova of a star whereas Bitcoin has to pay its security budget every single block every single year on an ongoing basis for now until forever if you want that unforgeable costliness which is baked into gold at the periodic table level on bitcoin you actually have to issue more Bitcoin to pay for it or make up for it in transaction fees and the problem is if everyone's holding their Bitcoin and the transaction fees are low and by the way this is kind of timely did you see David arbitrim layer 2 transaction fees Revenue actually um past Bitcoins past Bitcoins transaction fee Revenue pass basically it's it's you know the more sustainable part of its way of paying for for security um anyway that that aside Bitcoin has to keep paying this over and over and over and the only way it can pay for it is issuing new Bitcoin which is going to run out it's going to go to zero in time or transaction fees you know that that's why this won't work that's why we have said for a very long time before I think this was more my widely known and I think many Maximus still don't accept this that Bitcoin has a major security budget problem in the future the only way for Bitcoin to solve this is really to like I mean can migrate to proof of stake like we've talked about this um it can do a lot of things that are very untenable to the core of Bitcoin Community exactly so it's going to be a problem at some point and it's just a matter of how long they can kick the can down the road and I think they will they'll have another like good five they got like yeah no five years I'd say they got like four to five more happenings so they got like probably but it's just before transactions start getting reversed but it's already becoming embarrassing because we can see now a layer two has outstripped it yeah like arbitrum is more secure than Bitcoin how is that like how is that possible from an economic security perspective yeah um bitcoiners will say that was an overly like reductive way like arbitrine versus Bitcoin and there's like you could debate that I'd be happy to debate any of them on that like yeah it's just this is this is what a lot of Bankers I think modern listeners don't mean my first podcast before bankless hey most banquil sisters don't realize I had that podcast and it was me and a bitcoiner yelling at each other it's my like really good friend from college like we've had all of these conversations what's ad nauseam ad nausea like over here over and over again yeah and this is why we like have moved on from it as like a community because it's like we've done this before we have the archive is full of it uh let's get to take to the week so takes the week here we go here's the take from Blake West it's pretty frustrating to hear people mock crypto like it's been 10 years and it's still just speculation where's the value when in reality it's basically illegal to use crypto for Meaningful stuff I want to yell at Regulators let us try and he goes through these examples are these examples worth reading David there's a lot of videos here there's only no there's only six examples it's definitely worth reading okay instant stock trade settlements plus eliminating Clearinghouse fees except it's illegal to list Securities natively on chain that's one uh two liquid transparent exchanges that perfectly comply with regulations for alternative assets like loans real estate Etc with lower no feeds except creating exchanges of any kind is highly regulated in the United States and crypto changes can't register anywhere see coinbase versus CC three we can eliminate the possibility of exchange taking users funds if We've ran them custodial non-custodially but again it's effectively legal to run an exchange on chain non-custodial with actual bonds and stocks next we could have had instant 24 7 transactions among Banks years ago instead of the two to five days with ACH except it's illegal for banks to hold crypto or put deposits on chain next we could use stable coins to make payments directly to Merchants with no card fees Bank fees or chargebacks but remember DM yep declared illegal also transacting in crypto even a stablecoin's taxable event making it operationally prohibitive last regulatory reporting burden for funds and exchanges would be much cheaper if they were on chain because it's automated in public and Regulators wouldn't have to subpoena records except there's no clear path for funds and exchanges to run on chain really less clear and concise use cases that would glow up the Trad fire World in a zero to one moment for all of these things and they're all legal wow yeah that's a great point I I do think the worst uh the the big user experience problem for cryptos actually government one of the worst uh like one of the biggest hassle things I have to do in crypto I know I talk about it all the time so it's become a meme is taxes it's freaking taxes every time you do anything you pay some gas well it's capital gains on that gas like from eth purchase so you have to track that somewhere like you you make one transaction on ethereum you set off like a Rube Goldberg machine of compliance yeah that like 17 people have to touch totally and it doesn't have to be this way um anyway great take from Blake West uh what's this one from Ben DeFrancisco so Ben Defrancesco is retweeting a tweet of uh somebody saying uh making fun of the line the United States dollars backed by nothing so you know the line says dollars backed by nothing and then the nothing and we are watching a clip of like uh Naval Armada plus fighter jets flying overhead and like it's okay he's like no the if you violate the dollar we're gonna send this like massive Army after you so yes this is what we say on Bank list quite a lot uh the United States is backed by the military and so Ben's take getting to the Ben's take is like even if this is correct it's pretty Grim morally speaking because what are these things what is the dollar backed by bombs violence and guns and violence and impression hmm thanks Gary I think that's I think that's an element of it it's also I would say you know economic competition is a big piece of this that might be missing but yeah it is somewhat disturbing when you kind of like peel back all of the settlement layers for Humanity and even like Civilization and you find at the bottom settlement layer is can I bash my head like can I bash this club on your head and take what you have it's like violence as the final settlement layer and that's just what nation states have mechanized and we call them militaries and we call it defense I'm not saying that's a good or a bad thing I'm just saying it's a thing and um I mean that that there's an element of truth to this and yeah there's I think Ben is also right it is pretty Grim morally speaking I don't know what to do about that though yeah it reminds me of that quote from dalio is like above the nation state is the rule of the Jungle below the nation state order you know you stop at stop signs you pay your taxes you know you don't steal above the nation state you Club people on heads yeah and you just have to have the bigger Club um David what are you bullish on this week uh something completely different like I've seen it at Montenegro uh there's this huge longevity in Wellness um cohort of people and it's been like waking up this very dormant part of my brain which is like the wellness part and so like every every morning 7 A.M go on a run 8 A.M cold plunge with like 20 other people who are like cold punching in the Adriatic Sea like then I go to the gym and do some weight lifting and then I go eat like the most insane at least large breakfast that you'll ever see uh and it's just like waking up this like lifestyle that I had pre-crypto and I'm sad to say actually that like I kind of like jettisoned it in the getting into crypto but I'm getting it back and I've been very thankful and this is kind of what this whole like zuzalu experiment has been able to do for many people not just me um is to see what your life could be like if you can figure out how to prioritize everything and have just maximum Serendipity and be able to focus on what you want to focus on and so I Ryan and and also I'm producing content on Longevity if you want to learn more about longevity and the intersection of crypto and Longevity and like design all this stuff so Ryan I am bullish on longevity and crypto people going down that rabbit hole so that's why I'm bullet shot see the the foodless podcast was not an April Fool's death joke that's actually something David is pursuing that's what it sounds like uh that's cool man yeah it's a lot of great topics and I do think it's important I think crypto people can get too plugged into the digital too plugged into the metaverse we've called it before like crypto brain or ethereum brain yeah and uh you're getting a taste of like grass in real life and health and things that are important you know away from screens it's important stuff I feel like I need more of that in my life yes so Ryan speaking of the person who's back home what are you both on well okay so um every week we ask this question and we're always bullish on something we can always find something to be bullish on and this is a very I would say our tone at bankless is super optimistic and it you know always has been and everything sometimes yeah yeah and uh don't get me wrong I'm very bullish on crypto right now like I'm just this technology is beyond where I ever thought it would be and like the impacts it's had and like its success in the future is you know all but certain all but guaranteed to me like it's it's tremendous I'm so glad uh we're in this industry um but I'm finding like this week in particular I don't know it's hard for me to be bullish on the rest of things like outside of crypto David so like maybe this is part of the uh Ellie zerudkowski existential crisis where I sort of like you know you dip in and out of these things like some week it weeks it's hard for me to be bullish on things like I've been listening to you a bit more of uh nick uh bolstrom an old episode on Sam Harris you ever hear his analogy of the urn like humanity is pulling um marbles balls out of an urn like every time it plucks a new technology up and like oh we just we just figured out the wheel we just figured out you know the Industrial Revolution and like oh you know atomic bombs most Technologies are like white right and that like they they don't have the capacity to destroy humanity and aren't widely distributed but every once in a while we pull out something that is like a black ball and we don't know what we're going to pull out because we're just so focused on getting as many things out as possible right right and so we already have this with nuclear proliferation thank God people can't build nukes and like as Nick Bostrom says by baking sand in a microwave by putting sand in a microwave right it's not it takes a lot it takes nation-state level ability to to do a nuke and even that David we've got the us we've got Russia I was just reading this morning that that China is set to quadruple it's nuclear Arsenal by uh 2035 right that's great new like China's always been there but like another new power and they all have like guns at each other's heads and then we've been talking so much about AI alignment and not just Ellie iskowski but you know people like I think backless listeners will hear on Monday Paul Christiana were like very reason working AI safety trying to make sure AI doesn't kill us and yet he gives our odds like I mean maybe 50 50 kind of a dice roll and whether we get this thing right or not and there's a very real chance that we get it wrong and it goes back to the Elisa yukowski thing and then we've got like The Meta crisis and you know the big enemy of ethereum and cryptos we've and the big enemy of bankless is really like these moloch traps uh you were talking about coordination earlier it's like when we get in this discordinated mode when we have these game theoretical failures where we get in arms races and um we're all doing the thing that we don't want to do but we have to because we're just on this this moloch trap this treadmill that kind of makes us all invest in nuclear weapons for example nobody can stop um that's like man how do these are very thorny problems to solve and they keep getting more and more thorny as we get increased power in higher technology so I'm just like I don't know maybe I'm just in a mood but I'm just like I kind of like this whole Humanity thing like I kind of there's people in my life that I like I love very much it's good here like this this whole Modern Life but we are living in this man Modern Life Is So Great in so many ways and yet we have this sort of Damocles over our heads like a madman can just end it end it all completely with like not very much effort and that could happen at any time it's just a bizarre existence so I think again I go in these like fits and starts with this where sometimes I'll be thinking about this and then I'll just be well whatever I'll get busy so this is I'm like I'm almost like okay well what do I do about this so I know this information but I've known this kind of information more generally before so what do you do you like distract yourself like just plug into work and not think about it um do you like do are you aware of it in the background but you just treasure the moments that you have is that the strategy for for coping with this do you just like I you know I think we're doing this on a debrief one time just laugh at the absurdity like it is so freaking ridiculous that we have to live like this right and yet that is the fact so what do you do just do the throw up your hands and just laugh about it exactly so but at the end of the day all of these are coping mechanisms I'm just like why can't we just solve this wouldn't it be great if and so I'm bullish on crypto but it's everything else that I'm feeling not bullish about this week right do you know what I mean yeah I'm just I guess I'm in a mood but um I couldn't find a thing where I was like hey I am so excited about this because that's what I've been thinking about I feel you um it's it's what there's one line you said at the uh when we were talking about uh I think maybe it's at the end of the uh Paul Christiano episode or maybe it was I can't remember when it was something about like hey why is Bank why are we doing AI content and you were and you did we joke jokingly absurdly said like well we need to solve the AI alignment thing so that so crypto so crypto so crypto goes up so crypto goes up because like if AIS come then we we just hand over our exactly our blockchain technology to them and they take it from us and so like it's one of these things where like you and I are just like these intrinsically curious people who find important things that we think that we are really important to uh to talk about and at very least educate and broadcast and so like the only thing I have to tell you dude is like all we've got is this podcast and this newsletter and this company and if it's if this is concerning to you humans derive purpose from solving problems and I think we actually did a uh We've solved a lot of the problems that we set out at bank list two solve uh there's still a lot more work that crypto has to do but it feels like it would get there anyways at this point in time and it didn't crypto didn't feel like that uh when we first started bankless there's another problem out there in which you're labeling like uh AI alignment uh the democratization of destructive Technologies uh that we is a new problem and I don't think you and I neither of us signed up to solve that problem when we started Bank this but it's intellectually simulating um it pays the bills it's fun to talk about and so I suggest that we put One Foot In Front Of Another and make podcasts about it well there's time left we just make all this time left I mean look I guess what you're saying is what more can we do right that's the thing we just got our little slice and I think that's maybe I don't know if look I don't know if that was helpful bankless listener or if it brought you down I didn't mean to bring you guys down I didn't mean to you know kill the mood here but like I guess what I would say is what I was just hearing from you David is all you can do is your part your one small part to like making the world a better place solving some of these problems being there you know for for the people you love in your life that's the small part you could take and I think where I fall into a trap is when I think about all of the problems that need to be solved all at once and then I get overwhelmed and that's a that's kind of a failure mode for me personally but when I when I bring it down to like kind of the daily okay what are you gonna do about this today what are you going to do about all this stuff tomorrow that's where I start to get out of that uh that failing Road cycle there you go hey bankless in therapy thank you David for that little session let's talk about the meme of the week this is fantastic what are we looking at right here this is uh the first just mic drop meme from our new designer uh crypto Wars bankless edition so uh if you you must be watching the YouTube for this to make sense uh but this is what is
