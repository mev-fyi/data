[Music] hi everyone this is d5 dad and this is another bankless tutorial so today i'm going to show you how to use this new tool called hal it refers to 2001 a space odyssey the the computer hal so i thought that was really clever but this is a tool that can be used with defy applications it is not built on a d5 protocol but it is intended to be a tool that allows you to automate notifications uh related to different ethereum applications so you'll notice there's quite a few here and they have what are referred to as recipes which you can message them if you've got ideas for different recipes but if we take a look at the maker recipe you can be notified about the collateralization ratio you have if you've got a vault or a loan open with maker so if i click here i could put in my my wallet address that's holding that that vault or loan and then i can be notified by email discord slack telegram twitter or anything that can use a web hook some of the other defy applications that you can automate notifications for are synthetics you can do that with the collateralization ratio if you're staking with synthetics i'm going to show you how to automate getting notifications about gas prices using this chain link option with loop ring they've got a withdrawal notification programmed in let's see what they've got with compound you can track oh that's cool you can track supply and borrow rates so that would be very helpful so you could decide that i want to track the lending rate supply rate for let's say let's pretend i'm looking for an opportunity to lend an asset that i have in my wallet so that i can earn comp and let's say that i'm holding tether then i can be notified if uh the lending or supply rate for tether which is currently at 1.77 percent i can be notified if it's less than equal to or greater than let's say five percent and then again i just punch in whichever one of these just flip the little switch and i can put in my my email address or discord and so on let's see we also have ave with a few different recipes there pull together i thought this was really cool you can be notified of the winner that's something as someone who holds pull together tickets i have to go to the website and actually check it and i think it gets updated at 3 pm eastern every friday but this would allow me just to receive an automated notification of whether or not i have won gas prices are really high right now uh and because they're so high it would make sense that i might need a notification when gas prices are lower maybe i'm waiting on putting through a transaction until the gas price is lower so that i can save money on transaction fees so if i go to the home page at 9000.hal dot xyz discover i'm gonna scroll down to chain link i'm gonna click on the explore recipes click use recipe and then here's where i can decide if i wanna be notified when the gas price is less than equal to or greater than uh whatever value is this so right now the gas price is 62 gway actually if we update this let's see what it is okay so it's 62 gway if i want to put through a transaction instantly so in this case let's see if i can set this so that if the current gas price is less than 50 then i'd like to be notified another thing i could do other than just you know using one of these channels here like email or slack is i could actually incorporate this into a discord server so if i'm running a community of folks that are enthusiastic about defy all i have to do is flip the switch here scroll down a bit and i need the discord web hook url so where i'm going to go for that is click on uh click on discord i go to the server settings and then under web hooks you're going to create a web hook and this is what it ultimately looks like so you can name whatever the bot is you choose what channel in your discord server and then this is the actual web hook here so i'm just going to copy this go back to this paste it in i can now actually test it to make sure it's working so i'll click post a test message and there we go right there there's my my test message and if i hit create what i will have to do is sign up with either google or github so again this is not a decentralized application i'm not going to actually sign in with like my meta mask this is a tool where you do have to give up some sort of identification to use it okay that's all i've got for you today if you have any questions feel free to reach out to us in the bankless discord channel you can also comment on our tweets as well as the actual video which will be posted in the bankless youtube channel under bankless tutorials and don't forget to hit subscribe that'll keep you up to date on any future new uh bankless tutorials i post as well as the bankless podcast and the bankless state of the nation uh show which ryan and david are doing uh i believe every few days now so anyways thanks so much for watching [Music] you
