what advice do you have for our industry when the whole industry understand that the SEC is not really here to advocate for our assets we're in a bad place right SEC is lashing out by bringing lots of enforcement actions I'm trying to push from inside for us to have more productive conversations with the industry but I think that needs to come also from people who use crypto people who are trying legitimately to build things within crypto just say you know what we're just not even going to go and talk to The Regulators in DC then what is DC left with we're left with stories of really bad things happening in crypto where the conclusion then becomes well this is just a lawless group of people they're not interested in complying and so why should we waste time with doing anything other than bringing enforcement something worse will fill the void is what you're saying I fear that's the case that's something that we can continue to work on
