[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today on the show i have two very special guests i have the co-founders of feature a web3 studio that's powering creators and brands and the future of entertainment you all know i love to talk about ip and entertainment and the metaverse and nfts so that is what today's topic will be about we have uh stephen hmm did i did i screw up that pronunciation my friend nope oh i did it right yeah okay you've worked with big names stan lee kanye west i mean you've got a a long history impressive history in the entertainment space also with me dennis al shuler did i get your last name right dennis too am i two for two here yeah damn i'm on roll dennis is an entrepreneur he was on the finance team at truecar former vp of strategy and business development at zip recruiter worked with multiple startups and now of course is the co-founder at feature hi carly great to be here awesome all right before we dive in we're gonna we're you guys caught my attention because you are the marketplace that's powering this coinbase casting situation coinbase is casting apes in a three-part trilogy they are producing and y'all are part of the engine that's powering that i really want to talk about how that came together and what you think this means for the future of the space as well as just broadly about hollywood and as an industry and how nfts may be disrupting it but before we get into all that good stuff we need to hear a word from our wonderful sponsors if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge

both of you dennis steven really appreciate y'all hopping on here thanks for having us uh okay i i said this earlier your platform you've launched a licensing marketplace essentially and i want you guys to really clarify what this is um but i came across it partly through our friend john rogers and partly because it's being used by coinbase right now coinbase is producing a three-part trilogy they are casting board apes and also world of women do i have that or is it just apes that they're casting just sport apes and maybe some other projects in the future okay and maybe some other products in the future in this film and they are using your licensing marketplace to connect with board ape holders who want to license their ape to coinbase did i get that right do you want to give your uh description of what's going on here dennis maybe we'll start with you yeah absolutely yeah we partnered with coinbase and the team and their agency invisible north to provide the technology that would allow uh board ape holders to submit their apes through a casting call and through our technology to be in the film and so what that means is the technology that we provided uh verifies that they own the ape within the wallet that that they have and that they create get to create a name and a backstory for for their ape and then submit that through our uh technology to coinbase coinbase then went and selected the winners that they wanted to and then we uh took those licensing agreements put them on chain and minted them on chain and created two different licensing uh agreements tied to nfts that one goes to the licensee which would be coinbase and one goes to the license or which would be uh the ape holder that was selected and how many apes were were selected uh they selected seven winners to start okay and and i believe it was 10k was the was what they were offering so that was up front you knew ten thousand dollars if your ape was cast in this film that's right ten thousand in either uh apecoin or bitcoin it seemed to me like i i saw some uh debate happening within the ape community some people feeling like ten thousand dollars was a great deal to get for your ape which was my first reaction i saw this and i was like oh my god this is so game-changing this is just the next level of owning nfts and what it means to be an nft holder and ten thousand dollars is amazing but it seemed like other people were disappointed or like my ape is worth more than ten thousand dollars uh stephen did you follow that were you kind of tracking that debate what do you what do you think it means for sort of what we're seeing here happen on a macro level well i think that on a macro level it's the first time that this kind of transaction is happening for people and they're unsure about you know what does that mean what are the terms and really there's an educational component that's part of this conversation and i think it's healthy debate and sometimes just people think that their apes are worth more than that to appear in a in a trilogy so it was i think that the conversation is healthy though you talk about putting the licensing on chain sort of after the fact that the can you explain sort of how you've gone about thinking about on chain off chain throughout this process maybe get a little bit more in the weeds on that yeah i i mean for for me it's very important i think for feature we're always trying to think in a web 3 native way especially with blockchain being really i would say a foundational level of of a system to allow for transactions to take place and so as much of the process that would be traditionally off chain to be able to bring that on chain with the transparency and the security is really a tenant of what feature is trying to accomplish here and i think that establishing those rails and systems will allow for more transaction volume to occur within the ip licensing uh you know market so specifically when you talk about what historically would have been done off chain and now it's on chain is this an automated payment process you know you've got a smart contract now that will enforce the terms of this agreement where the ten thousand dollars will automatically show up once a triggering event occurs whereas previously it would have been a more manual like okay it's happened now we've got lawyers that'll enforce this process and make sure it goes through rather than than an algorithm is that specifically what you're talking about uh i think it's the payment is one part of that um it's engaging in selecting the intellectual property that you want to acquire on chain and then the execution of that contract whether that's through docusign or just through acquiring it automatically so using the payment as a what as equal to a wet signature and so really automating that process of accepting the deal and transferring the money and we believe that those can work in tandem as opposed to traditionally you would be like okay we agree on the terms we sign a contract and the check is in the mail or the wire will be coming and then yeah and then you're again you're relying on your legal team or whatever like that that's your recourse if it's not actually if it hasn't actually happened whereas here you can you can watch it happening in real time sort of on the blockchain um and that's sort of those broader rails are there is there more to those broader rails that you're excited about setting up steven that you were referencing earlier uh yeah i think on a very uh you know on a high level here if we think about the traditional um licensing process it's so antiquated right we're taking an abstract concept of something like life rights or even just uh commercial rights and then you're really creating a legal framework on a paper document that establishes the rules of how that transaction will work and really it's where it's enforceable right what what district will you go to court to you know mediate the issue and we think that that process is essentially low-level programming and if you can bring that process to the blockchain into the smart contract that really provides the rails and systems for higher volume transactions to occur with intellectual property that has become essentially descent which has become decentralized when you talk about higher volumes occurring maybe this is obvious but i just want to make it explicit it's like if you can streamline this process essentially get the lawyers out of the picture the expense of lawyers out of a out of the picture the grayness around you know will if somebody licenses my ip for example will i properly be paid for all the use cases they're using it for like do i need to go track all of those use cases down all of that that's embedded in the system as it exists today getting rid of that inevitably must create just higher volume because you you've just gotten rid of so much friction is that what you mean um i think the difference here is that you still need lawyers right what are what are what it was the actual deal and we we think there's a level of standardization that can come can come out of this um and that's part of the evolution of uh the people who hold the ip understanding more about what intellectual property actually means but also in terms of creating a framework and an essential yes through that process of streamlining the offering the negotiation process even and the ability to buy on with one click and leveraging uh wallets as the form of wet signature you can streamline that process and ultimately increase volume in something that was a really antiquated system dennis let me ask you on this negotiation piece one argument i've heard is platforms like yours will be important or or maybe have a really important role to play in this future where everybody's a a stage mom because we all hold nfts that are getting cast in things um because you do have an individual if i'm an individual ape holder i'm certainly at a disadvantage negotiating against coinbase who have lawyers and expertise and access to whatever they want and resources do you see your role in this partly as helping to get fair terms for the nft holder as they negotiate with people with a lot more experience and resources yeah absolutely i mean i think the what we're trying to do is set up the system as steven said where it is standardized and so there's that that trust in the system that will allow for more transactions to to to happen but there are going to be cases where we're going to need custom contracts and you know lots of brands today are still requiring you know their own custom contracts and custom paper so the thought is how do we create that structure so in the early days that the brands and companies can get uh comfort that they're protected by using their paper and some standardized terms and then we can set up a system so that uh a lot of these new kind of license holders and new uh you know new people to the space can be educated on what on what it means how the terms work uh etc and so as we start to you know build our smart contract out more we think there's an opportunity to convert more and more of a standard contract into uh features and functionality of a smart contract on the blockchain and so one example of that is you know if you own an ape and you enter a license contract what happens to excuse me and you sell that eight to somebody else right what happens to those licenses well we've built in the solution now that that that those licenses basically follow the eight and will transfer right so there's new ways to create functionality into the smart contracts that were covered in maybe a different way with traditional contracts i'm i'm processing this in real time so if that license that belongs to my ape and i now sell my ape to steven the licensing rights transferring do we know the licensing rights are going to be standard because of what yoga labs has outlined or like i may want to apply different rights to my ape than stephen might and he'd have to go in and then change those now that he's the ape holder well these are rights and licenses that were already basically completed right that are that are you know are live universal yeah that are universal but that are in effect like the contract is in effect right so but if we want us if you want to sell your rape to stephen then what happens to those agreements right that that you have oh oh i'm catching up i'm a little slow today i've been uh i've been running on little sleep so so licenses in terms of if i was getting some sort of recurring revenue for example for my ape and i was on a recurring basis coinbase was paying me out a thousand dollars a month instead of one ten thousand dollar lump sum and then my ape gets sold to you that recurring revenue would now transfer to you as the new owner rather than me as the old owner that's really what it's about that's right and so we talk about this this transferability of the of the licenses which is which is important and we've built that into our technology today the you know an interesting point about the the the royalty piece is we think that's in the future because right now most uh most you know revenue associated with uh with licenses is off chain so there's a whole report there if we were to do royalties tied to that there'd be a whole off chain uh you know reporting requirement which we we think today is a little bit too tough to to implement so that's why we've set it up where the lights the licenses are sold for an upfront amount and that's standardized but think about in the future where a lot of these licenses could enable could be where the revenue is coming from other metaverses other marketplaces other solutions where it is we are able to track those royalties and those transaction values on chain and then in though in that scenario we would be able to set up the royalties tied to to licenses so this is kind of a first step of getting these licenses on chain and then build these uh mechanisms as the as the ecosystem develops this is so exciting to me because this is the tooling that we need to unlock a lot across a number of industries i interviewed m shadows who's the front man of avenge seven fold and one of the the sort of aha moments i've been having is just realizing over and over again how a lot of what's holding us back is like our legal infrastructure or antiquated structures that have contracts in place that can't just be unwound so like the music industry we're a little ways away from fulfilling our web three dreams the music industry just because of the way all the contracts are you know everything's already been written but down the line something like this for new artists having smart contracts where your fans could automatically get royalties based on plays on your song that that sort of recurring revenue royalty licensing like i think this unlocks so much steven i'd love to hear from you specifically when it comes to like licensing out your nft to be used in commercials or tv or film how big is this opportunity do you think really like is this going to become super commonplace or will this be you know an awesome and powerful niche thing that happens that's a big question um well i think what's interesting about nfts is that they come they cross over into so many different markets right you have the traditional merchandising component which is massive for intellectual property and then you have the content side or the media side which is obviously big and so because of those synergies and now you've decentralized the intellectual property to allow somebody to hold those rights i think that we're going to unlock a lot of opportunities that cross over between um those two sectors and so it's hard at this vantage point to really you know take it all in but i can see the opportunity now because it's being unlocked and you have these systems for brands and and uh companies and even just rights holders people that want to go collect a bunch of great rights that are existing coming out of web3 early on maybe with the foresight of saying i can leverage these as an ip library down the road i think there's going to be a lot of opportunity that's going to come out of this and from our initial conversations with people in the brand space or merchandising or even the media space you know the media side hollywood and television are sorry um film and television are obviously looking at web3 they see original ip quickly accelerating to establish ip there's real metrics there's real community here so everyone's trying to figure out in a way how do we get involved and within our own model and then you have the other side which is like the brands and the companies and also these merchandisers who are saying we want to play in that space as well so we find ourselves exactly in this middle position where we can leverage the intellectual property in a way that creates structure to allow both parties to uh interact in this space so i think that this is just the beginning and i do think it will be very lucrative as you start to get into microtransactions as well where for example if i am a owner of a virtual cause sculpture i can license that out to a virtual event for 24 hours and now you can have a cause sculpture in your metaverse experience and people get to experience it and automatically those rights revert at the end of the 24 hour period and then somebody gets that little micro transaction and so as we start to get more interoperability between our assets which is another part that i think is important to talk about licensing in conjunction with assets and how those unlock we're going to start to see a lot of these micro transactions and macro transactions as well i i want to maybe ask you then to unpack a little bit more of that licensing and assets connection that you you seem to be hinting at but let me let me start with this because i think a fun thought experiment i had that'll lead to a question that as i was thinking about this is like brands wanting to reach a certain demographic and the forthcoming data that we'll eventually have in probably really streamlined ways about okay a dead fellas holder is likely to be xyz demographically now you know this is a more anonymous space so whatever whatever but i think we will have a lot of that information or a world of women holder typically looks like this or you know board a but on and on and now i'm a brand that wants to connect with or communicate to a particular demographic suddenly i want to go cast a dead fella because i'm trying to reach that audience so it's not just how much existing interest is there in this right now but also as everything about this space evolves how will this be how will brands will interact with us in a new way do you think there's a world where in the future brands are like yeah i'm gonna cast a dead fella instead of casting gwyneth paltrow or whatever right there's some huge nft brand they're like there's more eyeballs or more more really die-hard engaged people interested in this nft so we're gonna cast this for our commercial rather than xyz celebrity like is that the future you see here really to either of you stephen or dennis uh i do believe that there will be nfts that become you know uh celebrities in their own right we're we're moving from a uh we're moving into a digital era where we interact with game characters you know mario from super mario brothers is so identifiable that you can imagine that there will be projects and specific characters that people build massive brands around and use that as their identity and leverage it in many sorts of licensing opportunities so i do believe that there will be some standouts that come out of this and that's really through the efforts of how the ip holders treat that that avatar um and you know you're starting to see it as i said through gaming and and people um identifying behind an avatar as opposed to being themselves like themselves right yeah it almost feeling to them like a better reflection of who they feel their identity is than you know whatever they they their alternatives are um do you want to speak a little bit more about licensing and assets and what you were getting at when you said that was maybe an important conversation to discuss what that looks like well so you know you have this that the base transaction layer of like i'm going to license this um the representation of my character to this other party but with nfts what i think is really exciting is an embedding into the smart contract the ability to unlock master assets without having to send them out typically what you see in a lot of these projects are somebody will say well we're going to give you the 3d asset in conjunction with your pfp which is a 2d image but now you're giving out that master asset that somebody has to now administer right so if you're going into another metaverse experience you have to figure out how do i load that avatar into that process but what we see and what i really believe is the future is that you have that master nft and you go into a metaverse experience that will unlock the ability to have you be that avatar without ever having to touch the master asset and then now you have your 2d pfp you've got your 3d and that interop ability that will come out of being able to jump into different metaverses and look at your digital identity through your wallet and go these are your options right that you can pick from your you know for your avatar or what whatever those experiences will end up being that's just very much on the surface at this point let's turn to feature as a whole y'all's company this licensing marketplace which i think is really exciting and and unlocks a lot it's just one piece of of what this overall vision is dennis can you give folks a sense of of what feature is holistically sure absolutely we're coming at it that feature is a web 3 studio that partners with the biggest creators the biggest brands in in the world and then leverages that across meta digital and traditional media spaces and so huxley is our kind of is our kind of initial tent pole case study project that we've that we've launched with a digital artist ben morrow and that has been wildly successful building a community launching his art his six issue comic book uh to the world building a community and so we think that is kind of just a jumping off point about what is possible with within the new web3 world within this new uh media ecosystem and uh you know the possibilities are endless so we'll we'll talk more about huxley but stephen stepping even further back like i think there's there's still debate around nfts and blockchain and and hollywood and there was actually recently an article that john sent me i think he said he had sent it to you guys too and the ankler from the entertainment strategy guy who i guess has a big following and he was sort of very dismissive of the potential for nfts disrupting hollywood and he compared it to 3d printing and he was like this is basically just like merchandise and it's not that big and who cares i i don't think you guys agree with that so i want to ask you what is like what is your big theory of the case as to what nfts and the blockchain really represent or can be in the world of entertainment you know technology has always influenced art and vice versa right and what i think people are are are not um bringing into the equation is that people are digesting content in new ways right if you look at um post or even during the pandemic but really post-pandemic it really changed i think the studio started realizing that they can be much more direct with their consumers right and being able to have that the ability to launch a massive blockbuster film direct into someone's home is really uh what's changed the landscape and then now you know the way that people interact with content but also in their own lives like people are watching streaming content they're talking on their phone with their friends right and people are also even in discord engaging in a community simultaneously and so i look at the future of entertainment to be really cross-platform and how do we engage the younger generation as well in the way that they're digesting content there's such a sense of community around gaming and um even you know they'll be watching a tv show but they'll be talking with their friends on their mobile and i think that's the way that i'm trying to frame uh and leverage web 3 which already has that built-in community and sense of ownership and deconstruct from their narrative so you're building the emotional connection to these characters and the narrative but you're using multi-platform to engage them and including ownership into that equation and identity and now i think you've got the sweet spot and i think a lot of people don't even talk about that because not a lot of people are thinking about it in that way they're just looking at it like how are nft is going to disrupt hollywood and it's a very one-dimensional sense of like well we're going to go raise money for a film like that's kickstarter right yeah i want to build on what you just said uh i had i had a long conversation with with john rogers yesterday he's been on the show multiple times again he's our mutual friend and um and i want to very much make sure i do not get credit for what i'm about to say because this is quite literally me parroting from him directly um but he was raising with me this concept of like architectural innovation like these things that are architectural innovations have you heard this term or is he mention this to you specifically okay so this is basically like they're it's an innovation that comes along or a business strategic concept that comes along that requires these big companies that are succeeding at something to fundamentally restructure how they're doing that thing in order to compete at the top in the new world so you mentioned like blockbuster movies so he gave that example of like there was this restructuring that happened in the 1970s when or i think it was the 70s when film studios suddenly realized that instead of just releasing a bunch of movies through the year they could actually make more money by putting a bunch of resources into releasing one massive blockbuster or a couple massive blockbusters in the summer and the revenue they would make on that would sustain them for the rest of the year and that was like a real strategic business shift that they underwent and you've had a couple of those streaming obviously being a huge one where consumer behavior is either tapping into an existing consumer behavior or there's a consumer behavior shift that requires a shift in strategy and i i hear that i feel like that's what you're saying here is like consumer behaviors especially among the younger generation are changing and they're they expect much more engagement they expect to be on three platforms at once they want to be talking to the creator of a show while they watch it or playing that game while it plays like there's an interconnectivity here that they expect um that is an opportunity for the entertainment industry folks who see that and tap into it i guess like your reaction to that does that feel right would you change anything about how you guys are thinking about it um maybe steven just respond to that i think you're dead on it's a this is a fundamental paradigm shift right uh the blockchain for me is public infrastructure that has now leveled the playing field and because of the democratization of the ability to make content as you can see with youtube and all of these platforms you have so many content creators we're used to engaging in all of these different platforms and if you think about twitter i always make the analogy like twitter is the lobby to the metaverse right it's a place that you can write a bunch of content it goes out into the world and you can go back and forth but like as we all start to go into come out of the the ice age of the digital revolution and really head into what will be the metaverse these platforms will start to merge together and so will the content and you're seeing that from the traditional space in hollywood where there's this marriage between gaming as well with real-time technologies and also traditional filmmaking um and so it's only in it it's only a matter of time before we start experiencing that content across all platforms and and john and i joke about trans media being like a a word that we had talked about for a long time and you know the early 2000s and on but really we are at the forefront of that now and we really can engage um you know community and consumers so to speak uh across these platforms in new ways living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto it's increasingly obvious that everything will become tokenized and nft marketplaces needs robust financial reporting performance analysis

automate complex reporting workflows visit gilded dot finance bank list to learn more dennis i'm curious you come from an entrepreneurial finance background that as far as i know hasn't really touched hollywood or entertainment specifically why did you want to dive in on this what has excited you about this opportunity yeah well after an investment banking background i wanted to get into tech right because that's where you know i all the interesting things were happening in the early 2010s and so jumping in at truecar and going through a great rise there but uh before they went public was a learning experience and then building zip recruiter from uh you know a small business to 1200 employees and hundreds of millions of dollars was a great uh was a great experience helping small business is higher right which is a pain point so as i think about what i wanted to to do in kind of this new uh this new age steve and i have been kicking around ideas for a number of years and started to kind of zero in on the blockchain and entertainment applications kind of the beginning the beginning of last year i don't think many many people or companies were focused on that and so that's where we we started kind of zeroing in on how can we help artists how can we help creators with this uh with this new medium and how we can start to build you know solutions uh for them and that's where i think what what's really interesting about it is as we talk about these overarching changes to the media the media ecosystem um you know it really comes down to you know a few things right having a direct relationship with your customers right i i laugh that hbo for uh you know most of their existence never had a relationship with the customer right and now that's changed through streaming right where they've had to actually you know take credit cards and deliver a product uh and work with customers web three is very much focused on directly you know working with uh the community and building the community and giving them a sense of of ownership and engagement and as we started digging into this you see that these communities are are are just uh amazing sources of of inspiration and uh love and admiration it's very positive um uh environment to be working in and we've seen this a lot with huxley and we're we're really proud of the the community that we fostered and the the friends that we've made and the uh the experiences that that we've been through in just a short the short period of time and this is the type of engagement that you you don't usually get in you know working at companies and being this close to your customer and you're you know they're truly partners in in what we're doing and it's a fun it's exciting space and the the feedback loop is is really interesting when we're on discord like when we're launching something you know our fans and and customers and partner they're they're they're telling us what's what's going on how they're how they're feeling if they're enjoying it and that could be really stressful but it's also really uh really exciting and i think we're just at the beginning of how a lot of this is playing out this is like the you know experimentation phase but the the bar keeps getting uh set higher more and more experienced teams keep coming into the space keep keep launching i think everyone's collective ambition in this space it is getting bigger you see what happened happened in the last few weeks with proof and what's upcoming with um yugo labs and i mean these are going to be defining moments in in the the web3 uh ecosystem you see with coinbase coming in uh with their uh nft marketplace uh uh launch right like the talent the energy that's coming into the space is just is just awe inspiring and and that's a little bit of what what steven and i really like about this space and why we enjoy building here let's let's take a beat on huxley now since we we haven't fully deep dived on it uh i think you mentioned this this is a a project whose creator is really ben morrow is that i have that name pronunciation right this is just the day of me not having pre-checked my pronunciations before we got on this call the theme of this episode um and you had the huxley genesis token which i know nobody we don't want to hyper focus on floor price but i think is sitting just under three eth right now um after i'm sure a launch that was much less expensive than that so it had some growth there congratulations and then uh you've released he's released has it been six comic books so far that ben has released as part of this huxley drop and and how does the genesis token tie into that maybe stephen if you want to just create provide some um some color around huxley along those lines so with huxley it was uh it's exciting because you know what would have traditionally been a a normal publishing deal with a graphic novel that was in six parts of a comic we wanted to bring that to web3 to leverage community and also quickly accelerate um an original ip with a kind of core community of ben and then bring that to established ip and really prove the model that you can accelerate something into hollywood that where you know that there's a real viable intellectual property and story right like that's the thing here and that's one of the big differences is a lot of people are releasing just i would say minimum viable ip right and then building in story down the line and ben had spent you know 10 years building this from the ground up and so it was really important that when we launched we not only delivered a great product for the comic books and how that tied into physicals but also it was important for us that there were tokenomics that um engaged the web3 space and so part of that structure was how do we get people to use their comics create um deflationary mechanisms to ultimately get avatars right or other components that they wanted to go further into the iep but really again coming back to there is a story here and that is the entry point and we've always stuck by that because i don't want to take you to the gift shop unless you've been on the ride so uh we built that the the tokenomics and there had been some some good case studies out there of people you know that had been exploring ways to use an nft and burning and staking and things like that but we wanted to really derive something that used the comic book to ultimately bridge you into an avatar so we created a mechanism where you had to collect five issue ones and then you would burn two to ultimately get a genesis token and the genesis token was the token that would allow you to create or you would use it to get a uh huxley robot okay i want to pause on the the line you had there because you you said a lot but i'm like that really hit me was i don't want to take you to the gift shop if you haven't been on the ride it feels like most of what's happening in this space right now in our somewhat immature stage is everyone is asking me to come to the gift shop and buy things with the promise that there's a ride i'll get to go on at some point it seems like that's intentional that's what you guys observed as being a a problem in the space is that did i get that right yeah i mean look in in you you in hollywood right you have to sell the story it's all about story if there's no story there's no there's no there there um and i spent 15 years of my life going through that process and learning what it meant to actually like deliver a story and product that people would want to buy and make movies out of um and so there's a real craft there and i think that's what's really interesting about the market right now is it's getting to a point of maturation where now people have to build so what are you building like what's your expertise has that team done that before have you built a metaverse experience before have you even touched unreal like we're at that level now and there are people with a lot of war chests that can go out there but what they don't know is that there's a shortage of creators and really good creators are really hard to get yeah um especially if there's no story okay you mentioned unreal which was the trigger word for me to to dive in with you for just a minute here because this has been something i've been wanting to look into in greater detail because i've now heard it i've heard unreal over and over again from people i've interviewed or online and my understanding of it is like it's this awesome tool that allows us to build more like realistic images and it matters for the metaverse but like i'm woefully under-informed about what unreal engine means and its significance i'm so excited you're here steven to give people a little context you know you've worked in virtual production for many years in in hollywood you worked on the polar express which was groundbreaking for its time in terms of how realistic the characters looked and how real it felt for animation so you're very uh well poised you're very qualified to speak on the evolution and the advancements we're making in terms of i don't know realism in the metaverse realism in on our screens why is unreal engine 5 a big deal why are people so excited about unreal engine well okay thank you for that there's a big question too and and i think the way to look at it is you have we have the concept of the metaverse which we're very far away from having hundreds of thousands of people in a shared space you know the ready player one kind of world and but we are not far away from our the technology providers that are out there that are building the tools and the fundamental engines to run these types of experiences and so i think a lot of people you know you have things like cyber io which are like these kind of low poly experiences that you can build start to engage community inside of them there are these pixel art based um apps that allow a bunch of people to share space there so there has been exploration of how do we get as many people as possible into a shared experience but they're in my opinion um and you know there there are very few companies that have the technical prowess and have the uh understanding that can actually build the matter what we would consider a metaverse and epic has been at the forefront of video game technologies being able to um power ip through real time and also the quality level that they're able to hit with unreal five so what we're seeing is um it you know in the matrix there was the the architect the white room where you could really load anything and i think that's the most valuable way to look at it is because you can build anything in unreal five right and that's the fun foundation of your metaverse experience and so because those tools exist they are out for free you will start to see more photo realistic gaming experiences and more photo realistic multiplayer and even film production experiences because they're looking at it as you can use our real-time technologies to impact filmmaking so for example on the mandalorian you had front uh foreground characters that were real you had environments in the front that were real and then everything in the background was done using real-time game engines and camera tracking um so they're already starting to take over the virtual the live action space and they've been a pioneer obviously in the video game side and that synergy is what is really going to start to create these different types of experiences um but also pioneering into the metaverse that is so helpful and really exciting no it totally is i i think they're i don't think i'm alone out there i think there are probably other people who have seen this term floating around and and vaguely understand that it's relevant to people who really care about how the metaverse is being built but but really didn't kind of know why one one final question speaking historically on this so epic games people probably know from fortnite they they made fortnite i heard and i'm curious if this is true that fortnite was almost really just meant to be like a test for unreal engine that like like epic has really been excited about unreal engine and that's like their core product and then fortnite it's like we have to build a game to test unreal engine and like it it had this crazy success but it almost was more a byproduct of their focus on unreal engine do you happen to know if that's true i i don't know if that's true but um yeah i i you know in any of these studios they're always trying to leverage um new mechanics and and new tools and obviously there's nothing better to do that with than ip right pixar really i think pioneered that um where they were trying to build new tool sets so they would they would say well let's do a movie with fur right so let's go do monsters inc and they would build that new sort of tool set that would be justified through the intellectual property and of course the story is great but like you're building your ip library essentially for this for the company let me ask your your goals as a company and dennis i'll ask you are you is it like we want to be the next disney this is the opportunity to dethrone these old players who aren't going to catch on fast enough oh full stop there is that the goal or is there another one you would articulate become the next disney that's a that's a big uh uh you're like we have huxley relax yeah i mean we're getting there there's there's opportunity to create the the the next disney right it's not gonna be like it's not going to look like disney it's going to be different and it's going to be um kind of leveraging new technologies it's going to be building in a different way and that's what like i think it is exciting like our goal is to build up uh portfolios of ip and experiences and by partnering with the best brands and creators in the world and so when you think about that and you think about the the you know potential financing structures and how you know the money flows and how nfts enable that and then the experiences that you can build i think that's where like the the opportunity is and so if you fast forward you know 10 years and there's uh you know 10 or 20 huxley type projects at that at that scale and bigger and now those projects are starting to mature you have a huxley movie out you have the huxley video game launched you have other projects that are starting to uh to to mature as well then that gives us a lot of you know flexibility in how we and how we grow but i think it's first and foremost is like just with like most media companies is thinking about how you engage and uh your audience and how you create different experiences and that that's what i think is really uh is really interesting y'all certainly aren't alone in in your undertaking i i've interviewed others that you know tom bilyeu is building a studio you know similar similar ambitions i would say in similar focus areas and it feels like every day i see a new new folks coming a lot out of hollywood to set up a new web 3 empower creators studio thing i'm curious how you think that that plays out and and what your impression of this landscape is right now the competitive landscape that's one question and and then the the quick follow-up to that would be do you think in a year or in some time frame we see a lot of these studios just start buying companies like yours is disney start buying these because they're like it's nike with artifact they're like god we're not gonna figure out how to build this in-house so we're gonna start acquiring players who who seem to understand it better steven do you wanna take that yeah i think that that studios will start looking at the players in the space and seeing where there's value in in really what the talent is there right it's the understanding of how the web 3 ecosystem works but also how the technologies interact and people who have a fundamental understanding of the paradigm shift and how it changes the development cycle the pre-production cycle and the production cycle and i think when you know what's what's unique about feature is we have that experience you know with dennis coming from the finance side and myself coming from uh you know the technology and overall entertainment production that we can leverage you know these assets that we're building in new ways that have a dramatic impact on the overall production cost and how the engagement and the content really flows back into the web3 ecosystem so i definitely see people you know people are coming to us already there's some partners that we can't talk about but like are very well known in the space who are leveraging our experience in bringing them into the web 3 space so we're really excited about those and i think it's just going to continue to grow and we think that with companies like epic and other large um studios that want to explore this space there's going to be a continuing growing uh interest you know the competitive landscape is an interesting question uh i'm you know i'm looking for dirt no i'm just kidding yeah no i think you know it's interesting because you have all these companies that have a big war chest but their area of expertise doesn't necessarily create the best solution to be competitive in the space because it's one thing to have money and it's one thing to know how to use that money in actual production and you can buy it but it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to push the the conversation forward and how we're digesting that content um and i think that's important here you can't just go make a movie right because it's gotta feed the web3 ecosystem too and so there's a symbiotic relationship between the what you're creating and how it ultimately impacts your community and and that's really important to understand you both have touched on in various ways recruiting and hiring and stephen you mentioned you know probably a lot of people in this space waking up one day to realize like they don't have the talent they need in the storytelling or that you know that it's hard to come by that so writers and storytellers being one area that we maybe need more of in web3 are there other hires you're trying to make right now or struggling with or other skill sets that you're like we need this and we we need some of this absolutely i mean there's you know as we think about scaling the business there's there's hiring needs in basically you know every department from engineering and solidity developers and marketing and and product and story and copy and you know across the board but i think like part of this is tied to the the natural evolution of you know kind of high growth industries right like the premise has been shown right that you can build big businesses in this space companies are you know companies are doing it right and then that kind of starts the flywheel of attracting more you know more and more talent into the uh into the ecosystem so you know that there's a big educat education piece but you know there's there's talent needs across the board for anyone that's out there thinking about getting into web3 let us know [Laughter] we're here um huxley is is your tentpole your flagship project are there others on the horizon that you can speak about share with the community on stephen you want to you're smiling which has put you in the hot seat uh any alpha you want to share here for the good viewers of overweight jpegs oh man i really wish i could we we have something that is really exciting with uh definitely the the top creators in the world um and it's a it's a it's gonna be a mind-blowing experience we're we're so excited about it's its potential and it is complex but the experience is really the apex of what we've been talking about this entire time from licensing to cross-platform engagement top technology top creators and just something that you haven't experienced before but we'll be engaged and we will definitely take you on the ride before the gift shop so okay when when when do we all get to learn more it's a big that's some big hype to drop without any sense of a time frame uh dennis when will we learn more yeah two months that's a couple years in uh in web3 time come on you're killing me uh well that's very exciting dennis i think earlier you maybe wanted to jump in on the question around competitive landscape is there something you want to add to that convo yeah i mean carly i know you're looking for dirt but like i'm mostly kidding yeah i mean i think like how i view it is like there's not like yes there's competitors and there are lots of different there's lots of different companies that are trying to grow in this space but i think what's what's special about it we're so early is that everybody is trying new things everybody else is watching those things see how they work going back refining their you know kind of product strategy and so it's a it's it's a really amazing ecosystem of everybody watching everybody else and everybody trying to kind of see what worked and what didn't and put another spin on it and try something different so it's this really you know i think unique time in the industry where um there's a lot of learning there's a lot of experimenting and generally everyone you know is positive about the you know what what uh what what everyone is doing around around growth and so i think that's just going to continue to raise the bar and continue to uh lead to new kind of you know awesome uh awesome experiences i do think writ large we're in a lovely moment in the industry which is sort of for twofold it's still early obviously we say that all the time so it's everyone's just excited to have anybody else who like recognizes this for what it is we're all like okay cool i'm not alone and i'm not crazy so like with that like that feels good and then i think um i interviewed amanda cassatt who was the cmo for consensus for a number of years and she told me something that i haven't fact checked but sounds true which is that blockchain is actually one of the only industries call it that's really growing specifically looking at the us and that some of the low interest rates we've had and that has enabled a lot of investment and vc money to flow around has masked that fact but that really blockchain is is definitely one of the sectors that's growing as fast as it is and i think that breeds like healthy competition because we all feel like the pie is growing like there's room for a lot of us and we feel that sense of growth um so obviously we all want to win and do you know whatever and but like it doesn't feel like a zero-sum game or like uh um you get that sense that there's there's room for a lot of players in this space and i think that's awesome and something i love about it yeah i mean that's right when else have you had the experience of a currency being adopted while uh a network was also being adopted at the same time and i think that's what's really interesting here is that you're having a cryptocurrency adoption people are moving into that but you're also building essentially apps onto a decentralized computer and how that flows is really interesting we i don't think we really have any models that we can compare to that at this point but that's part of the maturation of the space yeah absolutely well and the excitement of and i made this point in a recent episode that i don't know when it'll all there but it like this platform layer being something that anyone can invest in like the platform layers that were being built in the the early internet like there wasn't a way to invest in the internet per se you invested in companies and then you needed to be an accredited investor which you know like you couldn't just be an lay person getting in on the early round of facebook you can be if you have an internet connection you can get in on ethereum at the platform so that i think um also is just exciting like that there's you know there's real opportunity here without having to be like a an angel investor and and you know people make a lot of like oh the vcs are making all the money and vcs are doing very well and they're you know it's not this isn't the utopia that everyone would maybe want but it's still a hell of a lot better than than a lot of what we've seen historically okay final question future predictions i know it's it's big i don't know let's do steven where would you want to see feature it's three years from now it's a year from now what is future doing what are you uh what are you excited about i'm excited to move nfts off the computer and onto the couch that's a pr line right there that's a that's a very that's an excellent line you've got your new tagline for feature off the computer onto your couch we are featured dennis hard to top that what do you got uh not not that but uh uh i mean i think like what i really like about what we're building in the opportunity is the the the chance to rethink things and to rethink assumptions that were you know maybe conventional wisdom in hollywood where from my background is is it's 180 degrees the other way uh conventional wisdom right like the ways to create new models the ways to uh empower creators with ownership of the project in in royalties and these new kind of dynamics and new ways to shape uh business models shape how you go to market and shape the the customer experience which are which are different and new and i think that's what we're we're exploring and that's what's most exciting to me love it stephen dennis thank you both so much for coming hanging out talking about all this we didn't even really get into like breaking down the old hollywood models and what decentralization can mean on the good side of that and the bad side so you'll have to come back and we'll unpack all of that but uh we're it's a busy day for all of us so i know we gotta we gotta bounce thank you both so much thank you carly [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked this episode please go ahead and hit subscribe it helps me out it helps the show out and it means
