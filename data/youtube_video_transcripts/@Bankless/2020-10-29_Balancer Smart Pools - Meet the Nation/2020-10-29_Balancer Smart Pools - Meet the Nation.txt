unstoppable domains has two products that's helping make the crypto world feel like the old world that we're familiar with but with these new crypto economic protocols under the hood and that is human readable crypto addresses as well as uncensorable domains so i've got my unstoppable domains account open here and i've got my domains registered and so i've got davidhoffman.crypto right and i have my one of my ethereum addresses pointed to it and i'm also going to be able to add my bitcoin address here as well because this is a blockchain agnostic product any wallet that has unstoppable domains integrated will allow you to type in davidhoffman.crypto and if you're sending bitcoin or if you're sending eth or litecoin or hell even ripple it will send it to the address that i've associated on my account so i'm going to pull up my ether wallet here and i've loaded up an address with a small amount of eth and i'm going to send a little bit of eth to myself at davidhoffman.crypto it's going to populate with the ethereum address that it has but it's also linked to my twitter account because in unstoppable domains i've linked my twitter account to all of the addresses that i've plugged in and so chain link is actually associating my twitter account with my ethereum address and you know these are the web 2 platforms that we have today but think about what happens when decentralized identity becomes more of a thing i'm sure unstoppable domains is going to use decentralized identity solutions like bright id or circles to associate addresses with people in a extremely self-sovereign way unstoppable domains also allows you to spin up uncensorable websites which is i think going to become increasingly important in the world ahead of us using unstoppable domains you can purchase a website and use decentralized storage providers to host it as well meaning that no nation state can take down your website there is no cancelling in unstoppable domains world they even have templates ready to go to help you build out your first unstoppable domain so go to unstoppabledomains.com register your crypto addresses with a human readable name and maybe launch your uncensorable website today zapper is this new tool that i use to check out all of my assets in defy as you guys have known deepai has absolutely exploded recently and so managing your assets is getting harder and harder because there's so many different places and so many different assets that it could be so i'm going to put my ethereum address in here and zapper is going to tell me where all of my assets are across ethereum right so uh here are all of the assets in this wallet uh there's there's a decent amount of them and it's also going to tell me where i've deposited assets into various d5 protocols right so there's some yield farming going on there's some liquidity pooling going on we can also look more granularly at the specific protocols that it's involved with in this explore feature so it's got some assets deposited into uniswap it's got some assets deposited into balancer and also with zapper you can just exchange straight from the zapper interface right so this is just another layer on top of unit swap or other exchanges on ethereum that allow you to swap assets right so check them out at zapper.fi it'll give you a nice clean portal to invest your assets in d5 and you can also connect to multiple wallets if you use multiple wallets all at once and it'll give you an aggregate of every single wallet that you own check them out at zapper.fi also this is definitely not my wallet all right guys thanks for watching this meet the nation on the bankless youtube there's also a tactic out of the bankless newsletter that goes right alongside this so we're going to get into that in a moment at the end of that tactic is a how to mint a balancer liquidity bootstrapping pool which is the pool that we are using to resell the remaining 34 tokens of the bat zero t-shirts uh so for those that remember we minted 50 tokens and we put them in the uniswap pool and and you can redeem a token for a shirt right you take the token you burn it and then you get and then you send that transaction to apparel at banklist.com and then we send you a shirt right uh and that was great that worked out for the first 16 tokens but uniswap's pricing curve got really steep really fast and so we kind of reached a dead end where like we had 34 more tokens we wanted to give them out but no one wanted to buy them because the price went too high like naturally and so this is something that the balancer liquidity bootstrapping pools or the balancer smart pools helps solve and that's what we're talking about here in this tactic and that's what we're talking about here in this meet the nation as well today uh and so that's kind of the purpose like uh we can change the the parameters for a balancer pool and so that where where the pricing curve was too steep on unit swap we can actually smooth that out and actually make the price tick down over time uh and so we are relaunching the the bat zero token through the balancer pool today as of as of now that you are seeing this video uh and the sale goes on for 30 days and so the way that it works is it's still like uniswap where if you buy the token the price goes up but now what happens is every single day the price also ticks a little bit lower at the same time right and so oh if if no one were to purchase any tokens from the moment of initial release down to 30 days from now then the price would trend towards zero right and so we're assuming that before it actually gets to zero people will have bought all the tokens and that's how we end up with not having any tokens ourselves though the market gets to discover the fair price of the token uh and and we get to distribute all these amazing shirts out to the bankless nation and so i we get into this conversation of how these pools work with jeff from the balancer team and also definitely check out the tactic that i put out in the bankless newsletter today so thanks for tuning in let's get into it all right bankless nation we are here with jeff bennett jeff is a contributor to the balancer project you guys know balancer uh we've covered it a lot on the bank list uh in the in the bankless media department uh it's it's like uniswap but instead of two tokens it's many tokens right and and and so we actually this isn't going to be a meet the nation about balancer as a whole this is going to be a meet the nation for a specific release that balancers just coming out with that that is just now meeting meeting the world right and so uh and so for an example as to what this specific kind of balancer pool does is that uh maybe you guys remember we released the uh bap token sale for the t-shirts right and and we put them on uniswap right and then the token price on unit swap went up to a thousand dollars but then people stopped buying right because then the price was too high and so we weren't able to distribute the tokens right and people have started to use uniswap as a token distribution mechanism and this goes all the way back to like the uma token distribution uh event where they used uniswap as like their token sale right there they kind of like did a quote-unquote ico through uniswap right and then we also saw compounds when compound first issued the comp token like the this token very slowly started to trickle out into the ecosystem and so then it went on unit swap but people who didn't want to farm comp just went to uni swap to buy it but since there was so little liquidity the comp token just had was crazy volatile and there was no price discovery right and so jeff here who has been working on this specific balancer pool is working on this pool that can help solve this problem along with many other cool um cool things that can happen along with this much more expressive balancer pool so jeff thanks for coming on the meet the nation and and thanks for coming to meet the nation yeah honor to be here so so that was a little bit of a context right and so jeff maybe you can you can help me uh you know bring some even more context to uh what we're going to be talking about right and so could you go ahead and define the two uh types of balancer pools that we have today in the private and private verse public balancer pools right so these are both uh the core balancer pools that were initially launched so um and when you first create them they're they're private and in the documentation it says you know controlled uh private pool and what that is you the controller that they created from the factory has complete control over it you can do anything make any of the calls you can you can add tokens remove tokens at the swap feed and do anything you want with it but only you as the controller can add liquidity it's not open to the public and the use case for this is a couple of them uh it might be an experimental pool you're not quite ready maybe the token is not released you use any placeholder but mainly it's for institutions or custodial money managers that you're already people already trusting them with the with the money so they're the they're the custodian they're the liquidity provider no one else needs to do it that's the main use case um yeah so let's let's go over some of that so uh it's it's a we call it a private pool because you know it's what constitutes the pool is up to one specific like external address right like there's one external address that gets to determine what this pool does right and it's private in the sense that only one address can add liquidity to this pool and the reason for this is is multi-faceted but i think one of the big reasons is that because we don't want to open up these private pools to anyone to add liquidity to because we are trusting one specific address to to manage it right and so if you added liquidity to this private pool that still gives complete control over this pool to a single address and say you deposited all your ether and your usdc well this person that has complete control over this pool could mint some random erc20 and since they have control over it they could approve this random erc20 that they just minted to be part of the balancer pool and then they could drain the funds of anyone else who supplied liquidity right so while a pool is in this private state the balancer protocol doesn't allow anyone else to supply liquidity which is partly protections um but also that you you did mention that does have this extra benefit of flexibility for you know institutions or people that just want more control of what a pool is but also importantly it still enables people to use that pool to trade right and so externally people can swap ether through usdc using this pool they just can't supply liquidity did i get all of that correct yeah it's really analogous to in the traditional finance world it would be like fidelity a fidelity fund a random person can't deposit liquidity into the fidelity fund right but anybody can trade it so people have a legal you know established relationship with fidelity and then that's why fidelity is the only one that creates equity for their own fund that's right yeah you're trusting them you you have to already trust it's okay to trust the controller because you're already trusting them there's probably a legal relationship established or something like that right and i think i think one of the original visions of balancer was like this inside out like etf right where there is this uh it's a this index where anybody can trade it through and if you hold your assets in there you get the exchange fees um but in this particular way this the etf is completely uh controlled by some like top down authority that wants the etf to like be of a certain composition right right instead of sending it off to a custodian and a constitutional and paying fees to have it managed it's non-custodial you still have your funds and you're actually earning fees so it's kind of yeah it's etf on its head so uh listeners and readers of the bankless podcast newsletter uh that maybe they've they've read my my article the defy trust spectrum which we've talked about on the bankless podcast uh and there i have this graphic of like there's a robot on one end and a human on the other end and then there's also this middle ground right and what we're talking about right now is the completely human trusted end of the spectrum right like total human control total human trust not necessarily the the trustless crypto economic revolution that we're signing up for but also still really cool regardless in its own right right and so the other side of the spectrum is what you guys call like the public or finalized pools right so yes jeff can you take us there right so if you do you uh you call finalize on a private pool and it transitions it's a one-way transition once you do that there's no going back and and that fixes all the parameters whatever they are at that moment they can never be changed and it's on the interface it's called public so if you look at the exchange interface they'll be private pools and public pools and so that's just that's completely locked down and then it's safe because then you know that they never can change the swap fee they can't add anything like all you can do on that is swap right yeah okay and so then when this uh pool gets finalized we're now okay with uh allowing people to add liquidity right because now we're no longer trusting a human because what they just did is they burned their they burned their admin rights essentially right and so they there's a balancer pool a private balancer pool in a particular state and then when the when the admin of this burns their admin rights it can go to a public pool because we know the risks are basically gone right like no one can add a erc20 that they randomly minted no one can you know run pull liquidity no one can change fees on on you and so this starts to look like you know something much more robotic right something that we like we we don't trust humans we trust robots in the in the defy world and so this now makes a a particular balancer pool completely robotic and completely trustless right that's the whole idea behind behind these right to get money out of it to remove liquidity you have to supply the tokens you minted so you can't you can't get out more than you put in right there's no way there's no way to drain the pool even the controller can get out their own liquidity but it doesn't touch anyone else's because they need to admit they need to burn their tokens to get it get it out right okay and and so these public pools are largely probably the what whoever's listening to this whoever's watching this on youtube uh that the public polls are probably what they know of as balancer right like when they go to the bouncer website like you're probably looking at public pools right unless you are using a very specific niche use case of balancer for like the institutional side the the more of like the retail uh and open side of bouncers public pools like public pools are kind of what people know of as balancer is that right i mean if they're looking at the pool interface if you're looking at the swap interface you can't even tell it doesn't sure right it doesn't matter because all these things are just you know there's you can swap on them most people are probably going to the swap interface and you don't even see the pools you just you're just swapping token pairs right before we go into uh the meat of this episode which is uh you know talking about the middle ground between these two ends of the spectrum let's talk about that swap interface really quick right and so one of the best uh products from balancer is that it can obfuscate like all of these pools in the background right and so uh if you just want to go eat to die uh you don't go to just the balance or eat die pool you go to all pools ever right all that that are hooked into the balance or order routing that optimizes for like exchange liquidity can you talk about that yeah that's the smart order router so it will it will find the bet you know best path through all the the highest liquidity pools to do the the swap at the lowest slippage and most favorable turns and it all core pools all that stuff is happening at the core pool level so it wouldn't matter if it's a smart pool of any kind it doesn't know about that it's just looking at the the core pool level right so this order router's like this mesh network middleware that kind of ties in every single balanced pool in existence and if it deems it appropriate to leverage the liquidity in any one of these pools in order to best suit the trader then it therefore does that right and that's how like all of these balancer pools generally stay uh in balance with each other according to price right and so like the if there is at one pool that's just ether and die and then there's another pool that's ether die uscc mkr and somebody is trading ether and die it can leverage the liquidity and balance of liquidity in both of these pools all in one trade if it deems that it's uh a suitable for the trader right and there's even some helper uh features in the pool management interface so for instance if you're up if you're a liquidity provider i mean of course they're all also that's so swappers are one user but you do have people that just want to provide liquidity that's another and they're using the whole interface and even there there's some helpers so if you if it sees you're in a pool that's you know 50 50 something and there's a 60 40 one that's that has you know a lot more liquidity it's better for you it'll suggest it'll say hey what about this because there are pool lot of pools right right right they'll probably expand on those on those kind of features uh also cool okay so that's great background of balancer so so if you guys were looking for what a background or what balancer is like that was that was more or less than what we we just ran through but balance was coming out with this brand new thing called the smart pool right and so we started talking about like private pools where uh you know everything is kind of human trusted the the uh the parameters of what a pool is are totally up for adjustment by a human actor and then we talked about pr uh public pools which are the human actor then finalizes the bouncer pool locks everything down makes things permanent and then it kind of opens it up to the public right and there's this middle ground uh which is what you've been working on jeff at balancer where like some of these parameters can still maintain some flexibility while we still can relegate trust to a computer right and so we're going to talk about that but first i want to talk about the parameters that are open to adjustment right and uh i believe there are six of them and so going through them really quickly and then we'll spend some more time on them the six parameters that make a balancer pool a balancer pool are like the fee size the token weights uh the ability to add um add or remove tokens from a balancer pool uh and then the tokens themselves that are approved in that balancer pool and then also the total amount of value in the pool token so like the total market cap of the pool itself and then lastly the ability to pause or enable swaps right and so uh so jeff let's go through each one starting with the the fee size right that's one of the first of six parameters and so the the fee size is just like just like unit swap is 0.3 percent right and you know balancer can be anything but with a bouncer smart pool we can there are some more conversations that we can get into where they it gets even more flexible uh so so let's start with that let's start with that right well uh so um there is uh there are limits on it there is a min and a max fee on the core pool and if you have this right enable so when you create a smart pool you're creating it with certain rights enabled and then you can only change the parameters right to that so you it it requires less trust the more rights that pool has the more trust is required right so you could make one or you were talking about surge pricing later like if you want to make the surge pricing pool maybe the only one you enable is the swap fee and everything else is off so that means the only thing that the controller can do is at the spot be nothing else and but it means they can set it arbitrarily within the limits of the core pool so a fraction of a percent up to ten percent okay actually so let's hang on that point at that point really quick so we just went through six variables that make up a balancer pool and if we were to leave all six open would that make it equivalent to a public pool well if if open means you have all the rights yes then it would be like a private one that you that's that's public yeah that would require complete trust it wouldn't make any sense nobody would do that right if you had all the rights off then it's the same as a corporal it's the same as a public pool right and so this is why we're talking about the middle ground spectrum between full human trust and full like robot you know parameters right and so what what balancer is now doing is kind of enabling that middle ground to come into existence and allow like the the greater d5 world to find you know which which parameters are really useful for them to like still have control over while everything else is locked down right so one of the one of the uh really interesting use cases that i heard fernando talk about on a podcast was and you just mentioned it like surge pricing right like what happens when uh we can start to to manipulate the fee size based on demand at a particular time right and so uh outside of covent times uh during friday nights or saturday nights you know the the local bar area for any particular city would have extremely high demand for uber right like uber and so like what uber would do would they would just jack up the price right like as demand goes up and supply stays the same price should go up and so that's what uber would do right and so with a more flexible balancer pool it's possible to have a fee that adjusts based on certain parameters right and so as there's demand for liquidity inside a balancer pool then we can adjust the the fee up and down that is uh more optimized to generate revenue for the uh liquidity providers which incentivizes more liquidity right right and yeah and you could do that out of the box now um if you had a level two if you had something uh looking at the the market and looking at the swap frequency or something and then it would just call the stat swap fee uh function it would be harder to you could do it in a contract as well if you did a subclass it would be harder because there's kind of an information problem uh right you know the the smart pool doesn't know what's happening below it in the core pool so i'm not sure the smartphone would have enough information to do it by themselves you might need an oracle or something but it could be done right so we're talking about the oracle problem right so like cool we have this smart pool that serves this particular purpose but it doesn't know when to adjust the fees and so what we could theoretically do is you could hook in the fee amount to a contract on ethereum another smart contract that gets information from like chain link or or you know some other input from elsewhere in ethereum some other contract maybe maybe we're talking about like the amount of liquidations on maker dow right like maybe that's a that's an input of data into like the the thing that sets the fee or we're talking about like the the number of exchanges that are made on the s eth pair for synthetics right like some some amount of arbitrary data that we find on ethereum we can use that data to set a parameter to adjust the fee for this particular smart pool right and this is how we can have flexibility in fees without trusting humans right and so we we only we only trust humans to write the code correctly the first time and then implement that code and then that code is now therefore the robot am i getting everything correct i think so yeah if you subclassed it then you yeah you could make a poke fees like this similar to poke weights and it would it would use all that information to set the fees but you could also do it on level two right away with the existing reference implementation so fantastic yeah so why i get really excited about this is that like this opens up the possibility of fees to be like maximally expressive right like now it's kind of it's up to your imagination and your technical capabilities to code what you think the fees should be right for your particular use case and then also you know it helps when ethereum has more data available to you and that's just a function of define needing to grow but at this point like the ball's in the developer's court to come up with the right way to design fees on their balancer pool that is suited to their needs of whatever pool they're trying to create right and we've designed it to be very flexible so that even the the reference implementation that we're releasing should be usable out of the box with just changing the settings and setting rights for a large in a variety of use cases and then if you hit something that you need to do like ample forth they have a different token that you know if you they had to subclass because the way the weights work is different the balancer pools don't expect the weights the token balances to change out from under them right so they had to do something completely different to handle their elastic supply tokens they had to synchronize the weights with their rebase so to do that they had to subclass so that's a that's a case of extending the crp so it's designed to be easily extensible also right yeah so that that hops right into the the next parameter out of the six so the first was the fee that was number one now now you kind of hopped into number two which is token weights right so so go into more detail about what ample fourth did with the the smart pool that uh is specific to the smart pool that they couldn't have done with um you know a private pool or a public pool you with me jeff jeff can hear me there we go are we back yeah oh and what happened there okay i think that was i've been having internet troubles um i'm gonna go ahead and assume that zoom was still recording uh all that initial stuff i hope we'll find out after the fact uh okay so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna i'm gonna hop unfortunately we cut off right at a nice transition point so i'm just gonna hop right back into uh what i was saying ready to go yep cool uh so yeah jeff that that actually bleeds right into the second parameter that we want to talk about so that was talking about the fees of of the six parameters we're going to talk about that fees were number one and now we're talking about token weights right that's another thing that can be adjusted in a smart pool right so talk about what ampliforth needed to do in order to have a more flexible balancer pool to suit their needs all right well yeah in that case they they had the the core reference the reference implementation couldn't handle it because they have elastic supply token so there there's always three layers here you know there's the smart uh contract the core pool and then the token contracts and they all interact that's why this is so you know can be complicated sometimes in their case their token uh is an elastic supply token which means that they had a daily rebase and there's different kinds of those but there's rebases every day so the balance of the tokens actually changes asynchronously every day and if that happened inside a balancer pool it would it would cause issues repeat trees so uh what they do is um they have a atomic operation that that synchronizes their weights with the rebase so it doesn't mess up the price it doesn't change the the price inside the balance or pool when they're token rebases right so in the same way that we were talking about how we could hook in the fee for a balancer pool to some external contract on ethereum what ample forth did is they hooked in the weights of a balancer pool to their rebasing contract right so the balancer pool that uses um or the yeah the bouncer pool that has ample fourth tokens in it it needs to know the weights right because and the weight of ample fourth in the greater ethereum ecosystem changes every 24 hours right and so we need to inform the balancer pool of that weight change so the bouncer could handle it right and so ample forth was likely never going to be in any balance or pool without this more flexible um uh weight change mechanism that's in the balancer smart pools yeah they had to actually they have their own subclass of the pool so it's not the same class as the reference implementation it's their own subclass where they've disabled the the normal or the regular reference update weight functions and replaced it with their resyncing thing that they need to do for their token and so this this changing the weights of a of a token is actually also really cool for a distribution event right uh and and so uh tell us about the the perp token and how the perp team distributed their token right that's one of the the main use cases of it and this is the problem this is exactly the problem with uh you know you just walk that you were having with with distributing back serums is uh when you can't change the weights um and you have a one kind of a one directional swap the price is just going to keep going up and you can't do anything about it so and also if there's a um interaction there's a capital requirement issue too so if you have if you want your tokens to to cost a dollar and you only have a thousand dollars to put in capital you could do it but you can you can only only sell a thousand tokens if you want to sell 100 000 tokens you need a hundred thousand dollars so to avoid that what you can do is what we call the liquidity bootstrapping pool that's where you you start out the weights where you you wait it could be as much as 98 percent and two percent that way you need a much less capital requirement in the if you have your project token and then the collateral token you can have a much lower balance of the collateral tokens so your capital requirement is lower and you can still get a reasonable price and the other thing and that was important for perp is it it allows fair distribution and also price discovery so say you think the the market value is maybe two dollars you would set it up so that it starts out at 10 and then and then uh the weights gradually flip over time so they go down over time and if no one's buying and the weights are going down that means the price is going down so it comes out at ten dollars nobody buys it goes down to nine nobody buys you know and eventually it hits five dollars and people start buying right so there's a built-in price discovery and then and then it will kind of and then the buyers will kind of throttle themselves um you know because if if they're buying with when the weights aren't changing the price goes up if they just if they wait right uh or or they buy slower than the price will go down over time right okay so this this uh to me i think is really cool and of all the features that balancer has in these smart polls i think this is going to be the one that gets leveraged the most right because you know we love you know we know that d5 loves tokens and it also loves distributing tokens and as a token distribution mechanism i don't think i've seen a more elegant uh token distribution mechanism right and so if you have a goal of getting your tokens into the wild retaining liquidity and preventing also front running which is another topic we're going to get into i think the balancer liquidity bootstrapping pools which i think is just another name for a balancer smart pool that changes the weights over time according to some rule uh that this is the way to do it right so i'm gonna share my screen so people can kind of see uh what i'm talking about and and also get really excited about it right and so this is a graphic that mike mcdonald made and so it's very it's very simple um and it just shows that you know that we have uh an example token like project token like and insert your project token here and we also have die right and so and in this particular pool uh the parameters for the weights are set to change over what looks like a six months time in this particular example right and so at the beginning uh they've minted some random erc20 like it's just some some token that they have decided to mint and it's therefore their team's project token right like well and you know any sort of like you know farm or or you know project or whatever that means a token starts off like this like it just starts off as an ert20 and it doesn't have value until they figure out how to describe value to it later but they need to get the token out in the wild right but they also don't have since their startup they also don't have a bunch of money to like market make for it or or you know have a bunch of capital to to provide liquidity and so they set the weight in the balancer pool to 80 and then they set the money whether it's ether or die they set that to 20 right and so you know it always has to has to add up to 100 right uh and but then the thing the cool thing is that over time the the the according to the balancer smart pool contract it will the weight will tick downwards as time goes on right and so this is for for those aren't that aren't familiar this is what's called a dutch auction right it's like an inverse auction where instead of like having to people bid up each other and then there's a sale the price starts really high and then it starts to move downwards right and we're assuming that if you you know start the price really high and then end the price really low at some point in the middle ground the free market will come in and buy all the tokens right except i think what's really cool about this balancer pool is that it's still integrating a uniswap like mechanism where as people buy it the price goes back up right because that's how balancer works it's an automated market maker and it prices things based off of the ratio of the tokens between each other and so while the balancer pool is waiting the project token down over time and waiting the die token up over time people are coming in and adding dye and taking out the project token right and so we actually saw this in uh the uh the the perp token distribution which what we're talking about and so let's look at some of the data here this is the actual price graph of the perp token over time and so this is totally unlike what you would see for from a token distribution event in unit swap right this is not at all what the graph chart looks like for the uma token when they did their unit swap distribution it's not what the graph looks like for the comp token it looks really fair right it looks really good it's you know it starts at you know what looks like a dollar seventy goes up to dollar eighty down to a dollar and then it kind of stays in this bound over the whole entire sale duration but what is happening in the background is as people are buying more of the tokens the balancer pool gets more and more dying and less and less tokens right and so what ended up happening is this extremely fair distribution event i have never seen a more distributed token uh chart than this particular graph right that's like absolutely insane there's like no real whales here like the biggest person owns just four percent that's crazy um and like the the transaction volume here's a graph of the transaction volume was nice and steady um uh order sizes uh and so so jeff what do what do what did you think about when you saw when you saw this crypto can get issued in this particular way yeah yeah the spikes were probably some of the big purchases but yeah it was really because you never really know you know we sort of the prediction is or that that the you that the buyers are swap you know the buyers will kind of throttle themselves according to the price and and you respect a fairly flat uh price curve and likely that's exactly what we saw so um [Music] yeah it's predictable over time and and everyone knows that it's sort of priced in absolutely and the reason why this is important is because token issuers don't want less tokens on their balance on their books and they want more cash right like that's the whole point of distributing a token and so when when me and ryan when we were distributing the bap zero token for the bankless shirts i should have worn that shirt uh we we put all all 50 tokens into uniswap and then about 20 to 25 of them got purchased but then they started to become too high highly priced right and so you know i think the shirts are really cool but i'm not ever going to blame someone for not paying a thousand dollars for a shirt right like that's kind of ridiculous right and so we kind of ran into this dead end where we couldn't sell any more shirts even though we wanted to get them out into the wild we couldn't sell anymore because uh you know like no one wanted to pay more than a thousand dollars a shirt and so what we are going to do now with help from the balancer team so so thank you jeff for for the help uh is we're going to distribute the bap tokens in this uh in this balancer pool that changes the weights over time right and so it's what's so great about it is that it retains the uniswap feature of you know if people buy then price goes up but then like but then over time the price will go down and so like if if uh we took the what this current state of the unit swap pool which is right now there's like 30 bap tokens in there they're priced about like 800 and if we put that into a balancer pool the 800 price would start ticking downwards slowly over time and we will we'll probably extend this over like a two-week period and so slowly over time like it'll go you know 800 780 760 740 700 and then something somebody will buy a token and it'll jump back up to 80 or 800 right and then and then it'll start to tick downwards over time and so everyone can achieve a fair market price for the token right and so at the end of the day the the price keeps on ticking downwards until people buy and then it goes up until there's no more tokens right and then it's in the hands of the free market and then and and thankfully bankless doesn't have any more tokens because as much as like i said as much as i like those shirts i don't want 30 of them uh and and it's just a great way to uh get a token out into the wild and not only that if you run the simulator and look at the total proceeds it also kind of maximizes revenue for the token and also minimizes because they don't want to have a lot of leftover tokens and they want to have the highest collateral possible and what achieves that is a pretty flatters even slightly increasing price curve is what is how that's achieved versus you know the price start tanking right down the bankless state the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well we're also brought to you by monolith monolith is your cool new defy account your defy savings account your default checking account except the cool thing about the monolith defy account is that it gets software updates right you actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time so here are some of the features monolith is a smart contract wallet with a lot of the features that you would expect if you've come to know defy and what it is you can you can add money to it you can put that money to work in compound and accessing yield but you can and you can also swap through uniswap what was cool with monolith is that they will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your smart monolith smart contract wallet on ethereum so it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a a savings account that gets software updates so this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world but you can still do real world things with you know real money and like buy your groceries so that's just fantastic coming soon to monolith actually already here to monolith is now you can buy die and get it sent to your wallet directly right so it's also being an on-ramp so you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like coinbase or gemini or wherever you can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account smart contract wallet so check them out at monolith.xyz right so so when people are buying during that distribution event like and they see that price ticking downwards they're like hmm like is is this the right price is this the right price what they're doing is they're speculating on once all of the tokens have been distributed what the free market will dictate after the distribution event right uh and and the thing is like no one can really inform you of that better than yourself right so it's up to you to be a part of the market and determine what that value is to you that's also the beauty of dutch auctions i think and i think it also helps with uh people not you know panicking because they know they've got you know that time and you know because if people buy really really fast it's going to make the price shoot up right so they won't do that so you're pretty much that's also what one element of the fairness of it is that it pretty much modulates the so that everyone who wants a token can get it because you know if you have a especially if it goes over a longer period like a couple weeks right because if we do it over one day what if you know sushi comes out that day or something happens that day and there's 800 gas price or something and then no one gets a chance to get in there so this way you have the buyers have enough time and they don't have to panic and rush it helps with network congestion so how does this uh particular balancer pool help uh against uh bot front runners well part of it is just the uh how the price is going down um it's not to be profitable for a bot because they're not going to be able to sell later at a profit unless someone else i mean i guess there's cases where it could but you can't predict it i mean predictably it's just going to go straight down so if i bought if a bot a bot then it would be selling later at a lower price normally so that there's a disincentive uh to try and game it in that fashion right so it kind of turns control back into the hands of the human right so if you're if you're watching that price tick downwards and then you decide to buy and then you see somebody come in and buy like a lot more later and then the price goes up you're free to sell you you can sell back into it's not a one-way street like you can always so go backwards and and sell at a higher price so if you're interested on speculating on whatever these tokens are are being distributed in this particular way like you're still free to do that right and that's actually making the market more efficient very cool okay so that's parameter number two and i think those to my mind those are kind of the big two ones like those are really where i think a lot of the innovation and flexibility will come through so we'll we'll kind of like run through the remaining four um adding and removing approved tokens from a balancer pool why would somebody want to do that all right well there are there are a few use cases for that uh part of it is sort of sort of sale like if you wanted to reuse it if you wanted to reuse the same pool for you know the app one tokens you know you could um you know remove the map zeros and add the bat ones um and it's also just the way uh if if you know you're not gonna need the pool later uh and you might just just it's a it's a fast way to just for the creator to just remove all the liquidity right away without having it because otherwise it's it's a little bit of a difficult process if you don't have the right to remove tokens uh you can exit the pool at the end if you're the controller but there's uh uh limitations on like ratios and things that have to be maintained so you can't withdrawal in one step you have to do it kind of in a stepped fashion right um so uh we'll get that's a little technical there but uh that's the main case but adding is of course dangerous right because you alluded to that case before someone could you could add a worthless take worthless token to the pool and then manipulate the price and drain it so for that reason there's a uh there's a time lock on it you have to say okay we're gonna there's a commit ad we're gonna we're gonna add a token in two hours or whatever the time is and then uh people can withdraw if they don't trust it before it's actually applied right and that's one of the parameters too so some of these things are not just the rights they also have parameters with them so these adding and removing and the updating weights both have uh time parameters so there's a minimum time between uh frequency of weight change and a minimum time you know between uh adding a token and committing it and these are our factors that investors in the pool would look at right and when determining how much to trust it and as you can see if you made a if you may want to add remove right and zero zero like no limits at all then you have to trust them completely because they they could do that that exit scan with a token without any warning right so there's the variables that we're talking about have variables inside of them and it's all worth talking about and make sure that you know what you're doing when you interact with a particular balance or pool and the gui will show that you know that we will have you can you can see not only the rights that it has but the the you know the setting really that's the only one that has i guess uh extra parameters with it you know but they can see both the rights and the settings to decide you know how much they trust the pool cool awesome okay and moving on to uh variable number four the ability to enable or restrict people that can provide liquidity right and so what this is just doing is just saying like hey uh it's just making a an approved list of people that can provide liquidity right and so when we started this conversation we talked about um the private pools where there's just one single person that owns the pool that can provide liquidity well now we can have three people or seven people or 20 people who are approved to provide liquidity and you know off the top of my head i can't really think of a use case for this but it's just again it's more flexible right it's just more adding flexibility to what a uh institut what how somebody can leverage a pool uh jeff when you think of these things like why would somebody want to add more than more than just one person who is approved to provide liquidity but not the whole world have you guys thought about a use case for this yeah there's there's a couple different ones i mean i mean first the probably the most the usual case is is to just enable that right and not put anybody on it so that only the create only the creator can can uh you know provide liquidity and most of the so for like the perp did that you know a lot of the liquidity boost providers because they don't want people kind of messing with it and because you if someone made a large deposit or adding liquidity in different ways it could throw off their their curve so um a lot of the liquidity boost trapping actually has this parameter and i think your your dutch auction will use it as well um but if you wanted to that's the most common use is just not let anybody do it but if you wanted to have it where there's a list of people it might be something like well sort of like the institutional thing uh in case of a of a private pool um where you have like an investor club or something where you have or you need to do kyc or something or your order it's like the token is a reward token that you have to do something to earn and only certain people have access to it something like that right we haven't had a real world use case for it but that's what i'm imagining and then the the fifth the fifth out of six variable is uh capping or uncapping the total amount of pool tokens right and this is just like a risk management system basically what this is doing is saying like hey we're going to allow up to two million dollars in this pool but no more uh or or uncap it and be like yo like throw as much money into the system as you want and to me this is just like investor protections or liquidity provider protections are there any other reasons why somebody might leverage this feature i mean that's the main part of it is yeah for experimental ones you could have it where you just cap it at a certain value there's a couple different ways to cap it you could say um cap it at the current value so no one can join unless people exit so if people remove liquidity then there's like space and people can different people can add it or you can just set it to zero which means no one can add at all and and only all they can do is withdraw right and then if it's experimental and you're ready to let it go say okay it's proven then you can just set unlimited and then it just opens it up could you set a timer on it saying where uh we are capping it at you know this amount and then at this particular block it's uncapped is that a thing i'm not in the contract now but now it's just the thing you can call you can you can just set the cap if you have that right and if you don't have that right then it's just it's just unlimited and there's no you don't have that you know it's just like any other pool okay and then and then the last one uh which is pausing and enabling swaps which is super self-explanatory is like i call it the can you guys please stop trading uh feature uh and this just like locks down trading and and opens it up and again like i'm sure there's a billion different reasons as to why somebody might want to leverage this and it's just one of the many tools in the tool belt for a balance or smart pool yeah it could be yeah more of a short circuit like something bad is happening we don't know what's going on let's just like halt because of course if there's no trading nothing is changing no no weights and prices it freezes the effect of freezing the prices can you still uh withdraw liquidity um oh yes yes it's independent this is just actually doing swapping right okay so this is like the big red buttons that maybe maybe something went wrong with a token contract uh maybe some some hacker uh got control over a token contract somehow and minted at bajillion tokens and somebody somebody with the power to pause swaps could hit that button that big red button that pauses swaps and that protects all the liquidity providers who are in that pool from getting their their liquidity drained uh from this hacker that would somehow manage to like mint a bajillion like snx tokens or whatever right because that's happening at the corporate level that that's just getting passed down you're just calling pause on on the corporal because normally you can't you can you can't uh turn it back on um if you have a court rule go ahead jeff yeah i borrowed some uh the capping i borrowed from pai dao no yeah pai dao is was the original uh smart the first implementation of a smart pool was actually paid out so they uh they have a different um you know they're using our underlying core pools but it's a completely different code base you know it's upgradable has a dao it predates uh this and that that's another another great case yeah very cool very cool uh so so jeff uh i think you before we call you the before our call you mentioned that uh you guys have this uh ui that's coming out uh at the day of recording when this video is released it should already be out but i'm calling it like the the build a balancer ui tell us about that okay right well there will be uh so on the main pool management interface right now you have the the private and shared and you're gonna have you know private and shared and smart and then uh see you if you can see which which pools are smart pools um at the core pool level they'll all work the same but you'll also have a create a pool so if you want to make your own pool then there's an interface for that and you can choose which rights you want and what your settings are and then once you once you create it then there's also a management interface so according to which rights you set like if all you enable is swap fee like you're doing the search thing and all you all you have is the set swap fee then your your controller interface just has one thing on it you know that's all you can do is change slot fee but if you can do weights then it'll have all the you know different ways of updating weights also so an ongoing management thing and then even the general public uh if if a pool has the uh changed rights the change weights right enabled then the general public can call pokemons to actually change them so they'll even be an interface for that that's really the only way that uh a non-owner can interact with the smart pool at that level right very cool so so i don't really know solidity i i've spent like maybe 30 minutes and i found out it's not for me but as somebody who still is good with computers maybe this uh build a balance or pool ui is kind of fit for me because like i understand what all these contracts are doing i understand like maybe i have a particular goal uh and so if that sounds like what this ui is for right and it'll it'll expand over time i mean right you know when it comes out we're adding they'll be adding stuff we have some great a couple great ui guys and uh so you know they'll be adding features over time um maybe even something similar to this because part of it is this is complicated you know there's especially when you're gonna like how do you change the weights or what if you're in the middle of a sale and something happens and what do you do and you know um i have simulators off off-chain simulators that that show that we may we may integrate something like that into this eventually that's down the line you know um but the yeah the one the one that'll be coming out for beta testing already has everything you need to build your own smart pool and configure and maintaining it awesome looking forward to it yeah really you want to do it as simple as possible and and perp they made they created the pool and they set the update weights and then that's it and then they just removed it at the end they made like four calls the whole time so that's that's the ideal plus calls to poke you know uh that's the ideal thing there you should need to do a lot of maintenance on them yeah and i'm super bullish on especially with this you are getting integrated i'm super bullish on people using this as a way to distribute tokens and specifically a way to distribute tokens fairly right like this is kind of like a a new way to distribute tokens in a way that we've relegated a lot of the the accounting and trust to robots which again that's what we're all here in d5 for so jeff fantastic job building out this brand new product for bouncer and and thank you for coming on and helping uh helping introduce the nation to it thanks for having me
