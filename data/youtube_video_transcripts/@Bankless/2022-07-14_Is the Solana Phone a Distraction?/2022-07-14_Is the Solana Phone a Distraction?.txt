some people are saying like and it's holy Raj look building a scalable blockchain is freaking hard enough and like there's a lot of work to do is this a distraction or why not have a separate team do this why are you guys personally involved for the same reason that you can't like add more engineers and accelerate the merge you need experts that are deep working on hard problems and a lot of those hard problems are solved by only one engineer that just given time and space to do it and there's a really strong core team of system Engineers that are constantly iterating on the chain and making it better and cheaper and faster and more reliable people think it's a distraction but part of the reason why this idea came to fruition is that I talk to devs and I constantly ask him what are the problems they're dealing with what are the challenges and like half of the conversations ended up mobile like we can't like do what we want and when that problem gets repeated to me over and over I start you know facing around the room trying to figure out how do I fix it
