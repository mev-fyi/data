the ronin bridge has been exploited for 173 000 eth and 25 million usdc the ronin bridge of course is a side chain that axey has been building out there was no malicious attack there was no just like smart contract exploit the attacker just got all the private keys and so then he just withdrew all of the ether and usdc down to the main chain okay so you're a bank robber you steal 600 million dollars from a bank what the attacker does next is he deposits all of this i don't know if all the money but a lot of this money into ftx that's like a bank robber robbing 600 million dollars and going to a different bank and depositing it this hack happened on march 23rd wednesday march 23rd no one noticed until the 29th i forgot about that six days later and so people were probably sending eth into the chain because that was probably fine but like getting back out there was no there was an empty vault six days 600 million dollars went missing for six days
