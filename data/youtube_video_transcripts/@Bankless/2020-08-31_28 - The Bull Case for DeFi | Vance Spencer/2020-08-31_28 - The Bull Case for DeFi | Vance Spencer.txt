[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i am here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how are you doing after that epic episode we just came out of perhaps the best bankless episode we've ever recorded with vance spencer of framework vance got on my radar when he did the podcast with uh dimitri from hidden forces and he just nailed everything i thought about defy and so we wanted to get him onto the bankless podcast to do a podcast with two hosts that live inside of the defy ecosystem instead of outside of it and vance just hid it out of the park this podcast was absolutely insane we kind of go through the the history of communities that came out of the 2017 mania went through a grueling bear market together created culture while the well their respective teams created protocols and turned into the d5 protocols that we know of them today and then we talk about liquidity mining and governance tokens and distributing ownership over these pseudo equity cash flow protocols and then we talk about how these things compose together and then we finish off with some of the most insanely bullish predictions i've ever heard ever about crypto at the very end so you guys got to listen to the whole thing this this episode just flowed so beautifully ryan what'd you think about this episode yeah you know we always talk about it in the in the intro we always talk about how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is an episode that will help you front run the opportunity because vance and the framework folks have been front running the opportunity in d5 since the whole thing started in 2017-2018 so if you listen to like one episode on d5 and you're trying to get insights into what's next what's the future trying to understand how to like invest deploy capital in the space this would be the one to listen to of course the 27 episodes previous are also some essential listening as well so if this is your first bankless episode go check out the archive a lot of gold in the archive and we've been building up to this point david you know what i've got kind of no more to say on this i think we should just get to the goods and go right into the episode yeah there's nothing more that we could add to this insanely dense episode but before we get there we're going to take a moment to talk about our fantastic bankless sponsors the first sponsor i want to tell you about is ave ave is a defy protocol that you absolutely have to check out what can you do with it you can lend you can borrow banklessly all on ethereum so you could do things like lend die to the protocol it will magically transform that die into an interest bearing die account not just die all sorts of crypto assets on ethereum you can also borrow against it ave has been climbing up the leaderboard as well and they've recently released avonomics which is their token economics upgrade you can read more about it we will include a link in the show notes so avonomics grants key decision making to ave token holders it creates more safety and economic incentives to reward protocol growth one of the coolest things is it actually introduces a safety module so there is staked ave becomes a collateral of last resort you can find out about ave avonomics start using the protocol at ave.com that's aave.com for those of you that have been transacting on ethereum you've noticed that the gas prices have just been insanely high you know 60 gwei on a good day and sometimes all the way up to a hundred way which is really reducing the amount of activities that is really feasible to be able to do on ethereum this is where our newest sponsor loopring comes in loopering is a zk roll up scaling protocol for ethereum for both trading and for payments uh zk rollups that stands for zero knowledge rollups it's basically cryptographic magic it allows you to combine activity and transactions into one single bit of information which means that massive amounts of transactions can be bundled into a very small chunk of information which reduces the gas per transaction at loopering.io you can find a zk roll ups based exchange and also a payment mechanism all with the same security guarantees of the ethereum l1 blockchain which is really important so loopering and zk rollups allows you to scale up transactions trading payments into thousands and thousands of transactions per second but with the same security guarantees of the main ethereum blockchain which is just incredible in september loopring is releasing the loop ring wallet this will be a mobile smart contract wallet with zk roll ups tucked in natively i'm really excited for how this is going to impact the adoption of ethereum the rest of the world will be able to experience venmo type transactions but with the same amount of trustlessness and security of the decentralized future ahead of us so if you're a trader that's being eaten alive by gas fees visit loopering.io to get onboarded into ethereum's cheapest and fastest exchange all it requires is an ethereum address and you can trade on a high performance order book completely gas free and transferring ether and erc20 tokens on the platform is completely free if you visit loopering.io enter the code bankless in order to get the highest vip tier for six months so check that out there's a link in the show notes visit loopering.io enter code bankless alright let's get to the episode with fans [Music] bankless nation we are so excited to bring on our special guest vance spencer vance is the co-founder of framework ventures which is a d5 first crypto fund we'll talk about what that means in just a minute but it basically means he and his partner had the thesis of d5 before it was cool now everyone's doing it he's got a background in silicon valley as well vance how the heck are you doing is this a d5 bull market my friend that we're in hey uh thanks for thanks for having me on uh is this a d5 bull market it certainly seems like there's a lot of enthusiasm i think uh you know with all the vegetable coins coming out euphoria um yeah i think it's uh it's it's good to see the technology progress it's good to see the community rallying around these kind of new primitives it's good to see more usage in the space uh i don't know if i would call it a bull run quite yet um but uh certainly thanks for heading in the right direction all right so maybe i missed some vegetable coins guys what else is there i know there's yams but are we at like you know potatoes are we broccoli yet his hair and spams you know spaghetti the whole food camera will be fight coins so we're hitting all the food groups yeah you gotta hit all your food grapes for proper nutrition i mean we're not specifically bullish on one section of the food pyramid versus another but [Laughter] it's good to see the whole food pyramid getting the the attention deserves well well one thing you've been consistent on is your consistent bowl thesis for d5 can we talk about that for a minute if you if you were to summarize vance the framework bull thesis for d5 the why d5 what is it our our pitch on d5 is three things you know number one finance is the world's largest market for consumer enterprise software number two there's been almost no innovation in finance for the past 30 or 40 years and and the reason there has been no innovation in finance for the past three or 40 years is because there's no developer sandbox if you develop a game or if you develop a you know social networking app you can go to the ios app store you can get it on test flight you can get instant distribution into millions and millions of iphones if you want to develop a financial product your path to getting that out into the market is effectively to go work for goldman or morgan stanley for 20 years get senior enough to propose you know some new exotic instrument and then hope to get it pushed through you know there's really no developer first ethos in finance until now and what we think defy is uh and and this is always evolving but you know generally it is the developer sandbox for finance you know today anyone in the world whether you're a developer in india developer in china you know smart kid living on the west coast east coast united states whatever you can go and build synthetic assets you can go and build an amm you can go and build new and interesting applications built off the financial primitives and the tooling that is based on ethereum today and that's something that's fundamentally new and when things get you know 10 to 100 times cheaper you know innovation naturally explodes you saw that with amazon web services you saw that with the iphone becoming this new developer platform and distribution mechanism and you know i think that's kind of where our our bull case for d5 comes from um on a really general sense in a very specific sense you know we're bullish on the people in the industry i think it's all just about people um you know you have the andres you have the michael from curbs you have canes you have robert lesnar's you have runes like these are very unique people in the sense that you know these probably aren't the likely candidates to go and start an equity-based company but the the dna of a founder in this space is just so much different uh and it's so interesting um and they move so fast that it's just hard to not be as bullish on the space as we are on the people in it you know itself so it's really the permissionless aspect of it yeah yeah i mean you know i'm i'm super excited to see how we can uh put the supply chain on a blockchain and track strawberry shipments in real time but like i think the real innovation is going to be um just new things that we can do with this technology and and just the the creativity of developers around the world you know seeing robert lashner build a unicorn in two years like that's a huge just flag that he planted in the ground and that's going to serve as a rallying point for people um yeah so vance i've just on this permissionless point for for just one second i've you know some people outside of defy have said well if the traditional banking system just opened up all of their apis you'd basically have the same thing so there's efforts to do that in europe and maybe it's more advanced in europe than it is in uh the us do you believe that's true like what if all of the banking like infrastructure api layer just sort of opened up would we have permissionless finance that way too so the european regulation as it relates to banks is effectively opening up all apis for read access that's a lot different than write access and it's a lot different than fully kind of embedding a permissionless permissionlessness within the the banking stack itself so you know i'm pretty bearish on uh just like the open up the bank apis and we'll have a permissionless finance uh kind of ecosystem today i really think you need to re-architect this stuff from the ground up yeah vance you you said that you're bullish on d5 because of the financial sandbox and there are and what we're talking about is there are perhaps ways that that the legacy system could open up and be a little bit more uh modular and experimental but why at the core of the of the problem why is traditional finance so gated like what who's gating it is it the private banking industry or is it like the the uh nation state regulations why can't we have what we have in the defy world today with ex with financial experimentation in the legacy system like who's holding that back it's it's honestly a mixture of both um you know the enterprise enterprises that control the financial stack as it you know lives today they really have no incentivization mechanism to open it up for third-party developers um and and to a true permissionless financial system um they would have to develop new business models they would have to potentially cannibalize what they already have going it's uh it's just you know something that doesn't have a very clear value prop for them and on top of that you know they're burdened by regulations and you know things that they need to do as a financial services business to stay compliant within whatever geography that they're currently located in so you know there's the old adage that it's really hard to turn like you know a hundred and hundred and just a huge cruise liner but with a smaller boat you can be a bit more agile and get place get placed a bit faster so i'm just like more bullish on just this bottoms up developer movement rather than like a top-down re-architecture of the existing financial system so the d5 protocols that we've seen lately and you rattled off a list of d5 entrepreneurs defy seems to be able to offer like the the breeding ground for like a new type of person right and and you you listed like roon kane uh you know just the the leaders of these d5 protocols that are but like perhaps like technically minded they're developers but they're also financially minded as well and so there seems to be like this new breeding ground for these new types of people that are coming from the the finance world and also coming from the tech world that is now enabled to do something experimental and so there is now like so many more like finance startups that are enabled by by crypto and by d5 if you look in traditional industries versus what's going on in crypto you know the amount of greenfield and crypto both on the there's not a lot of people experimenting there yet and on the kind of this is just a massive wave that people are going to ride you know the opportunity is relatively um large compared to just kind of developing a basic you know c corp equity style company um but with that you know comes additional risks like you know one of the things that i ask founders when they say you know we want to do a token we want to hand this over to the community we want to you know fully decentralize this you know one of the questions i ask is like you know are you about that life like is that something that you really want to do you know it's you're playing for a much larger outcome uh because you're looking at basically the re-architecture of finance uh in the 21st century but it also comes with uh you know regulatory gray area it comes with um you know moving organizational control of your baby to a dao or people you don't know i think the people that do these things the best are the ones that just full-on embrace it you know whole hog and just go for it you see andre you know just distributing wi-fi to people based on the premise that this is software that he builds that he will continue to develop it but he doesn't want to organize it anymore you know that's very powerful you see kane doing the same thing with the three dow structure you see robert lester doing the same thing with progressive decentralization it really isn't for everybody but the entrepreneurs that self-select to be in this space are just of an incredible cowbell bird because they're at the cutting edge of financial technology and if just organizational principles writ large and so you know i think maybe it's just the self selection but the entrepreneurs that we see in this space the really high quality entrepreneurs you know that is the real scarce resource and you know they're just frankly incredible when when things really start to to get humming and you know i think the the thing that uh you know all these founders probably won't um come out and say but is readily apparent to me is that you know these people are playing for much larger outcomes than just a c corp you know you might get to a billion two billion three billion dollar valuation for your c corp equity and that's great you know you'll probably sell it you know maybe you'll try to spec it take it public whatever that's great but when you look at defy and you look at you know the cash flows these protocols accrue you know it's very easy to see these being 10 50 100 billion dollar businesses you know the meme used to be you know which coins will be a trillion but like i think that will eventually happen um just because of the way the token works in the system and the way it captures value and just the community owned nature of these things um and so you know i think that that's just a long-winded way of saying that the entrepreneurs in this space they're playing for a lot more than just traditional entrepreneurs and and their kind of caliber of talent and attitude has to match that that pace it seems like you guys aren't just looking in in d5 but part of the thesis is to find that crypto native unicorn founder right and we'll come back to you know some of the founders and archetypes a little bit later because i think it's super interesting to dive into more um but before we do can we talk about another element of the thesis that i feel like uh framework the way you've structured uh your your company is a little bit business and this is if i understand it correctly vance you have kind of two sides to your i guess support like investment uh business there's two sides to framework there's kind of the fun side where you're actually like actively investing and then there's also the lab side where you're actually participating in these networks in various ways so it's almost like a an activist investor type of flavor where you're doing both sides you're investing in the networks but you're also participating in them can you talk about that a little bit so we can understand how things are structured and why you've decided to structure it that way on the activist investor side i think uh activists usually comes with a bit of a negative connotation you know generally like with these protocols we come in peace we're definitely opinionated and we definitely want to see things get done and you know i'm happy to be you know pushy with teams or with the community just in the spirit of pushing things forward but you know our our bias is is uh you know to the protocol and then to the founding team you know in that order uh and you know early on in the life cycle when there's more of a core team than a protocol that may flip but you know once this thing is live you know it's like you've created this public park and it's basically all of our job to maintain it and make sure you know it doesn't kind of just become this tragedy the common style situation in terms of you know labs and ventures ventures is our principle you know investing entity and that's where we do most of the venture work out of but labs the reason why we have that is because you know participating actively out of a fund is very difficult you know there's admin there's audit there's tax complexities but more than that you need to have the talent in-house like we have a full engineering team you need to be building infrastructure you know you can't really do that at a fund you need to have mechanisms for participating participation governance and honestly that works best out of a c-corp and so the idea of labs was just fully borne out of you know how do we provide you know services to our portfolio companies in the way that is the most valuable and so you know you'll see us doing things like you know precipitating governance you'll also see us being you know the largest trader on a lot of the protocols we participate in and that's because we've built custom trading infrastructure that does really remarkable things to help bootstrap volume bootstrap liquidity and show people you know how you can use these protocols an example of that is our futures trading strategy so what we do is you know we'll look at binance and we'll look at the perps on binance and and we'll trade them when the funding rate spikes and we'll hedge that out on synthetics and and you know really we were the first people to figure out that you could do this and that hedging on synthetics exchange was the best way to hedge a futures bet um but really we're building this to not only benefit the network in the sense that we're effectively harvesting yield from c5 and giving it to the synthetic staker base but we're also doing this to show people and lead the way on you know how you can actually use these decentralized protocols to add value to a trading strategy if you're trading fund or if you're a retail customer or really whatever and so labs is really just you know it's our active participation entity it's you know where we kind of demonstrate the value of protocols through uh and then you know coming up here we're actually gonna start you know building things and spinning them out uh and so you know eventually we want to kind of see um you know framework ventures is just one business line that we have um where while labs kind of does you know a bunch of different things to support the protocol to push things forward more generally in d5 and just to be a good steward of the industry as a fund that is an active user of the protocols that you guys are participating in you guys get access to some alpha that maybe somebody that just buys a protocols token on unit swap doesn't have because you guys are you know in the trenches using the protocol for what it's supposed to be used for seeing it positive seeing its best seeing it's negative seeing where it needs to get fixed and then also you have a stake in the protocol because you are investing in the tokens of the protocol which means that you guys are incentivized to work with the teams of these protocols to make their protocol better so how to tell us a little bit about that process so so you guys are users of synthetics you guys are users of ave tell us about your communication with these teams and how this is that kind of a conversation about how to iterate and improve the product yeah so so i think the first thing is that uh and this is definitely different than the traditional venture hedge funds is that we do you know 95 of our business out in the open uh you know whether it's in the wi-fi telegram channel whether it's in the synthetics discord whether it's in the ave discord you know people can see what we're doing and i think that gives them a sense that you know there is no kind of boogeyman behind the curtain um with ulterior motives in the sense that you know we're just very open and honest and transparent with the communities about what we do and i think you know after we did that once people started to notice it after we did it twice it was like kind of interesting but then third time people were like oh interesting these guys are good stewards of the protocol you know we can trust them and i think when you see this like backlash against vcs you know in the market with things like wi-fi or yams you know right or wrong you know i think that's why we haven't really been looped into that bucket just because you know we're super close to the metal we're super transparent and people just know that we come in peace um so i think you know that's kind of one aspect of what we do but you know you're totally right in the sense that you know our whole strategy is that you know instead of being super large we're just going to be super agile we're going to be the first we're going to be the heaviest user we're going to be the closest to the metal like we're going to understand how these protocols work at an atomic level um so that when it comes to making you know investment decisions you know we can make those you know as accurately as any person on the planet um and really you know this shouldn't come to surprise anybody but the only way to learn about stuff is to just do it and then to figure out you know if you're interested or if it's working for you kind of later down the road um and so using these protocols and you know getting into the the dna of what's going on and understanding how the smart contracts are architected and what the vulnerabilities are you know that's just the standard part of our due diligence process and in a way that i don't think is fundamental to many other firms um and that's because we have a full engineering team that's because we have a full training architecture that's because we're just super close to the teams and the dna and the culture of the space itself and i think that is in a lot of ways our unique advantage you know vance it's kind of strikes me that we're just talking about what what you look for is crypto native uh founders essentially right so they're not going to be the the typical you know cast the the typical archetype who would start a silicon valley for well you guys are also not structured as the you know the typical vc fund or the typical even crypto hedge fund it's more of a crypto native fund type approach that you're taking right and what also strikes me is that what you've been able to produce with this approach is this really incredible feedback loop where as you're stewards of the network and you add value to the network well then you start getting invited into the network more by the grassroots community it also provides a way for you to really learn about what you're investing in it it strikes me i don't know if this is if you if you think this is the case but it strikes me that many um even even crypto funds don't actually know what they're investing in when they're when they're buying a token and when they're like investing in something and certainly that the traditional uh funds like have no idea what they're buying do you see a lot of that like is there a information arbitrage that you guys have because you're actually participating these things and like using d5 that they don't i mean you know not to to my own horn but but like absolutely um we get a lot of questions of like you know how are you guys this close like how do you guys have this much information advantage and i think the honest answer is just like this is literally all we do you know michael and i lived together uh we started the fun together we've known each other for for five years and have been you know best friends in the foxhole of crypto and other startups throughout that and i think just like the relationship between michael and i uh and just our commitment to building something that can be you know quite large and hopefully outlast us is really kind of what separates us and just in terms of you know bringing the same intensity to work every single day you know reading everything on crypto twitter meeting every single person you know if anybody on in the link marines or in the synthetic spartan you know needs help with you know the resume or editing things like that like we'll actually help them and it's not just because like this is some like psyop uh you know information advantage it's just like this is because this is all we do literally um and so just being you know as humanly close to the possible or humanly as close to the metal as possible is really where all of our advantage derives from um and i think what's what's really cool for us is like you know we saw uh these couple of chinese uh you know blockchain outlets that posted this full story about us and and it was really well researched and it had all the details of how the fun started and what our thesis was and the projects we've been in and we literally had no communication with the people before they posted it wow like you know i'm on i'm on google translate like trying to like read like you know kind of broken chinese like in english and it just like people notice this stuff like when you're authentic when you're showing up every day when you're bringing that same intensity and when you're just showing that you know you're good stewards it reaps benefits it might take a little bit like we were deeply uncool for probably the better part of a year and a lot of people still think our style is pretty whack but you know this is basically what we do um and it's like the best job ever and we're super thankful for it and and we're just kind of determined to keep giving back to the community and keep pushing things forward um and and i want to get to another point you made which is uh you know these aren't the typical in you know founders these aren't the typical people that you might invest in i think that is like one of the things that i enjoy the most out of crypto is just the the sheer uh volume of the number of characters in this state like like kane is basically a pseudo anarchist like it's pretty funny to me but they're kind of what are you um straight up not even a little bit danny is like this pretty funny uh fin finish guy um you know michael your egrov is a you know ex ex particle physicist um and it's just like the amount of people you meet in this space is super interesting and it's what keeps me super motivated uh and i just think it's just an incredible incredible vertical to be in right now i feel like it's just like the island of misfit toys like everybody you know and then you have then you have someone like andre who who you know he launched wi-fi and then i called him like two hours later just like first kind of out of the blue call and he described himself as you know the joker in batman you know chasing it caught it he wouldn't know what to do with it and immediately after that call i looked at michael and i was like yo we have to buy as much of this as humanly possible that's a complete opposite of what a silicon valley vc firm would do by the way oh yeah and there was discussion about it and there was kind of like looking at the business model and what this could possibly be and i posted a short twitter thread about the thesis on it but you know things like that and opportunities like that you really have to be prepared for and if you have a traditional vc mindset in this space i don't think it's just part of your natural kind of like reflexes to to think openly about that for us like we saw andre and in this anti-vc movement as a theme and the fundamentals of the business were found but like if you're a venture capitalist and you see a theme that explicitly excludes you you know that should immediately be a cue for you to get exposure to it because purposefully you're not supposed to be part of that and if you can kind of help subvert that and help the company and help the narrative and help the protocol like you can add outside value to that investment um and so just like weird opportunities like that uh is just the stuff that we live for it seems to be to me that framework ventures suffered through the bear market just like the rest of us right and also just like the protocols that framework invested in and and one of the topics that we're going to go into is like what what happens to a protocol in its community when it goes to a bear market and how it comes out of that and it seems to me that you guys survived the bear market by just using this sandbox that is defy as your uh ground for sharpening your sticks right as your ground for getting better and and kind of shedding traditional thought and just learning what works in the moment right and then as a result of this you guys have turned into just it turns out what works is just being good uh governors of a protocol as a result of this you guys have invested in uh things that you know have have worked and you guys are now the stewards of these protocols and so at this point how do you guys because you guys have limited energies you guys have limited capital because capital is not infinite so at this point now that you we've gone through this bear market and now we seem to be you know quote unquote going into a bull market how has your learnings guided what you guys now decide to invest in like what are the criterias for a protocol that you guys really look for that kind of matches this thesis that you guys have generated over the last like two years so so i think at this point and and we started with you know probably 20 million um when the fun started um at this point our our energy is is probably the rate limiter and michael and i's time versus our capital you know like we could make seed investments usa investments all day uh but like the stuff that that we've always kind of like internalized and talked about is is not becoming you know the spraying previously that do a bunch of different projects and have you know no conviction or very little conviction and or just kind of working off of the signaling of other vcs and letting them kind of do the cognitive work for them um for us like i think we've always taken a lot of pride in investing in things that are deeply unpopular um you know whether it be chain link which you know nobody has liked for for a long time uh except for lots of kind of grassroots organizations synthetics which you know got hacked was the stablecoin project was located in australia like that didn't seem like a natural candidate to be a good project but all the stuff it just comes down to the people for us like who is leading the projects who's sitting in the chair it's cool to have all these big brand thesis about you know the future of money and you know the future of finance and and all that good stuff and and to a certain extent we want to see you know sound business logic uh good rationale and thinking through the plan um but you know more than that you know the people that are sitting in the chairs are doing the work you know if you have a cornerstone leader like a cane or a rune or lessener they're a magnet for talent and if you get enough people that are smart and they're dedicated and that are in tune with this movement and issuing a token and living that type of life you know a lot of it is possible and so you know i think it from our life cycle as a fund we've shifted from you know being very thesis oriented you know which we still are to a certain extent to being a lot more people oriented now uh and you know in a world where everything is conducted over zoom you know we haven't met probably 70 of the founders in our portfolio in person um it really becomes you know how good of a judge of character of work ethic of integrity are you uh and i think that you know michael and i just happened to be pretty decent at that um but also our networking crypto has just kind of like allowed us to vet these opportunities a bit more um but you know for us the stuff that we really enjoy is is making an investment giving them a year year and a half to get the protocol out to market and just working with them in a really deep way to help kind of bring that to fruition you know future swap is an example of that that's hopefully launching in the next month um fractal is another example of that which will probably you know a little bit a little bit more of a gestation period into next year um teller is an example that we'll launch this year but like that's our bread and butter like working with people and helping them build things that are important uh and you know sticking with them through the good and the bad is is really just kind of what we do finding good talent good people and sticking with them through the good and the bad that that's a great lead into where i kind of want to to go with next with this conversation and and where that is is actually i want to go backwards and i want to go back into like 2018 2019 which was the grueling bear market right and uh you and we've been talking about some of these like all-star founders that are like talent magnets but not only are they talent magnets they're also community magnets right and so far i think it's it's very fair to say that all of the defy tokens that have done these kind of insane returns in 2020 and even before that are tokens that also generated community so can you comment on how these these successful d5 protocols uh are the protocols that came out of the bear market with like a working protocol and a very strong community the talent breeds uh you know more talent and then you know that breeds a community and then the product needs to be there but you know once those things hit full stride they can be very powerful um and i i think for us like thinking about communities and how those spread and how those become viral uh is a fundamental part of what we do and it it's basically just like our ecosystem strategy if you look at all of our protocols you can probably notice a very common theme you know chain link provides data to probably all of the protocols that we invest in you know all the protocols that we invest in uh work together providing their assets to each other um you know giving preferred access to technical resources and just kind of having deep technical and cultural integrations um and so you know i think this isn't something that a lot of firms have hit on quite yet but like when you can take one protocol and you can mesh that community with another it's so much easier than just doing a cold start of a community you know when you can combine things and when you can get people to work together and when you have this idea of a tent where you know everybody's in the tent everybody's growing together everybody's extremely happy um you know that is one of the more powerful concepts in crypto and and i think the marquee example of that is when synthetic started using chain link oracles you know the combination of those two communities really bred this fervor and this interest and excitement in not only a really great use case for chain link but you know a high quality customer and synthetics that could really help chain link and ride the wave of of just defy in general um so i think that's kind of my first point just on the bear markets um just the the resilience and and the perpetual optimism of founders throughout the past you know a couple of years has just been incredible like perpetual optimism believing in yourself believing that you're going to prevail um you know demonstrating passion and confidence like these things are forced multipliers this this can take you from you know a few people supporting your project to hundreds if not thousands if not tens of thousands and you know that's one of the main things that we look for in people is is do they have that perpetual optimism to ride out uh the highs and lows because you know michael and i just from firsthand experience have had to do that as well you know we've had you know years where things haven't been awesome we've had years like this one where things have been really good um but it's all about having the perpetual optimism and the focus that you know you will prevail and that things are going to go your way it's just a matter of kind of banging your head against the wall you know a number of times until it works um and that's kind of the main thing that we look for as we go through kind of the barrier and bull markets that are that are pretty common in this space i think that the most interesting thing that i've observed over the 2019 transition into 2020 of these protocols is the the creation of culture in every single protocol and we have these like these memes these shelling points of like a logo or a mascot for every single protocol like we have the the link marines we have the synthetics spartans i think ave is now the ave avengers at this point and so you know these these community of people who were inherently interested in defy and maybe all had like some semblance of some thesis of defy and that's why they were there all stuck around through this bear mark bear market together and and we're it's the people that are provably in it for the tech almost and then also at the same time there's also the financial returns if you are convicted have the conviction enough but going through the bear market as a community together generates this culture and community and that's why we see a lot of memes coming out of every single d5 protocol that has successfully made it through this bear market and so what i'm bullish on is exactly what you said where each each like a d5 protocol is its own tribe but they're not tribal and the concept of composability in ethereum the composable protocols begins to make composable communities and that ultimately coalesces into this one single defy community that i think is is was successfully tapped into by yams because if you go to the yams.finance page you see a place for every single uh one of these communities to like work with the yams and that's what yams really was was like this pinnacle of community that turned in that captured this energy and turned it into this own meme generating thing and then we've also seen memes and culture already emerge extremely quickly out of the urine the urine and wifey systems uh so when you guys think about protocols and and communities how do you how do you guys fit in culture or is it kind of just like an interesting afterthought no i mean it's it's literally the first thing that we think about i think the the the community that we're best known for is probably the link marines and just playing a very early role in helping kind of develop that but you know to your point it's it's so true like i don't know if you really have a community until it's been through uh not a bear market but just a market where or a period of time where things are more dicey and less sure um you know and a bear market is a great way to purge out the the people who are not true believers um and you know you see a lot of the memes and the culture and the uh the offhand kind of like uh you know inside jokes form in these periods of of tamal and i think that is that's perfect because you know you want to really kind of have a strong foundation of your community and an identity of who it is before you take it to a mass market and the best way to do that is through through kind of a bear market um in terms of your point about like you know composable communities like that's exactly kind of our thesis on community community uh management and starting it's so hard to cold start a community if you can you know use um you know whether it be another community or or just a general theme to kind of bootstrap your protocol to a certain level of usage and attention you know that's the best way to do it and i think a great example of that is is just ave you know really if you look at obvi's rise uh most of its tvl you know at least initially and through kind of probably um mid this year was chain link and they were the first people to adopt chain link oracle's you know everybody who loves chain link you know puts all of their chain link on ave because they know it's secured by oracle's that they trust and that's been a really symbiotic community and you know i think that's one of the coolest things about the space is that it's not zero sum you can have a partnership in crypto that is so technically and culturally integrated in a way that really isn't possible in traditional startups and i think that is just one of the superpowers that this space has is that not only are things technically composable they're culturally composable and you know that's just like something that we think about a lot and you know the other thing we think about is is is just smallness you know the best things start very small and there's this sense of either exclusivity or there's the sense that the rest of the market is ignoring you uh and you know that smallness breeds fervor and that fervor breeds you know a few more followers and those followers are really interested and that eventually kind of slowly starts to seep into the mainstream and identifying these little cultural nuances and determining how they spread is something that i spend a lot of my time on um and i think you know other investors kind of like think of this as like you're looking at memes all day and it's like yeah i'm looking at memes all day but like that's that's part of my job like yeah i'm being paid to identify themes and which themes might be profitable you know as long as they're followed up by solid technology you know hell yeah that's that's what i'm gonna do and if that means spending time on 4chan or reddit or or crypto twitter for hours and hours each day that's that's just what i'm going to do well i guess the the meme is just really the rallying cry for that culture that community we're talking about hey guys going bankless is a journey and you don't have to do it alone so we're going to pause the episode with vance really quick so we can talk about some of the fantastic bankless sponsors that offer you tools to help you live a bankless life as we all go westward we need to get our values into the crypto world but hopefully escape the tyranny of centralized rent-seeking institutions and that's where monolith can help you get your value into the crypto world while skipping over the crypto banks coming soon to monolith is an on-ramp directly from your old world bank account into your smart contract wallet on ethereum and for those that don't know monolith also has a defy card which uses dye in your smart contract wallet but on the visa network so you can go to your grocery store swipe your defy card pay for your groceries like a normal person and still be part of the crypto bankless cryptoeconomic future that we are all excited about so you can get your value from your bank account directly into your crypto visa card without having to go through any crypto bank intermediary which is just absolutely fantastic so in order to get started go to monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card today i want to tell you about another bankless tool that i personally use it's fantastic this one is for our us listeners it's called rocket dollar so if you have an ira or a 401k the problem is it's jailed inside of your brokerage show so your fidelity account your schwab account that means you don't have good access to crypto the only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form and it's marked up like 5 x 6 x 8 x the price you're getting ripped off so what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail set up something called a self-directed ira or self-directed 401k we've written articles about this on bank list that we'll include in the show notes rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up they help you with the paperwork you can break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get 50 off so make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com to get 50 off all right guys let's go ahead and get right back into the interview with fans because there's a lot of bullishness ahead and i'm really excited about it i i want to return to you like the way uh david started talking about this which is the bear market and get back to that theme that you were just talking about vance of of conviction because now that d5 is on the upswing i think we quickly forget um what it was like in the bear market like how unorthodox these types of perspectives were how contrarian they were and how convicted you actually had to be to do some of the moves that you guys made in in 2018 and 2019. i want to talk about some of those moves specifically and some of those investments specifically i mean first of all as a sector people thought not only crypto is dead right but like maybe maybe bitcoin is the only app and there's this you know maximalist uh kind of um movement that did okay but inside of crypto everyone thought d5 was just this niche everybody was investing in eth killers right the next smart contract platform that would replace eth and like supersede it everyone thought that that bitcoin was the only app and like what i'm really interested in is how some of your investments had conviction even among the insiders so um let's talk about synthetics for a minute so you guys are well known for a concentrated bet on synthetics when it wasn't very popular and i'll confess i was i was there back then right so when when synthetics was called uh haven right and haven didn't quite work the way i understood it in 2018 or so was that it was kind of like a a maker competitor and i think that was kind of the popular belief there was this belief that that protocols can't really pivot there was this belief that there was already a stable coin if it was going to work in d5 it would probably be die and maker and nobody was it was not popular to invest in snx to invest in synthetics but what did you guys see that everyone else didn't why did you have such conviction about that investment at a time it was massively unpopular yeah so we we met kane at uh the web 3 conference in in berlin uh last year and and and that was kind of uh you know our first introduction to the team and we met him through sergey uh kind of on the pretenses that they would be one of the users of their oracles and and it really just started from you know a dinner of hanging out with kane and and hearing about his backstory and hanging out with justin and hearing about you know his time as one of the technical leads at mongodb uh and talking to jordan you know their business development guy who is just incredibly smart and savvy and you know back then you know crypto was was pretty much dead um and it was like wow these guys are really talented like what are they still doing in this space like what are they what do they know that we don't know and you know over a period of months like we would have calls with them and we would kick the tires and we would hear the vision and they were very upfront about the shortcomings of of haven and protocol and and the oracle hack and like you know i can't describe how deeply unpopular snx was because like it had literally just been you know one of the biggest hacks in d5 um and you know for us like we we acknowledged that we saw it we took their answers uh at face value that you know they would fix these things that chain link was a viable solution to their oracle problem and the vulnerabilities that it had um and we tried to see you know like where would d5 be going next and you know it's a mixture of high quality synthetic assets that represent not only the us dollar but you know the korean one you know leverage bitcoin leverage tesla um and it's a mixture of that and then it's a mixture of you know these reflexive token economics which not only build a balance sheet for for the protocol itself but it also builds this mini trading game where you know people are hedging their debt and they're kind of treating against each other and really the hardest thing to do in a d5 protocol is to get your first hundred users that are trading real size and this seemed just like a natural solution to that problem and so you know from that from understanding the size of the opportunity you know if you knew nothing about crypto and and i dropped you in krypto and i said point to where the profit centers are you would immediately go to binance and bit max and you would say holy if you can get leverage you know you're going to make a ton of money like this this is the only space that you should be paying attention to this is the only space you should be investing in spot markets are potentially not that interesting everything else is probably too early but if you can get to some type of decentralized bit max you know that's a huge opportunity and you know our thesis has evolved since then you know i think synthetics is very likely to become a decentralized bitmex style player but i also think you know when you're issuing susd sbtc and those are viable uh inputs to the yield farming kind of craze that will that will take place over the next five to ten years you know it has this interesting optionality as a protocol and so you know from that from michael and i talking um you know just from us batting around these ideas a thousand times from talking to kane you know 100 times you know we got to the point where we put in you know i think it was like 16 of our of our fund into synthetics it's kind of one of those moments where you clasp your hands you take a deep breath and then you're like okay uh but you know i think one of the things that we pride ourselves on is just having you know more conviction in our fingernails than a lot of people do in their whole body when they start investing in stuff and i think that just comes from you know doing deep research uh michael and i being able to be open and honest with each other about the shortcomings or the potential protocols uh and just for us you know acknowledging that you know this fund this this concept you know we view this as a startup like it's always day one for us we always need to be willing to take risks that potentially seem a little bit crazy uh to the extent that they're well thought through sixteen percent is a very concentrated bet my friend like kudos for for having that one uh pay off and and again i i just can't uh overestimate how unpopular snx was at that point in time like you know people were calling it a scam people you know it was just um it was not a popular decision to make one thing that's tripped me up and maybe trips me up a little bit still about snx maybe you can address fans is people say it's uh it's a recursive model right so it's basically all the synthetics that you're just talking about which you know a d5 bull would say yeah of course synthetics are going to be massive on uh in d5 and massive on ethereum but the fact that all of synthetic synthetics are based on the value of s and x is somewhat recursive it's almost like you know wells fargo backing all of its deposits with wells fargo stock like you know what do you say to to this point because i think it's trip some people up about synthetics as a platform and as an investment yeah and and i fully hear and understand the those concerns you know it's it's reflexive on its way up and you know it's potentially reflexive on its way down um but for us the idea that you can build this balance sheet in your native token and that generates this reflexivity which you know effectively forces people to trade and bootstraps your first you know 100 users um that leads to uh the idea of synthetics the the trading volume synthetics and just the culture of synthetic spreading to the extent that you know more people learn about it more people trade it who are not snx stakers and then you eventually add in different types of collateral like eth like uh or like bitcoin you know to build that balance sheet out of things that are not just synthetics that eventually you will get to this ecosystem that is not just relying on synthetics collateral but all the fees are going to synthetic stakers that is a bit more healthy and you know those are things that we talked to the synthetics team about that you know we're actively pushing for the the reality is that you know they have a lot of things on their road map that will just outside of you know the question of snx collateral make the debt pool a lot healthier whether that's an open interest funding rate whether that's leveraged futures whether that is um using uh synthesis effectively virtual tokens on one inch and curve to to make this interesting uh virtual bridge um you know the problems of synthetics uh are probably larger than just um you know snx's bad collateral uh if you could you know identify the top three problems of synthetics that would probably be number three to me maybe even lower um i think the better arguments are you know how do you grow trading volume organically how do you construct a trading incentive program that that pushes volume through the exchange uh how do you deal with cannibalization of synthetic volume on centralized exchanges or protocols like uniswap versus synthetic exchange um but like you know these are all good criticisms these aren't these aren't uh bad ideas or or poorly reasoned things to think about um for us i just think you know if you have growth if you have interest in trading since if you can get them integrated into more places um a lot of the growth that comes with that will solve a lot of the fundamental problems of the protocol itself yeah we'll put okay so let's talk about another one so link when did you guys get in into link oh man link um so we were uh we got into link in i think it was september 4th uh 2017. okay all right so so if people are you know you get go take a look at the charts um you know and and see what the price of link was a september fourth you said 2017 not 2018 yeah 2017 okay all right so and at the time right so i think um at the time 2017 2018 2019 or so the probably the insider thought again outsiders just thought this whole d5 this whole crypto thing is dead but insiders thought this um including myself oracles are going to be super important right no no um no dispute there uh no argument there they're going to be super important for defy but link itself has very little value right it's just another utility token and we just came off of an ico mania where all of these utility tokens went to zero right so that i you know might have been the common insider defy insider belief but you guys you started making bets in 2017 and then i imagine you followed up in in subsequent years uh with even more so what did you see about link maybe as a system and also about the the value accrual mechanism of the link that all of the defy insiders and crypto insiders missed so so the the genesis of of our link investment was uh michael found this this paper called town crier which is effectively about how you can securely bring data uh off chain to on chain um and it's written by uh ari jules who's a professor at ic3 which is the cornell institute for cryptocurrencies who we've met a couple times so the relationship was was with some context and we read it and we were like wow this is this is really smart if there was a if there was a monetization mechanism an incentivization mechanism for an oracle network to do this you know that would be very powerful just because if you think about it from a hundred thousand foot perspective you know if you think about where value accrues in a blockchain world because blockchains don't have networking capabilities um you know a good choke point for pricing power and for value accrual is where you know data feeds or or you know output payments get processed uh into and out of blockchains and so you know philosophically kind of we thought that that was probably the main place for value would accrue and that if you built a sufficient sufficiently robust oracle network it would not only be this thing where developers were using it just for kind of one-off price feeds or things like that it would really become fundamental middleware for developers um to really build products and at the end state you know developers would probably end up interacting more with an oracle network as it starts to store private keys do option computation uh bring data from off chain on chain then they actually would the the ethereum base layer itself and so you know that was the original thesis and it's developed over time and you know for us you know we knew sergey uh and so you know the idea that this thing would take two or three years um you know that was okay with us as long as we could talk to him and and kind of you know bounce ideas off of him and and you know when things were super dicey in 2018 we could you know get some just some idea of of what the plan was and uh kind of like what his general vision was for the entire oracle network and i think you know for us we view chain link is as effectively an insurance business um and and we view the challenge token is as much the same if you look at you know the value that chain link is securing it's about three and a half billion dollars right now in terms of you know projects that have integrated these oracles into their fundamental architecture and and you know this is the value that chain link is securing on the on the daily active volume side you know it's probably you know 500 million to a billion dollars in volume that chain link is actively securing uh from mcdex to dydx to um other kind of trading protocols and so really i think for us the the grand vision of chain link is um you know number one it's going to be a payment token for the ecosystem itself but number two uh it's just going to be this this effectively this insurance layer once staking comes out where people are verifying the quality and accuracy of their data feeds coming from off-chain to on-chain and it will kind of be valued at this similar multiple of maybe an insurance company um and so that's kind of the general arc of the investment in the thesis um the things that really tipped us off early to this could be something special was was just the community um in early days that was on 4chan and you know that's where i put his own problems but in terms of a forum for uh forward thinking sometimes edgy talk about uh technology you know 4chan is relatively undervalued um you know it was the first forum that i read about ethereum on uh again the first form that i read about bitcoin on um you know if you're looking for people who are dissatisfied that is with the status quo that are highly technical that's usually a good place to look and i think with the rise of like you know d5 um coins being traded on 4chan you know it's probably a little bit less signal today but you know way back in the day that was something that stood out to us and we could say wow this is informed discussion about what this could be um it's very likely the community brews around this that's another thing only a crypto native fund would do is is like pick up investment thesis ideas from fortune um but it's like i you know for people who didn't uh pull up the graph right so you're talking about september in november or so 2017 link was trading at about 18 cents per link today right now it's about 15. got as high as i don't know let's see here 120 20 okay so that's been a successful investment but like so all of these utility tokens you said you mentioned payment token you also made the case for like kind of insurance why why link has to be value bold because it'll be used for for staking but a whole bunch of tokens in that class uh ended up dying in 2017 and have never come back what is it about the chain link community like so where do the chain link marines come from where does jane link god on twitter like where does he come from like who is that guy who has so many questions about link this so we were doing an interview with bloomberg and uh the woman was like do you know who chain-link god is and no way i was i was just like that is not what i thought we would be talking about but all right um so you know on the token itself i think the most important thing to understand about chain link is that it's in v1 of its network and and it'll be probably 10 versions before the thing is fully decentralized and and the token is fully used in the payment mechanism from the staking or the staking will probably be sooner than that but uh you know eventually what they're trying to do is just build up this two-sided marketplace where you have data requesters and data providers and right now they bootstrap that with the aggregator contracts and they bootstrap that with node incentive subsidies where you know if projects want an oracle you know they can trust the 21 top node operators on cosmos which are effectively the same node operators on chain link to provide that same base layer security to their data feeds and you know if your base layer isn't as secure as your oracle network like i really don't understand the premise of building on blockchain other than regulatory arbitrage so i think that's like the most important thing as the network matures it's going to move from an aggregator contract to more of a service level agreement where smart contracts and node incentive or node operators are interacting on a service level basis to provide data and then have things like you know which type of infrastructure are you running okay how much insurance are you willing to take on this oracle request and so on and so forth so so that's gonna that's gonna take a little bit um but like our vision of this network is that you know it starts with d5 it expands an enterprise and eventually this just becomes the entire middleware for the smart contract powered economy which is definitely a buzzword but it but it's entirely true like if you ask people back in the day about how long it took them to sign documents and how onerous that process was and then when docusign came along how much of a sea change that was in the pace of business and how much more effective things were you know that's largely what i think will happen with uh blockchain and oracles and things like that so you know it's it's a huge bet on you know the future of the industry as a whole uh and the need for high end high quality uh data on chain in terms of the linked marines and where they come from it's uh it's funny like you know populism is real and crypto you know having these leaders which are not um driven by venture capitalists which don't have this kind of undertone as being um you know elitist which you know a lot of honestly the blockchain marketing and the blockchain ethos comes off as uh to normal people you know that spread this community of of you know people that are just interested in the concept that uh you know oracles are powerful and you know they can potentially play a huge role in kind of the next phase of blockchain and i think that you know having just a more diverse base of people than you know smart contract developers and wealthy people that live on the west coast of the united states you know that actually breeds a healthier community than just kind of the circular uh stuff that we see a lot of in you know whether it be fire blockchain at large and so when people ask like where the link marines come from it's honestly everywhere like i've met people who are literally blacksmiths in tennessee that are like marines you know for hitting me up on twitter um you know i've met people in florida that are like marines that are like looking for help with their resume you know it's really a movement that exists outside of the popular narratives of d5 today and you know if you think of things that are indicative of where the future is going that's usually pretty pressing yeah you were talking earlier about that vc backlash i mean i guess this is all part of it part of this this populism and you know i gotta say part of the reason the bankless movement has been so successful to this point is is due to that right like at some level people see the vcs as well as they they should the silicon valley vcs and you know the east coast uh wall street folks they they see those as those people's the banking class like that's kind of what this movement is meant to disrupt right it's it's about bringing some credible neutrality to to the every man so everyone competes equally uh in these markets rather than having an established class sort of get um get advantages so i i i can see it now that you put it that way absolutely i mean that's that's what this whole movement is about like you know you can go on your computer with you know any amount of money you have deposited into ave or yield farming or really whatever and earn money you know there's no middle man you don't need to rely on some centralized institution um and i think that is that is hugely hugely powerful like the the venture capital backlash in this space is is not just constrained to um you know some of the egregious behavior that funds displayed in the 2017 run-up with the smart contract platforms and ideas that just weren't well thought through that that people pumped money into and then dumped on retail but it's indicative of a larger larger societal trend of people being sick of a few institutions a few people having information rights and information advantages over the rest of people and so for us like you know we're all for this populist wave in crypto um just because i think it speaks well to the ethos of what we're trying to accomplish so this brings up a really good point and it's a conversation that's pretty close to my heart and so we have we have ave we have synthetics we have link we have compound and we have the compound governance module and then we also have you know yield farming and liquidity mining and what all these things are trying to do is trying to get tokens into the hands of the users in order to turn over the keys of the kingdom to the users of that are actually using the protocol and you know partly we want to do that because that's part of the ethos of cryptocurrency but also the teams that are building these things need to exit because a lot of what is going on in defy is straight-up regulatory arbitrage right like a large part of the cryptocurrency world is uh ignoring the regulations of the nation-state uh and and doing their own thing in a way that is the the best for the user but not at all best for the nation-state and so we just talked about like the banking class right and and there's and and that is a institution of people and finance that doesn't really want things to change and they definitely don't want the d5 protocols to kind of soak up all the value in the space and so you know if if ave and compound and if all of these d5 protocols grow to as big as we hope that they will there is inevitably going to be some backlash and so that's why compound started this whole movement with this governance token that now all these other protocols are following suit because it i think everyone knows that in the future there's going to be a lot of vested interest in stopping this this movement right like the legacy system the the incumbents don't want things to change because that's what incumbents do and and what this bull market i think really resembles is this coming um you know more or less middle finger to the legacy system that is giving over the keys to the kingdom before the the nation state and the nation state regulators can even like figure out like what is actually going on and the idea here is like we're going to liquidity mine these tokens and get them into the hands of the users so that no one can enforce kyc right so that no one can actually know who these users are and so we just uh these protocols gain anti-fragility through chaos right and so is that is that an okay take is there anything that that you can't want to throw a flag there or is that something that you kind of uh agree with you know the the protocol for launching a protocol today is is much different than it was two years ago it's not let's get you know a bunch of ico advisors let's pump a bunch of money into it let's you know negotiate with centralized exchanges so that you know we have a good uh you know some good price action upon the listing you know let's make the the team lock up super super short so we can get some liquidity on our holdings you know today uh it's it's a mirror image of what happened in 2017. you know no money we're going to liquidate liquidity mine it no listings you know it's just going to be on you swap for whoever whoever wants it uh lockups that last forever you know most teams are doing three or four years synthetics actually voluntarily locked up all of their team tokens for an additional year last month um and this is three years after the initial ico um so really the playbook has been flipped on its head and i think all of this is a response to um just the market shouting at people that you know 2017 hurt and and they don't want to see that again but also it's a reaction to regulators effectively saying you know if you issue this like a security we're going to come after you and you know i think in a large extent what we're doing today is a lot healthier with liquidity mining and distribution um especially the projects that that really have that be kind of their first principle um instead of like doing an equity cap race and distributing you know token staff cap table like compound you know you do something like wi-fi where it's just like the tokens are out there you know go get them if you want them i think that's like a relatively more powerful approach um i think on the regulatory side you know there's there's gonna be and i had a conversation with this uh about this with a smart investor a couple weeks ago his point was you know there's now so much money being made in the space um that and most of it's on paper admittedly uh you know that there's gonna be some type of regulatory backlash like people are are starting to notice and so whether that is you know hester pierce creating a regulatory sandbox for uh you know blockchain protocols whether that is some type of precedent coming down the pipe uh on you know a us-based company uh you know about how they have done their decentralization process you know there will be some type of regulatory clarity which will reorient people in terms of okay you know they said we can't do this you know so this is appropriate and eventually we'll get to best practices where um things will get uh just more and more decentralized more and more transparent until regulars are okay for that and i think you know the point of regulators is to make sure that that people don't get hurt and and when people get hurt is when things happen in opaque um you know information advantage situations where things are more centralized if you do things fully decentralized and if you do things in a fully fair way the role of a regulator changes from this weird pseudo babysitter that has to play whack-a-mole with a thousand scammy projects to someone that is auditing code and making sure that the interest rate on model the interest rate model on compound actually works or the interest rate model on ave actually works or the synthetic staking pool is as healthy as it could be and i don't know if you guys saw this but a couple weeks ago the sec put out a job request for someone who could actually read a smart contract code and i think like if i think about the future regulation that's where i want it to head i want them to be auditing code i don't want them to be playing whack-a-mole i think that is a far higher leveraged uh job that they could be doing um and i think it benefits the consumer just an order of magnitude more that's a pretty interesting take about the the future of regulation in d5 that i haven't really heard before and it's definitely an optimistic one where regulators come in and just like make sure everything is is going okay rather than trying to shut everything down um in a world where compound and ave and synthetics are like you know multi-billion dollar platforms with with tons of value and and it is actually making dents in the legacy financial system uh do how adversarial do you think this world is about to become when it when the uh when regulators find out that d5 protocols actually can't they can't be swayed to the regulator's whims do you think we're about to enter adversarial world or or or do you think it's going to be a little bit more cooperative than that all of the you know if you read all the regulatory precedent whether it be uh on you know mixers or whether it be on uh you know icos from 2017 you know really all head biases if if there is this one centralized actor if this is this one centralized controller you know there's problems if you can get to this decentralized form of governance and this decentralized form of just effectively protocol organization i think it becomes more of an open question to regulators as to you know who is responsible for what um you know what is our regulatory jurisdiction um you know who do we need to come after and you know like we are all for regulation and the maturation of this industry like i think the industry has its roots in crypto anarchism but eventually we're gonna have to grow out of that and i think that's fine um what we should be doing right now is giving regulators the tools and the context to kind of follow us on that journey so that we can make d5 a 100 billion trillion dollar asset class you know something that people take seriously the you know and one of our investors is a is a you know very well-known wall street guy and we walked him through uh and he deposited assets on blockfy um and we walked him through what compound was and he was saying you know what like what do you mean i can get 30 yield this seems like a scam compared to block fi which you know is just a centralized institution that i can trust and you know once we walked him through you can audit the code you can audit the quality of the collateral you can see in real time how the interest rate model is behaving on the other hand block 5 gives you literally no you know transparency into what they're doing or how they're doing it and they're paying you a third of the interest rate you know it was clear to him which one was the better bet for him to put capital on and i think that regulators are largely going to see that as well i think on a human level you know when you take things out of people's scope they don't really take that well because you're diminishing the importance of their job but i think it actually opens up a much more broader interpretation of what regular regulators can do in a market that is completely transparent and so throughout this conversation that we've had so far we've been talking about like the importance of community in in when it comes to like the how these d5 protocols work right like a d5 protocol without a community is not a protocol at all and especially with the coming world of of regulation which is coming to crypto that there's another very strong reason as to why community is so important because if you are creating this governance token that governs over the protocol you need a group of people to hand off that governance token too a governance token without a community is just decentralization theater and then we are going to have the same kind of laws and regulations upon these uh you know quote-unquote decentralized protocols that aren't actually decentralized as they would like a centralized lending institution and and i think that's where like the the conversation of the protocol sync thesis comes into play because communities gravitate towards protocols that are deep in the protocol sync thesis fans are you familiar with the protocol sync thesis by the way before i keep on citing it no no i am yes okay great now that's good to hear first off um and and so so yeah communities gravitate towards things that are dense in the protocol synthesis that are at the bottom a because they're good investments but b because of their credible neutrality right and so i think the protocol sync thesis is going to be this magnet for at things applications protocols that i hope regulators look fondly upon because the reason why they are down in the protocol sink is because they are credibly neutral they are fair they haven't scammed anyone they've they've maybe they haven't followed regulation to a t but they haven't harmed any anybody in the process and so like my kind of bullish thesis for it for d phi at large is that the protocols that are dense a cannot be touched by regulators but b regulators don't even want to touch them because they've dotted all their eyes and crossed all their t's is that a fair take totally i think the the superpower of ethereum is that it's incredibly neutral almost switzerland-esque um you know platform for people to build on uh and and i think that is you know viewed favorably in the eyes of regulators if you looked at the cftc kind of comments on what its security versus commodity status was if you look at um you know even kind of any of the uh big consulting uh firms such as deloitte or ernest and young they they look upon ethereum as this neutral compute layer um and and i think that is the main tailwind that ethereum will benefit from if you look at something like you know pick your eth attempted murderer um it's so much harder to claim you know neutrality in the age of venture investment in the age of you know some of the applications that are getting built on top of something like solana you know getting outside share tokens it just it just doesn't come off the same way and so i i really agree with you in the sense that like ethereum superpower is the sense of like you know benevolence towards developers um credible neutrality and just a sense of fairness and a lack of platform risk uh but you know that that also comes with downsides and i think that with the eth2 schedule we've seen that um you know in a leaderless decentralized organization things just take a little bit more time but you know computers took like 40 years to fully be realized it's been six years since ethereum came out like we can afford to be patient um and if it's a two year time horizon for eth2 if it's a three year time horizon freeze too i think that'll look like a speed bump in the general arc of this technology yeah i think probably both david and i totally agree with your ethereum thesis there it it should not ever sacrifice its credible neutrality for some short-term velocity as many other ethereum murderers as you put it are doing right now attempted murders there you go all right so let's let's move a little bit further to current state d5 and talk about that for a minute so here's something like so bankless listeners will be very familiar with um our thoughts on um defy tokens writ large right that they are essentially proto-capital assets or could become them there are these governance tokens where the governors of the tokens once decentralized can actually vote in cash flows and then these d5 tokens can become capital assets with on-chain value flows or cash flows which means you can value them based on something that you know people are familiar with in the stock market world which is net present value of future returns essentially right so we learned this in business school that's super cool but something that i think you guys realize before maybe a lot of people and before me because i'm just recently observing this as well is that um there's actually even more premium in some of these defy assets than just the value flows and just the cash flows so you tweeted this out vance i caught this um a few weeks ago you said val and we'll take s and x as an example so that's the synthetics token that we've been talking about earlier you said something like valuing snx based solely on volume fees uh volume and fees on the sunset the synthetics exchange is undervaluing it what i think you were saying is that valuing snx just based on its ability to generate cash flows is actually undervaluing it because there is some other hidden premium here that makes it even more valuable i want to talk about that what is this additional premium that makes snx even more valuable than just the volume and fees we'll just take s and x as an example because i think it's a useful one and uh just like a primer on valuation um for those who aren't familiar if uh if you look at any protocol whether it be unit swap or a compound or synthetics you know you the fees that are crew to that protocol either from the fees that are generated from trading uh for useful synthetics or the the spread between uh the borrowing lend rate on something like compound you know that is the basis for what you value the protocol on and and generally you know if you look at uh consumer internet startups or you know protocols themselves they trade on on what is effectively a price to earnings ratio and price to earnings ratios are you know the fundamentals of how you value things in in traditional finance and you know just some comps so so late stage mature sas startups so software as a service that are listed publicly they trade at around 10 to 20 priced earnings earlier stage stuff you know it can range from infinity uh to uh you know being something more reasonable in the you know 300 to 400 to 500 range if you look at all the d5 protocols you know that exist today and you try to value them generally they trade at 100 to 200 times their their fee base on a yearly basis so that's their price earnings ratio so if a protocol has a million dollars in fees it'll probably trade at around 100 to 200 million dollars and this this valuation band is something that hasn't moved in actually the last six months so so it's been relatively consistent is building up a valuation benchmark in terms of my point with synthetics you know there's two ways to value synthetics and by the way fans but before we get away from that valuation band that valuation band price earnings ratio it's not crazy right like that like netflix is about 88 or so high 80s you know amazon is in the hundreds isn't it yeah no it really isn't um and i think like you know you can you can make the argument not financial advice that uh this stuff is you know potentially undervalued relative to its total addressable market um but but really like what the price earnings ratio tries to express is um you know number one how much is this protocol making in fees for for its holder base and number two uh you know what is the market's expectation of growth you know if you have a super high multiple like like netflix at 88 you know people are still expecting netflix to grow a huge amount but if you have something like 100 to 200 in a very early stage consumer tech industry that's taking aim with the largest financial market in the world you know that's when you start to be like huh okay maybe this is relatively undervalued um and and so that's that's part of it the other part of this is how directly um do the cash flows uh of that protocol or company tie directly to the stock or token that is underlying it in a stock like netflix netflix does not actually pay dividends so you know you're never actually going to earn any of that cash flow it's all going to be reinvested into growth of that company for something like synthetics you know you're earning those fees directly they pay out a dividend every single week and so you know again when you talk about that hidden premium it's a result of a few things it's a result of a the moneyness of the token and the monetary premium it accrues um b it's just it's a result of that token having uh just more direct access to cash flows and being a more efficient vehicle for value capture and then c you know it has additional premium because the governance of tokens is more direct than you would have for a stock and so you know those are the three things that are that are generally universal and why tokens uh when compared to equity trade at you know 3 to x um you know what you would see in an equity counterpart um like you know ripple i think raised around at you know two or three billion uh but the tokens are evaluated around 10 billion and so you know it's the market's perception it's the um it's just the general attitude that the tokens have some type of premium versus equity can we talk about a fourth too like a maybe a d here which is what i'm coming to maybe understand so we were talking earlier about kind of this uh this uh token mashup uh david used this i think brilliant term david we want to see an article uh composable communities right and um that was maybe best exemplified first time i like saw how powerful this was in yams where you like brought all of these uh tokens together and like they could be jointly farmed in these yam pools right but uh the lucky i don't know seven or eight or so tokens that um got in those pools were tokens that had really strong communities right very desirable communities right like um you know xrp was not invited um even if it was tokenized on ethereum right but synthetics was wi-fi was um other tokens with with powerful communities and what we saw is maybe this like this this fourth thing which is like a farming token premium i don't know if that's fleeting whether that's just like the current state of things or or whether that's more lasting but when yams launched and started shooting up in price all of the the tokens that had um yam farms essentially where you could farm with them they shot up too right like we're talking like 50 percent in a day for things like comp and uh and and ave lend and uh wi-fi do you what do you think about that idea the farming token premium idea is that sort of just a fleeting thing like one time only uh or is that is that real too no that's uh that's like that's spot on and uh to to the synthetics example that you threw out like you know as a synthetics holder i'm earning money from the fees of the protocol but you know i'm minting when i take synthetics i'm minting susd sbtc s eth and the things that i can do with those synthetic assets are i can put them in curve and just from those synthetic assets alone you know i can earn 45 yield on top of what i'm earning onto the synthetics uh just the the exchange fees and so the valuation point that you were making earlier is like the valuation of synthetic should be the composite of the exchange fees and the yield farming fees that you accrue uh from its synthetic assets and so juxtaposing this next to your example of like wi-fi and yams and synthetics and lend and you know all the tokens that seem to be the potpourri of you know when you're trying to bootstrap a d5 community these should be allowed to be yield farming assets i i agree with that in some sense um but like do i think that yams will be the monetary base for the new financial revolution you know i wouldn't agree with that however for things like susd and sbtc that serve as representations on chain of something that you might not otherwise have you know those premiums are sustainable people will always need a synthetic form bitcoin on ethereum that they can trade people will always need a synthetic form of this synthetic of the us dollar that is truly permissionless that they can trade on chain and so for me i view synthetic assets that synthetic synthetics produces like su sd sptcs eth and virtual tokens as having you know this shot to really corner a market on you know being the uh collateral that allows people to yield farm with um so like when future swap launches you know a usdc sbtc pool you know that'll allow you to earn future swap tokens or you know curve you can put sbtc and susd into like those premiums will sustain you know i don't know if vms or wi-fi as a monetary basis especially including the the locking mechanisms that their governance has if those will retain their premiums long term from just yield farming but you know i don't think that's necessarily a bad thing you know those two assets are absolutely i mean at least wi-fi is just a cash flow machine um and its valuation uh will be reflective of effectively all the yields in d5 at large okay so so you do think this yield farming mechanism will continue to command a premium you're just skeptical on some of the maybe underlying more mimetic assets like a yam for instance right and its long-term value but i want i i want folks to kind of connect the dots here in sort of the analog world this would be like owning a share of apple stock right let's say i owned a share of apple stock and i was able to deposit it into my chuck schwab account and then earn tesla shares as a result of doing that if i deposit my apple shares i lock it up in this brokerage account i can start earning tesla shares that's kind of what we're doing here and we're doing it like in order to distribute the the tokens to communities so it seems to be the case that tokens with very strong communities like like a wifey or snx will just be valuable because other tokens want to harness the power of those communities and they're willing to give them their tokens in order to do that they're capital assets it's like like i'm willing to give apple shareholders uh some tesla that i print because apple shareholders are a fantastic community that i want as part of my tesla governance is that kind of what's going on here yeah i mean it's uh like the distribution of like when you try to bootstrap a protocol with um an interest of like you know if you start um you know wi-fi eight you know the sequel to wi-fi seven and you have yeah and wi-fi and and lend and snx you are kind of like bundling those composite communities into you know what you hope will be an amalgamation of yours um and then like i go back and forth as to whether defy yield farming is a short-term or long-term thing on one hand you have uh you know compound and ave and all these guys messaging that inflation will continuing for will continue for four years i think you know this is basically um kind of the same game played over and over and over again at first people are really interested in playing a game but you know the more iterations it has it becomes you know marginally less exciting i think that you know from yield farming where we build from here is um you know perpetual swaps coming on chain um i think that will probably be the next leg up with with layer two and and things like feature swap or perpetual protocol or derivatex um or synthetic features um and then from there you know we're basically at feature parity with centralized exchanges and so you know that's when we get into the really interesting things of being able to ship high quality synthetic assets like tesla or oil and really you know that's when the centralized exchange experience will effectively be no more superior to defy um and i think that's when we see kind of spot and leverage volumes go from you know today they're about five percent of centralized volume to i think about 50 percent i do want to give a shout out to dan elitzer because he wrote about this concept of of uh composable assets uh in his very old piece uh old for crypto uh superfluid collateral in open finance where he wrote he wrote an article about how you can deposit ether and dying to unit swap and then there's this token that it comes out of that which then you could use as collateral right and you know what dan wasn't equipped with at the time was this world of defy governance tokens which are themselves capital assets that other d5 token protocols are using to tap into to distribute their capital assets uh and so like right now like in this in this world of a capital asset pseudo equity tokens that are yielding a further capital asset pseudo equity tokens right now the yields are good right like and in urine finance the yusd formerly known as the ycrv token it's earning like 50 apr on your die or on your usdc which is insane and then there seems to be like every new week a new liquidity mining yield farming tool that is tapping into all these other pseudo-equity governance tokens that that uses those energy in those communities to distribute their token to make their protocol like governed by the community right and so like we have we have returns we have people leveraging like compound and ave to access the capital in their tokens to purchase more tokens to do more yield farming which and the borrowing of that money creates yield in these protocols which is why people are supplying crypto dollars into these protocols to begin with my point is is that right now the music is playing right and so long as you can access you know 50 apy on your crypto dollar inside of urine there's going to be capital coming into the space to access that um and like people will say that apr like high apr means high risk and that's generally true but also not necessarily like there could be no risk and there could just be just just returns um there's definitely risk by the way um and and so as so long as people are able to access returns like the capital will flow like the capital will come in if and this is the way that it worked in 2017 like people made money and so more money came in and then those people made more money and then the music kept on playing however at some point the music has to stop because that's just how these things work the music just doesn't continue and at some point the music will stop playing and then these at while there will still be yields these assets that these yields are coming from will start to depreciate in price because the selling will commence and then and then while the yields will still be there the assets that everyone owns will depreciate and then that's when the tide will turn and we go from bear market to uh it's from bull market to bear market that's my kind of like 18 24 month time horizon for d5 that's kind of like my game plan that i've kind of integrated in my mind i i think in a lot of ways what's happening right now with the vegetable coins feels unsustainable and that's because you know it probably is people are just forking code that already exists whether it be you know and it's mostly the composite of like the compound governance module and the snx staking contract and you know maybe you've thrown a rebase in there and then it's like okay we're good to go uh but like that won't continue and that won't sustain this industry much more than a couple you know two or three months you know what what's gonna happen is that and and i think we have really good eyes on this just because we have uh a lot of early stage protocols that have yet to launch you know people are gonna release perpetual swaps people are gonna release um uh options uh smart contract platforms people are going to really start to take share from centralized exchanges and then after they take share from centralized exchanges they're going to take share from centralized otc desks and and the market will continue to expand and i think if you think about you know where the yield is coming from the yield is coming from just a fundamental bullishness on the size of the opportunity today which is relatively well defined it's just okay step one eat all the centralized exchanges and and that in and of itself is probably a hundred to two hundred billion dollar aggregate market cap opportunity for d5 protocols probably more you know you look at the valuation of bit max it's around 12 billion you look at the valuation of ftx it's probably three or four you know you add up coinbase that's another probably 15 12. you know you can get to 50 billion adult 50 billion dollars in aggregate market cap on an equity basis market opportunity and if you think about the premium the tokens accrue you know it's probably four or five times that so as long as the industry starts or continues to make progress towards eating these businesses in earnest um you know things are are going to go our way but it's not just going to be the same game of musical chairs that people keep playing uh people will just get bored of that like you know the spaghetti coin or whatever michael and i got into the office one morning and we kind of looked at each other like do we want to find a spaghetti coin like no we we don't want to do that like we've done that it's it's cool um like we have more of an eye towards innovation and what's next and i think you know the things that this next leg up of d5 really depend on is layer two um or you know a new block chain like selana even though i'm i'm less bullish on that um but you know assuming there's progress with layer two and you know i think the one that we're most bullish on is is uh optimism and ovm you know we can we can really make this not just a flash in the pan not just like in in crypto there's this weird conception that bull markets only last a year um and like if you look at every major technological shift um over the past 30 years like that's been a 10 year re-architecting of an existing industry where multiple players have had huge outcomes and i think like that's where we start to go eventually but i think you know the first step there is getting to a transaction latency that can replicate the centralized exchange experience and solve a lot of the front-running issues with the oracles that currently exist let's let's fast-forward advance it's been super cool let's fast-forward let's say some of those oracle problems are resolved front-running problems are solved let's say layer two is resolved ovm's optimistic roll-ups whatever what's next for defy you mentioned a few things but what's really going to add energy for this next bull market cycle do you think d5 will eat the otc desks then it will eat the centralized exchanges um and and it's not going to be this like massive one thing that comes out of the blue and just changes the industry completely it's going to be the stuff that we've seen in the past just composability building on itself you know culture and communities building on itself and you know it'll happen slowly and then it'll happen all at once and and i really think that a lot of the ux concerns about using d5 are starting to be resolved and and like that combined with real layer two experiences um will effectively make d5 competitive decentralized finance in in effectively always uh minus the kyc and so you know going into q1 q2 of next year i expect layer twos to be up and running and i think that's when we really start to see our next inflection point the next three months kind of feel like you know everyone's still building you know dydx is moving to layer two synthetics is moving to layer two some other ones are moving to layer two um and i think that will be kind of you know q1q2 will be when things really start to take off from from attraction and user perspective um but you know also the other thing is you know if something like serum or something like um well i guess basically just serum is successful you know that could really accelerate the industry and and the narrative of eath as a settlement layer in a way that would be positive as well you know i don't think this is here some game um but you know i think it really usually the stuff that that you don't think of is the stuff that uh ends up mattering um and you know we're kind of all eyes on on what that might be so it's kind of this probability cloud of potential outcomes and you're kind of you're trying to guess which one might uh might come true now but making bets on all of them you mentioned a few things may to get specific you mentioned um a teller i think a fractal uh future swap these are unreleased uh d5 primitives as i understand this you want you want to tell us about one of those just pick one and tell us about something new yeah uh fractal is probably the newest one um so fractal is uh currently a centralized company it's it's large market maker and d5 uh it's largest market maker on xerox it's led by a really sharp guy named carson who's uh you know physics phd mckinsey guy but just you know absolutely hilarious and loves to mix it up and and degenerate defy circles um and really like you know we met them and and they were like yeah you know we're we're trying to do this uh centralized market maker thing um you know we're trying to you know maybe you know get bought by jump or something in the next few years and we were like hold on hold on like let's let's turn this into a protocol like you know market making is a primitive that should exist in d5 today in the sense that it is a market neutral strategy that you know everyone is paying an arm and a leg for if you're a project trying to get market made on a centralized exchange you know this should be a public good for people trying to serve and get liquidity just like uniswap is a public good for projects that want permissionless listing and so you know there's so many hard problems with fractal that we're working on right now you know how do you put the trading strategies how do you put the logic on chain you know what's the best way to govern this you know this looks like kind of an on-chain fund how do we how do we shift that narrative to be um you know more of just this is a traditional market maker how do we do off-chain computation how do we build exchange relationships that will allow something like a dow to trade on it i think that's most of the new ground that we're breaking but if you look at the citadels if you look at the jump tradings of the world if you look at um you know any of these really large market makers you know these are 5 to 10 to 15 15 billion dollar businesses like these are huge and they're really the fascia of um the centralized exchange and traditional finance world and so i think building that and building that in a high quality way that can be community run is a public good you know something that we're really really really excited about and the team is just like extraordinarily talented uh and yeah we we just led their last round and and i think that it'll probably be you know another six or twelve months before they get out of the gate but you know building those fundamental primitives into d5 is just something that people need and and you know we hear it from our portfolio companies and and that's just generally the first sign that we look to as in terms of you know this is really needed so super excited about fractal and those guys and and i think that you know in a space where everybody is just kind of forking and copying each other's code you win points for creativity and you win points for thinking a little bit further into the future and i am really hopeful that fractal can be something special that does sound exciting vance this podcast episode has been absolutely insane thank you for joining us i want to end with this this is always fun you strike me as someone who likes to make predictions we'll see we'll see if that's the case and at the at the start you talked about leg one of your three leg thesis at framework is look the the total market size the tam of this entire finance industry is absolutely massive it's measured in trillions uh t with a t um let's talk about predictions by the end of this cycle these things always play out in cycles whether the cycle is one year or 10 years as as it could possibly be but at the end of this cycle um what are we going to see in terms of total value locked in d5 what are we going to see as far as market cap of d5 protocols market cap of eth market cap of btc those are the things i think i would be most interested in hearing about yeah i think in this next cycle um call it the next 24 months you know we'll get to 10 billion and then it'll look like you know that was forever ago i i think we'll probably eclipse probably 100 billion maybe something like 500 billion just in terms of total value locked in d5 um especially as you know things like um you know curve and compound and ave really start to get their hooks into the traditional finance ecosystem you know that combined with a ton of liquidity being pumped into the market by central banks i think is kind of the perfect storm um or just defy writ large wait let me let me make sure i got that so you're saying total locked value right now is about 6 billion up from about 1 billion in february and you think by the end of this cycle 24 months we could be as high as half a trillion yeah yeah i mean i don't know that's unreasonable to assume i mean the these like there's this chart that we have where it's like you know d5 today size of ethereum size of bitcoin um size of traditional finance like like we're not playing for d5 just being this niche thing like we're playing for d5 integrating itself into cfa in a way that that people don't fully understand could happen um and that's why like when i illustrate the size of the total addressable market for finance i'm not just illustrating the size of crypto like i'm illustrating the size of you know traditional trading infrastructure and so you know i think we'll get to 10 billion we'll blow past that we'll probably get to 100 billion um and then you know it really depends on on where bitcoin and ethereum go um you know if if we get to 100 billion and then ethereum quadruples like you know we're pretty much looking at a a new asset class in a way that really has not been described before and so i mean my personal bias is that people have trouble thinking in terms of exponential regression um most people think in terms of like linear step changes um and so you know i'm hopeful that we get to 100 billion and then optimistic upside is is 500. all right hit us with eath market cap and bitcoin market cap 24 months into the cycle oh man um eath market cap i mean you know that's tough uh i think you know we'll be looking at you know probably yeah you know 500 billion trillion dollar protocols at some point you know i don't know if it's really going to be in this cycle it could very well be um but like you know the market opportunity for this and it just seems odd to talk about because it's like you know three guys on a podcast in a relatively niche industry but like this is this is the promise of this technology is is is actually becoming this neutral settlement layer that the people all around the world actually use um and and so you know i wouldn't be surprised to see you know a couple of these protocols become a trillion dollars you know at some point so here's one for you ether flipping bitcoin is that on the table i mean you know personally i've never been a gigantic fan of bitcoin i think there's just some logical absurdities um on just like its general sustainability um and i'm much more bullish on more expressive platforms that have internet native culture so i do think that will happen at some point um you know when you have things like staking when you have things like um you know e2 phase one coming out it feels pretty you know undeniable that the potential of ethereum will be known by the wider market so you know i i feel somewhat confident in saying that yeah eath will flip in bitcoin at some point in this next cycle bullish fans yeah bullish definitely advance david you and i need to get ready for some new bankless podcast visitors and listeners if everything vance said comes true it's gonna be a crazy 24 months uh vance it has been an absolute pleasure this has been a load of information i think the bankless nation is really going to enjoy it thanks for joining us awesome well thanks so much guys i really appreciate it all right everyone uh this has been episode number 28 with uh vance spencer that is from framework ventures and action items today guys um i mean you've heard us take some time to digest all of this that would be my first action item suggestion because there's a lot here maybe listen to the podcast again maybe a third dime at half speed if you want to pick up everything also start to get involved in these communities do what vance and framework are suggesting except on your own on a micro level get involved in the wifey get involved in yam governance proposals if you want get involved in synthetics governance just to see what these networks are all about that is the bankless way and that's how you start to understand what these tokens are what the investments that you're making ours by getting involved getting active in these networks we've also even put out a eth validator how to join as an eth2 validator and test net that's a way you can get involved as well in ethereum two and what's going on there and understand the latest state of the test net we'll include that as a third action item and a link to that um in that that was written in bankless just last week guys as always this is not financial advice risks and disclaimers eth is risky so is crypto so are the assets we talked about today if you choose to use some of these protocols remember you could lose what you put in there can be hacks there can be bugs but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music] you
