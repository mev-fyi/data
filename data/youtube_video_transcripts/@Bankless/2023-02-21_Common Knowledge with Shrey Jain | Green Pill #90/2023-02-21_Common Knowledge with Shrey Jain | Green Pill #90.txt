foreign ation and on the Pod today we have Trey from Microsoft research he is an applied scientist there and we are talking about common knowledge so basically common knowledge is when you know something and I know that you know it and everyone else in our community knows that you know it and I think the most famous example in the web 3 space of common knowledge is uh blockchains so the Byzantine generals problem which is that the foundation of how Bitcoin creates consensus of the common knowledge of what is the state of The Ledger is probably the most famous example of common knowledge being a game-changing thing in the web 3 ecosystem but it's also an important thing in supply chain Bank settlements Civic trust defense public goods funding what's the point of having a perfect funding good funding Goods public goods funding mechanism if you don't have common knowledge in your community about which public goods are good in that community so Trey is just to get your brain this is one of those just very lucid intellectually Rich episodes in which we are talking about something that's game theoretically really important and because it's game theoretically really important I think it's a high leverage point so uh basically on this podcast you'll see us talking about things like collective intelligence super modularity common knowledge these things that are game theoretically important for creating coordination for creating a coordination we'll always be seeking out the highest leverage points so I think common knowledge is is a tool in the tool belt as we think about creating more coordination and solving coordination failures which is the Cornerstone of creating a regenerative crypto economics movement in in my view so really fun episode with Trey

going uh not too bad I've been looking forward to this episode for a while so I'm really fun I'm really excited to to dive in on common knowledge so let's build some common knowledge what is common knowledge yeah exactly so common knowledge is this concept that is from in many different fields of Academia both economics psychology uh and computer science and it's this concept of representing the knowledge that people have in a given setting and so the the formal definition of common knowledge is a proposition is said to be common knowledge if everyone knows that this proposition is true everyone knows that everyone knows that this proposition is true and everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows what this proposition is true which is a very confusing and very Academic Way of defining common knowledge and I think for the computer science listeners um listening to this podcast maybe the canonical problem of the Byzantine generals problem may feel much more um you will ground this concept a bit easier and so if you're familiar with the Byzantine generals problem it's this problem where you have two generals who are who are on either side of a mountain that want to attack and they can't communicate with one another with one another without a messenger and this messenger has the capabilities of being lost and so you can never with 100 guarantee ensure that your message was delivered and so what happens is for a given General who sends a message they say let's attack at 6 pm and so for that General they sent the message the question to the audience is do they do these two generals attack at 6 pm the answer is no because the other General uh sorry the general who sent the message doesn't know that the other General will received the message let's say now that that other General acknowledges the sent message and they say I got your message let's attack at 6 PM do they attack well no because the receiving General doesn't know that the initial sender General got the acknowledgment and this happens for infinite amount of time and in theory they never attack and so I would just interject like sorry sorry to interrupt you I was just gonna say that like my understanding of the Byzantine General's problem is that a coordinated attack leads to Victory and an uncoordinated attack leads to defeat so like this common knowledge of are we going to attack at dawn is literally life or death in this game theoretic scenario yeah and it says game theoretic scenario that it's not too unreasonable to extrapolate to the real world when you think about protesters in specific settings if a one protester goes alone in front of an area under which they could be killed if they go alone but could potentially take down um a Empire empire who's potentially putting you know all the citizens subject to um paying if they go in thousands of people they can potentially take them down but with one person they they get killed potentially and so it's under these specific scenarios having common knowledge is almost a necessary requirement for uh successful coordination outcomes and we see this at various different degrees the extreme forms we're talking about here but even more subtle forms whether it's Supply Chain management how we're coordinating to sign a contract or how we're coordinating to take action in any given uh outcome today where communication is involved right well I mean a couple points on this so the Byzantine General's problem as I understand it is solving it is the core Innovation behind proof of work and Bitcoin and what it's a what allows us to have decentralized ledgers today um is that right that's right and I think there's this really great paper um by Joe Halpern and Raphael Pastor two professors from Cornell that have a knowledge based analysis of the blockchain protocol and they they walk through why blockchains are uniquely suited to facilitate common knowledge and they walk through this like very uh elegant proof as to why that is but in general these concepts are precisely what you said it's these consensus building mechanisms and the way that data is appended to the blockchain network that allows us to achieve close to common knowledge which known as common P belief because we can never achieve exact common knowledge if we can ever have a message fail and so that's why we call that term common P belief okay so the difference between common knowledge and common key belief is is what can you just say one more time yeah common P belief is a probabilistic estimate so with probability P we have common knowledge basically of this proposition being true and with probability P everyone knows that this proposition is true and with probability P everyone knows that everyone knows that this proposition is true because we can never have 100 probability in any given digital communication uh setting as of right now at least so this isn't really interesting for me you know as most listeners know I was involved in Bitcoin early in my web 3 Journey which is all about funding public goods things like open source software which create billions of dollars in economic value but there is no business model for them and so how do you fund public goods in the web three spaces like the ultimate sort of coordination failure that I think that that we've been aiming for and um you know we've been talking a lot on this on this podcast and just in the get coiniverse about quadratic funding which is this mechanism for routing Capital to people and and I think that the mechanism is interesting um because it routes Capital sort of it pushes power to the edges and uh allocates Capital to what's broadly popular among the populists as opposed to what the rich people like but one thing that I think that we like that we sort of Miss in in like crowing about public goods and in retroactive public goods funding and quadratic funding is that common knowledge is the base of an ecosystem like if you have a perfect mechanism for Distributing uh funding to public goods but you don't don't have a base of common knowledge among the participants that is accurate and is nuanced about what is actually valuable in that ecosystem the mechanism doesn't matter so like common knowledge feels like it's at the base of a lot of coordination failures that we could solve in web 3. precisely yeah and I think that common knowledge is part of it's a core to coordination outcomes and we've seen some really interesting Empirical research studies to show that like if a set of participants have common knowledge they're more likely to take risky outcomes risky sorry risky tasks and those outcomes pay much higher than a non-risky outcome generally and so it's interesting to see the impacts that common knowledge can have yet we don't index on achieving this level of knowledge maybe because it's so granular or it's a bit pedantic in in many ways but I think it's interesting to see how when using specific communication protocols facilitating common knowledge can drastically impact the coordination outcomes and we see that with many Supply chains today is a very like practical use of this and we're hoping to see it's use and more like consensus building mechanisms governance tooling whether it be in Dows or more traditional organizations Etc yeah when yes and that I'll that'll add that I think is a little bit meta um is that after I talk to you about common knowledge the first time I tweeted out podcasts or just little pockets of common knowledge so I think there's a meta Loop here where we're creating common knowledge about common knowledge by doing this podcast together yeah and it's interesting you say that because even like let's take an example of what's common knowledge amongst your specific communities and you belong to many communities whether that be get coin the Greenfield podcast and many others that I'm really unaware of as well it's the common knowledge that you and those listeners have that allow you to speak incredibly efficiently with one another as an example when you say like regen if you were to read them to a typical AI like chat GPT it's reading regen with a very different meaning and context than what regen means to the set of listeners that you've established along with the communities that you're part of and like because that information is common knowledge it allows you to communicate incredibly efficiently with those people and maybe a more practical example of that could be the field of law or the field of medicine where doctors who speak that same language whether basically all Encompass in these textbooks allow them to communicate with far more information basically per word than people who are outside of that context and like this is extending from information Theory Claude Shannon's source code theorem which basically says that like what is the minimal amount of weight minimal amount of information that we can basically pack it into a give it a given number of ones and zeros it's when people have common knowledge of a given set of words or terms or cultural traditions and whatever that may be you're able to fit much more information per one and zero in this analogy and so it's like common knowledge is also very important from a perspective of efficient communication not just coordination as well yeah well I'm wondering um you know this feels really applicable to a lot of things like um you know for me the example that that sort of jumps out is these filter bubbles that we're all in in social media where we're kind of talking to these Echo chambers that have not only common knowledge with each other but common beliefs with each other you know the polarization in the United States is partially driven by cultural differences but also the left and the right get just news from completely different places with each other so it feels like if we're going to build social interaup and break down polarization then building a common base of common knowledge might be an important thing I'm wondering where else does common knowledge really matter in our modern information space yeah it's a good good question so I like I like to just Prime the audience with this concept of concept of what's called context collapse context collapses this communication studies uh idea that talks about how our existing digital information structures like when I when I say digital information structures I'm referring to mostly social networks like Twitter Instagram Facebook Reddit they have facilitated this form of posting and information sharing in a capacity that doesn't preserve context of where that information originated and so as an example if I post on Twitter something about our conversation we're having in this podcast you might have the rich context about what it is that we talked about because of our prior conversation but the audience of my Twitter followers who's composed of both my professional colleagues friends family along with people who I work out with or whoever that may be may not have that context and so when they interpret that information it's mixing all these different fields of view into one and so it it when they read that information they interpret it in a much different way and so our existing information structures first of all don't preserve context and so we have very minimal boundaries on what it is that we uh when we communicate and two is that because of that we are unable to determine what is and what is not common knowledge amongst a set of participants because there are no boundaries like the easiest way to determine what is and was what is not common knowledge is to First identify who is in this group of people that we're trying to ensure has common knowledge about a given fact and then two um what how do what what are what is that fact itself but now we have this first problem we don't know who it is is interpreting the information and if they have the appropriate context to do so and this problem is only going to be more exacerbated by the challenges that large language models or Foundation models um pose to our ability of information sharing online where we're going to be flooded with information and we won't know what came from where and this problem of provenance becomes much much more challenging yeah it does seem like a real challenge I mean I guess like what's the information stack here like for me it feels like I'm just visualizing in my mind that information is at the bottom of the stack and then there's knowledge and then there's wisdom and and truth is sort of somewhere around like knowledge or was like what's the taxonomy of information that you think about is it is is it a vertical stack like that um that would just help me sort of visualize what we're doing here maybe I would try to even frame a different stack because I know I think that the one that you're framing is is much much harder I think for me mentally to to frame but I think one that makes more sense is maybe just thinking about how we share information in the physical world and then trying to map that to what it's now looking like in the digital world and so like in the physical world there's this concept that Twitter uses at least called the Public Square and the Public Square is it's like actually very rich historical concept where people actually came together in this Public Square to share information and it was when you stood up on this platform in a public square and you started sharing things with this audience you could visibly see each participant who is in this given room and you could tell if they were listening to you and so when you said something you know that they were listening and they knew that you were listening that you were listening to them speaking so you had common knowledge you also had this boundary of who was inside of that room and who was outside of that room and this is why physical communication is the most rich form of communication today because we're able to preserve context and we're able to establish common knowledge like perfect common knowledge um but the when we try to map this now to the digital stack what we have is we have these public squares and like quotation marks here because we don't know who's sitting in this room we don't know if they're actually listening if they have the context to understand what it is that we're saying and we don't have a boundary drawn on each of our given circles and like group chats aren't even sufficient right group chats are leaky you can screenshot and share information today now that becomes an interesting problem in itself that we can talk about later but that I think is the mapping that feels more um right to me when it comes to how like what it is that we're talking about here is like if we're trying to improve communication flows our physical communication flows were actually some of the best and the internet has actually degraded our ability to communicate paradoxically like um the way we think about it is the internet has allowed us to communicate In This Very broad form to basically anyone around the world with an internet connection right but this efficient communication and this communication in a way that is so Broad and allows knowledge or information whatever you want to call that to be shared very quickly has degraded our ability to preserve context and establish common knowledge which is therefore um really impacted our ability to communicate effectively yeah well I mean I I I think we have in our notes here like how did the internet break our ability to communicate and I think that you like you just sort of went into that like we've created the ability to communicate across um these boundaries and before we were all in these little containers of common knowledge that were like our small towns and our cities and we had these relationships where we could see each other we could Vibe with each other and we could read whether or not we saw each other and now we're all a part of these plurality of communities you know I'm a part of Rocket pool Reddit I'm a part of bitcoin's uh Discord I'm on crypto Twitter and um because we're so fractured in the communities that we're a part of and not everyone who's in those communities is also in our communities there isn't there's these like sort of I don't want to say safe spaces but just like containers for common knowledge any any more um and that's and so we have the ability to communicate across all these boundaries but not the ability to trust or to have common knowledge across all these boundaries and that just creates um a lot of challenges like how else do you think the internet broke our ability to communicate and create common knowledge it's it's precisely that it's yeah like now our our ability to use these different Rich words that have a lot of meaning to a given context like cultural Traditions or um personal stories National memories or um whatever these very rich context-specific spaces that we had established in the physical world they mean much less in this digital space because no a lot of people lack the context to interpret what that information means and so I mean even now you're seeing a lot of people migrate getting towards group chat based messaging as opposed to large Information Network messaging like people yes use Twitter still very actively but there's a large amount of people that I interact with at least who maybe is a bias for the types of people who are trying new types of social tools but are moving towards actively using group group chats much much more than they are social platforms and an example of this is like even Twitter has tried to solve this right they have the Twitter list is one example so you can create a list of different people who are in a specific you know context whether it's like economists machine learning people or whatever you may label these lists um they also have Twitter communities so it's like groups of people on Twitter that post but like for some reason they still feel insufficient and so you're seeing more people moving towards telegram chats iMessage chats whatever that may be to preserve the context of communication and like part of that is because when I communicate in that group chat which is a very small space there is a cost of me communicating like there's a my reputation is at cost like in the web 3 world you could think about how your wallet basically here being part of these small small settings is now subject to being either like maybe an aggressive word here is like Shadow band but more importantly like your reputation goes down and your ability to take your identity with you from one group chat to another becomes much harder and so by communicating in these context-rich spaces you're incentivized to communicate in a much more healthy way as well and so it's how do we move people towards these like context-rich reputation cost messaging spaces which I believe for like reasons we can talk about in a second will become almost a necessity in in the not too distant future due to Foundation models and large language models yeah I mean I'm wondering if we can take this and I'll just play it forward like how is common knowledge going to change in the next 10 years for me that means how are virtual reality spaces metaverse space is going to change it how is AI going to change uh how we create common knowledge and then distributed ledgers I mean those are the three technologies that I'm aware of as Trends but there's probably other social movements in in things that we could reverse engineer out um but anyway I'll just restate my question uh which is how is the evolution of common knowledge on the internet uh going to change over the next 10 years and how weird is it going to get yeah so I don't I don't necessarily have an answer but I have a sketch for what I think it could look like and I think let's just look at some of these different tools separately and then we can see how they intersect so with Foundation models the way I see it is currently you have these tools that are sampling from an unlabeled data set an unlabeled data set that represents currently some distribution of human language right and it's not super polluted with what AIS are outputting it's actually sampled on right now at least quite representative of like natural language of humans as it has been evolved to the digital digital spaces and so like the way we communicate online is a good representation of that data set what happens is like over time the data sets that we're training these models on starts to become polluted with the outputs of the models themselves and so the distribution of natural language actually shifts to no longer be representative of the human natural language outputs but rather the natural language distribution of like chat GPT outputs as an example and so what happens there is that you now have a set of outputs that are going to be dictated by the common knowledge of this new data set basically and so the the real concern there is that our natural language itself will be subject to change and what will become common knowledge will become will be subject to change due to these Foundation models um however like what shows great promise is that we're now seeing a real impetus to use cryptographic signatures digital signatures or these various different techniques to really preserve privacy and preserve the authenticity of information and identity and so I guess as an example right now in the web 3 communities there's this concept of don't trust just verify and this comes from the early Bitcoin community in particular but has now like really I think I think you can agree Kevin is at least a mindset that a lot in the web 3 Community adopt and the blockchain there being an instrument to allow people to verify instead of just trust um this mindset I think is something that we will start to see the mainstream start to adopt due to these Foundation models like what's going to happen in a not too distant future is all the information that you see you won't know whether it's human generated or basically a generative model outputting that information and our initial mechanisms for identifying what is real and what is not becomes into question much much more and so like this becomes a much harder problem for identity verification now because no longer is like a blue check mark sufficient for me to know whether or not that account is real because the ability you to falsify information become so much more real and you have very persuasive accounts being generated that look very very real but are actually very fake and so because we can no longer do identity verification and we can walk through that as well like when we think about how we verify identity whether it's proof of human or like Biometrics uh in the various different ways in which we do this like civil resistance attacks degrade then our ability to create common knowledge degrades and so we need a new suite of tools to be able to be able to first of all verify identities and then verify information and once we can do those two things then we can be able to potentially come back to thinking about common knowledge but until we get there common knowledge is almost unachievable without new ways in which we can protect information and communication flows in the era of these Foundation models boy I mean it's quite scary when you look at how deep the rabbit hole is created by by AI but you know I know before this we were chatting about this tweet from about the authenticity industry um so basically the need for anti-fraud and proof of human and detecting deep fakes and banning Bots uh like whatever the evolution of computer captures entering tests are uh like there's gonna be a whole industry around uh around creating this authenticity and that's gonna enable us to have better coordination if the technology develops to do it so I mean what is the authenticity industry look like to you like what is the counter reaction to uh to these trends I think it's maybe the most exciting thing we could see because I think it's possible that as for reasons we talked about earlier like the internet may have been the most damaging thing to human communication we've ever seen not in terms of like connecting people around the world so they can talk to their loved ones but like from a very root level like human communication has been degraded as a result of the internet because of our inability to preserve context and common knowledge and we've done nothing about that for the past two decades it's possible that this threat from Foundation models and the pollution that we're about to see on our information spaces could be the precise attack we need to be able to start adopting these privacy preserving technologies that many in the web 3 and cryptography communities have long talked about in the benefits of and so again an example today we have the captcha no capture recapture which are basically automated public touring tests right like that's what they stand for like completely automated public touring tests to be able to determine what is a human and what is not captures are going to disintegrate by the end of 2023 potentially or like I don't want to put a time frame to that but captchas are no longer going to be sufficient to doing proof of human our ability to look at government credentials from a photo May no longer be sufficient and we may have to do digital digital signature checks and see like is this signature from some public table of public addresses from the government of the United States or the government of Canada or whatever other governments are part of this so that we can actually verify the authenticity of that information like multi-factor authentication Biometrics all of these are subject to attack in a very real way that's going to make identity verification quite hard but I think there's a lot of very promising work going on that makes this all very exciting because if we can solve these problems and because people will almost become forced to start adopting these privacy preserving techniques we have real hope of actually achieving and preserving common knowledge and context collapse with these new technologies because we'll no longer be able to use these broad-based you know information sharing mechanisms yeah I mean I think that there's definitely some amazing cryptographic techniques and Technology that's being built here the the thing that sort of worries me is how to actually get it adopted and um you know there's there's the whole saying that the the truth can go a mile or sorry a rumor can go a mile before the truth gets off the Finish or gets off the starting line and I think that we see that a lot with rumors spreading on social media um you know social media is great because it allows us to connect peer-to-peer um and we don't have to worry about the we don't only have to get our information from news which is highly centralized and hierarchical newspapers same problem but uh you know there's this problem of viral misinformation on social media and I feel like the internet kind of got ahead of itself where it allowed us to communicate with each other pass information across each other but it didn't allow us to trust each other at scale and it feels like for me web3 and the deployment of cryptographic techniques is like a second wave or I guess it's a third wave if it's a web three of of our ability to to verify information but I just worry that the average person won't understand enough cryptography or how to use crypto products that use cryptography or just won't care because they're so busy trying to verify their their confirmation bias that uh those tools won't make much of a difference so do you have any comments on that yeah I mean it's interesting right I think that if one person was to say like yeah I I think like cryptography tools today are incredibly difficult to use including crypto wallets as being the entry point for for web3 they're still quite challenging to use I think it becomes a inflection point in the way we think about how people interact to communicate like maybe email was hard too to use when it first came out maybe like all these different tools are incredibly challenging to use and I know this is kind of the standard argument for like anything new is going to be difficult from a UI ux perspective but I think when it becomes almost a necessity to use we will find a way to make it really easy to do and I guess as an analogy I think we do communicate in a way that cryptography models uh mimic in the physical world that I think where people are going to start to see these parallels and so as an example me and you might have a conversation at a coffee shop with one another and me and you having that conversation in real life assuming there's nothing being recorded there's no technology there we have What's called the deniable conversation like you can go and tell someone else what we talked about but they won't believe you unless you can like probably show I said something and so like that's going to become a really popular way of talking about talking in the digital world because in order to share information outside of a given group everyone else is going to assume it's fake just given the amount of polluted information that's going to exist so with any given claim you make there's going to be an N number of you know artificial claims with supported by that as well and so because of that everyone's going to be operating in this very low trust and verify environment instead of this trusting environment and so what happens though is like as me and you are having these conversations in our coffee shop and we feel more confident about sharing that information to more public forms we find the right ways to basically like Federate that data up to more open formats whether it be it through conferences whether it be through digital formats or other and I think that this analogy in the physical world is is drawn by the um intimacy gradient and so when you enter a home you can walk into a home and you have a very clear sense of like the public versus private Spaces by the architecture design and so typically a home transcends from being like very public to being very private from the main open areas the kitchen through to the master bedroom and the master bedrooms bathroom and these public cues um that exist in the physical world allow us to know like how we communicate and affects the way we communicate in a privacy preserving way and I think we just don't have those Norms yet in the digital world of like what's a private space beyond DMS and basic quickly open and so I think we're going to get much more like a lot more design exploration there with like what is these privacy norms and where are these spaces going to exist and it's something that's going to take a long time for people to get used to and that UI ux challenge is going to be a real one but I think that as it becomes a necessity I'm quite confident in the builders and designers of this world that like we will get to that space that will allow us to communicate again that's great I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the work that you've been working on with Glenn on plural Publix uh which I think is is about how we can achieve common knowledge and context collapse I feel like you're kind of uh you're teasing it a little bit here but but let's get into it what's plural plural Publix so yes it's a it's a name that we're teasing around with different people it is like a very plural public is a word that I'm hoping other people will start to like understand it's very rich meaning but by definition is just digital communication flows or channels that are able to preserve context of information that's being shared so that's it like as long as we can preserve context in a communication Channel then we call that space a plural Publix and I'm using Publix in its plural form like unusually here but I'm doing so like very intentionally as it stems from this idea from John Dewey who maybe many of the green pill episode green pill listeners may or may not know but as a social thinker who talked a lot about this idea of emergent publics and emergent publics being these spaces that recognize the very complex and interweaving nature of the way that humans communicate with one another who come to you know come to form opinions and ideas around shared issues causes and interests and so we were we called these digital spaces plural publics as such and we can walk through like what these plural publics are how they are good design and how we envision building them as well so the way you can imagine plural Publix is first we have to make some like assumptions like one is like these things that I'm commenting about Foundation models and AI is going to be a reality that exists now that assumption is not too aggressive an assumption to make like I think it is very real to say that these information networks are going to be polluted and people are going to be looking for places to communicate in a way that they can have trust and they can verify information and so if you were to like imagine social networks today in a very like graphical structure as if anyone here is familiar with like how social networks analysis is heavily graphical in nature like when you study social theory social networks it's typically represented in a graph like structure you can imagine this so let me just interject for The Listener by graph you don't mean like a chart that you put in Google Sheets you're talking about like the graph where like you and I are both nodes and there's an edge between us because we're friends or I follow you and then you have your other edges out there so like you're talking about a a node Edge Edge sortograph right precisely yeah and so um I want you to imagine now that each node here in this graph is a given Publix again using it in its plural form intentionally and this publics can be anything that you define it to be it can be me and you it can be uh the green pill you know podcast Community it can be git coin it can be a basketball team it can be a group of friends whatever it is the key part of this Publix is that no matter what happens we preserve a boundary on that information being shared meaning if you try to go and share something we talk about no one else is going to believe that we even talked about that and so this is what's called deniable messaging so we get a communication platform that has deniable messaging amongst the participants in this group and so why is that important well it's important because if you cannot share information outside of the group then the information is preserves preserves its context only to the set of participants that are inside of this group and so I want you to imagine that we now have this group of people who we've agreed upon to be part of this like space and so anything we communicate in this space is only very like only able to be verified by the group of people in the space so if I try to share it with someone else I could but they may not believe me and the reasons why they won't believe me is through a various different Suite of cryptographic Primitives which are called designated verifier signatures and zero knowledge proofs which may be for the purpose of the podcast I don't know if we want to go into those um but broadly they are cryptographic techniques that allow us to preserve this form of deniable messaging in a zero knowledge fashion and so by doing so we basically get these social graphs that cannot spill information outside of their intended creation place and like now what we get is like let's say me and you do want to share something with another group so me and you are having this podcast we come up with a great idea and we want to go propose it to the get coin dial well I can't just go share it I need both of us to have consensus as to how we're going to share that information to another Publix and so we have these different governance models for how we share information and if we choose to share this information we then again use this primitive of a designated verifier signature to share it with the broader get coin dial and only they will be convinced that that information originated from both of us so it feels like yeah sorry so it feels like this is a tool for managing context collapse because personally consent to take something outside of your own public and into another public that you're in precisely and like there's a lot of like so this is like the general feel of how this works and we think that this is going to become a framework not necessarily this framework in itself but Frameworks like these are going to become the Frameworks for how humans will communicate as we start polluting our information structures and epistemic security which is like the words that's used for knowledge infrastructure epistemic security is at risk and so um it's our ability to preserve context that allows us to now have the appropriate set of people be convinced by information because right now our information graphs are very subject to like this leaky form of information sharing yeah and I feel like that there's this quote from Sam Harris that I love which is uh Nuance is the enemy of common understanding so the more nuanced to take gets the harder it is for people to understand and I think that that's probably because of context collapse when you're broadcasting to many publics all of which who have different understanding knowledges maybe even different languages then um you have to go for the least nuanced take if you want to hit the broadest possible uh engagement and so if we were to able to divide up our publics and only broadcast to people who we understood which common knowledge they have then it kind of it moves you away from this sort of thing where Nuance is the enemy of common understanding and you can't actually have meaningful com conversations because of that context collapse that feels like a pretty key problem to have solved although you know the other side of me is like well Venture and startups is all about networks and going as Broad and Blitz scaling as much as possible and so actually recognizing these plural publics and allowing us to be able to engage with them separately sort of goes against the VC acceleration list hyper hyper like so I guess I'm just wondering you know what will be the first killer app of floral Publix and and how do we support it um now that we know have the common knowledge that common knowledge is important in context collapse uh prevents that like it almost feels like we're going against the BC model when by trying to build something in that that way I I really do want to push to try to get into this mindset of like where are these Foundation models and AI is going to be to a point where that VC model no longer exists like you will no longer believe what a given VC or networking claim online says if we don't start to move towards techniques that I can even verify that this isn't the given venture capitalist that I'm supposed to be talking to the ability to basically falsify or Forge data whenever as it relates to Identity data is going to move to such a low cost to where deception becomes almost free right and so like it's under these conditions where I think that these VC models are going to need to adapt towards ones where it's I need to start communicating and networking and sharing information in a fashion where at least the recipients of this information can verify that it's in fact me and the ways in which I do that may not be exactly like the ways we do let's say um deniable messaging but it may involve some form of digital signature where people can can in fact verify that that claim is tied to my identity but what is my identity is it like a public address like treyjain.eath is my public address or maybe other people have their own public addresses that have a suite of interactions that may make it credible-ish to assume that that person is in fact the person that they're claiming to be but it's not too hard for someone to make like a stray jaw or whatever dot eath as well to have it and also very persuasive set of interactions on these given you know Dows or proposal making or whatever transactions I may need to make with a given Foundation model and so it's under these conditions where it becomes maybe even digital signatures are no longer sufficient and so I think it's under those scenarios where I think these types of communication flows like plural publics tried to propose are going to become much more uh necessary and the ways in which we're going about that may differ whether it's just like a typical digital signature deniable digital signatures and The Primitives we use whether it's like nfts verifiable credentials or even just basic Json like web tokens yeah it it's sort of quite interesting to play this all forward and and to think about how these things interact um I'm wondering how you think social media would be different at this point I mean social media there's a lot of sort of conniption here in 2023 about Twitter and lens protocol and forecaster and all these other sort of models for social media um is there any any sort of Trends in social media that you think are promising towards creating this future that you and Glenn Weil are envisioning yeah I definitely don't want to like out here like promoting different social platforms but I think like as an example I just like have so many of these different tools I've been trying on my phone so like on the top here I have Mastodon firecaster I have signal I have like I even tried like some of these apps that I don't actually use but I wanted to get an understanding of how people on them operate like true social and um even like trying to better understand how sub like insular groups communicate and like better understanding how the communication mediums that they use are and so what's interesting to me is like a reflection I've had is on Far Caster at least Dan Romero has done a very good job I think of having this like context-rich space where there's a certain type of you know um way of communicating on fire caster and like by definition is able to mitigate the types of people that are coming onto the platform because in order to be on the platform today at least you have to get a DM from from Dan Romero Mastodon like very similar to the one I'm part of is crypto Dawn by like Phil Diane's the the manager of that you know server at least and I think there's like again a necessity to move towards these like smaller circles and basically Fork off of like a baseline protocol and allow a set of people to communicate in these smaller circles is a model that I think we will start to see more of in this like very broad-based information sharing that Instagram and like mainstream Twitter have today will start to Decay an interest not because of anything else other than the ways in which we interact with information will become unusable and like basically unverifiable and therefore operating in this very low trust fashion and so I think the only ways in which people will start to use social media is if they can have this ability to verify and authenticate information which to me feels like is only possible in these like context-rich spaces because as an example like even me and you talking today I could be very much so empowered by an AI system right now in our conversation which is fine but what matters is that like the info like that AI should not deter the social norms of how me and you communicate like this this I myself may even be like an AI right now in a podcast with you in a future in a forward version of your podcast recordings so long as like that version of straight doesn't deter the social norms maybe that is a version of AI that like we're actually okay with but it's the minute that that starts to stray away from the Norms of these communication channels that it becomes quite dangerous actually and so as an example it's like how do we distinguish between an AI and a not AI the outputs like if you've if you've used the um openai has this API it's called like text classifier and you basically can put in outputs from a AI model into their classifier and it will give you a probability of AI or not and it it performs horrendously I've given it like direct outputs from Child GPT of like write an essay write a story or even the da Vinci models or other large language models and it can't determine what is an AI or not even from its own systems but what I think is very easy for humans to do at least is like if you start using regen or words that have a lot of context between me and you in a way that is Strays away from the Norms that we've established I can very quickly identify that you're probably not Kevin and you're probably someone else and maybe you're not in the eye but yeah so that's kind of why I see this like the tendency to more context-riched spaces being almost inevitable yeah well I mean it'd certainly be a more enjoyable conversation to be able to know the common knowledge of the circle that that I'm in and I think that we can that can sort of amplify itself though like having the more common knowledge um Within These circles and we can move away from this Nuance being the enemy of common understanding and I think this is a foundational part of coordinating and creating doing public goods funding in these ecosystems so that's that's pretty exciting to me as well yeah no precisely and I think it's um I think it's like that exact point where I think the web 3 community at least is a really great place to start experimenting with these tools because I think we see a lot of the experimentation with the social platforms at least with lens forecast or another where maybe there's like a real impetus now to go and try different things like let's try to attack this network with you know Foundation models and see how people's you know intuitions of what is real or what is fake changes and then how can we create tooling you know plural publics or other type of framework to combat that and then have that framework be one that others could benefit from as well yeah um can you say a little bit about how these plural publics relate to each other because one of the things I'm sort of wondering is you know if we're all a part of a dozen plural publics in what way are those plural publics um do they have overlap with each other and in what ways are they sort of in at war with each other because I think that there's sort of a lot of different thinking about this um depending on who you talk to and how you envision the future um whether we always have the right to exit uh and and and defect out of these plural publics and we're creating these smaller and smaller containers that don't have any interop with each other or if we're building this coordination across social distance where the plural publics are more cohesive with with with each other um I guess it's a long way of asking what polarization looks like with many plural publics yeah so it's a good question like I think I guess to be quite Frank is like this will also support very uh insular communities to become much stronger at doing the actions that they may want to take so if you're like a very um if you're like a radical radical group for example like this type of communication would help you coordinate on the outcomes that you're interested in coordinating on like that is just an outcome of improved coordination that has this like contact context Rich space that it may be unmoderated and allows people to participate in so let's take a very bad outcome of this um there is a lot of overlap though between the ways in which I as a user may participate in plural publics as like a social platform because I am participating in a conversation with you and that in itself may be its own Publix I'm also part of a basketball team I'm also part of and other communities of which I might be a subset like me being part of a basketball team might make me also part of this like basketball following group and like whatever that may be what's important is that I can always trace the provenance of information back from where it at least started and so like this conver this question of that you're asking of like right to exit versus like incentivizing voice the framework there is a bit different in that like it's we're not trying to say that we're trying to have people ask a question of whether or not they want the right to exit from a community or we want to rather incentivize voice it's rather much more like root level communication of like if you choose to communicate you communicate under these conditions in a way that yes you can obviously leave but there's also ways in which your voice is more heard as well in a way that um but I guess sorry to be clear if you do leave the information doesn't come with you because it's required that there's some governance mechanism whether it's majority vote quadratic voting whatever voting you want to say for that information to leave the group the group needs consensus and that also has a limitation to people who are oppressed by the group because people who are oppressed by the group may not able may not be able to take that information with them but there's mechanisms in place here to like allow that to happen under a certain set of conditions and like this is where the governance question comes into play with communication flows as well which is another big value out of the web 3 community and one that me and you have been talking about at least in in other ways yeah um I want to take a minute to sort of unfurl a theory that I have about public goods funding and and I'd love to just kind of Riff on it with you um I know we only have eight minutes booked I can go a few minutes over though I don't know if you can yeah I can go as well okay cool my next meetings got canceled which is which is great because I want to own a riff on this with you okay so um I'm gonna give this talk at each Denver basically laying out this Vision but uh I have this sort of hollonic uh view of how public goods could be funded in the future a whole lot is just basically um a group uh that is also a part of other groups um uh and so in that sense it's it like um I I'm a whole on because I'm a group of my own cells uh you're a whole on uh together us doing this podcast is a whole on because we're a group of two people the ethereum community is a whole on Microsoft is is a whole on um get coin is a whole on and so basically any any group of individuals that is a part of another group is is a whole lot and like up and down that stack is called a holarchy it's basically groups on groups on groups on groups um and and and basically one of the things that started to develop in my mind it's actually kind of funny to try to describe this Vision or uh on on audio because it's a very visual sort of vision is um a hollonic view of funding public goods so basically like in the ethereum community um the ethereum foundation uh ecosystem support program has traditionally been the main public goods funder in the ethereum community um and then get coin uh and quadratic funding was sort of like another way of sourcing funds and then Distributing funds inside of that whole on the ethereum community so you basically need a funding uh a funding sourcing mechanism and then you need a distribution mechanism to to figure out what the most important public goods in that ecosystem are you can stack multiple funding sourcing mechanisms and distribution mechanisms on top of each other and so just to continue the ethereum ecosystem example it's like the EF ESP which stands for ecosystem support program and then get coin grants and now there's retractive public goods funding and DOW drops and CLR phones and giveths you've got these like pluralistic funding mechanisms in these ecosystems and um and and so now you've got basically like these funding mechanisms that can be applied to any hold on and you can take these funding mechanisms that worked in ethereum and and do them in your own Dao or do them in your own community and um and so like as many holdons as exist uh that you can find funding for and you can do distribution for you're able to go up and down the stack of like not only web 3 Technologies and their Dows but also web 2 communities and then eventually like city-state public goods all using the same forkable open source code and the elegant thing about this is like what is a ecosystem development program in the early parts of the ecosystem is the same as a public goods funding mechanism that like quadratic funding is an ecosystem development tool for you when you're first building your ecosystem but it's way of rewarding the people who are providing those like public goods uh as as it matures and so that actually provides like a capitalist incentive to build this this model um of public goods funding mechanisms and so I guess what a that was like 90 seconds and maybe I'm belaboring the point but basically this holonic view of how we fund public goods to me fits very elegantly with what you're talking about with plural publics for you what you're calling a plural public I'm calling a hole on but the world in which we each have highly nuanced views of what's going on within our whole on or our plural public we're going to have better funding distribution mechanisms within that whole on and so I guess you know putting that all out there I guess I'm wondering if we riff a little bit on on how common knowledge in these hold on plural publics helps create public goods funding and what the implications are for public goods funding in in in both of these views which I find to be very compatible with each other so I know that was a lot but what's your reaction yeah well first of all the whole on concept I've just put it up on my screen here it's very interesting I always do love these uh mathematical or philosophical analogies that people can grapple on and I do like this whole long concept here um the intersection I see here being like very concrete is in order to be able to know how to fund public goods or What mechanisms make the most sense for a given Publix or hold on it requires the contextual understanding of the people composed of that whole lot and it also requires a very strong communication framework between those people to be able to come to consensus and coordinate on that given mechanism appropriately and so I think like the way I see this intersecting is like the way I see plural publics intersecting with I think many different uh areas of whether it be like funding communication coordination is that it improves communication outcomes in general like potentially a lot we haven't proved that we haven't proved that it's purely by uh Instinct and like assumptions and taking a lot of the social theory to underpin it but it um if if we can communicate better and we can communicate better in a way that allows stronger coordination outcomes then that means coordinating What mechanisms we use for what given hold on is also going to be determined much faster in a way that we can maybe experiment much quicker so like in this world that you're picturing right it's this world where we have this like ability to really plug and play with different mechanisms to a given context and like that's fine like like when you think about it today like we also have a lot of different mechanisms that we could adopt for voting to very rigid systems like the United States government or any any like nation state government but it's like the inability to coordinate effectively in a very context-rich space and it makes it very challenging so imagine now that you have like improved coordination outcomes and then you can like actually take this like tool set that you've built and actually start to like play with it because you have the improved coordination and contextual cues necessary to be able to do so so it feels like we have higher contacts and we're not suffering for context collapse so not only the selection of the mechanism but the implementation of the mechanism will be much higher context and therefore we get a higher resolution view of what public goods people actually care about um because we have common knowledge is kind of how I piece it together precisely precisely yeah well I am I am sort of curious to to see like you know right right now I think the public goods funding is a meme in web 3 and it's you know it's honestly thanks to vitalik caring about it that I think it's become a sort of hot hot thing to to to talk about but I'm really curious to see if and when the tools that are prototyped in web3 can be exported to the rest of digital technology um and you know the two examples that I'll give there are uh basically like web 2 open source packages anything in the PIP or npm ecosystems um and then but also companies companies that are more web too a company in a way is like a whole lot that is more gated than a digital ecosystem like a web three open source ecosystem and so in what ways could we create more democratic engagement of employees of companies of like these tech companies by using public goods funding mechanisms that are pioneered in web3 but then it also gets really cool from a Civic engagement perspective is taking things like quadratic funding and retroactive public goods funding and using them in local city-states I mean this is called participatory budgeting in local city-states and so you know in what ways can we combine funding mechanisms uh distribution mechanisms and common knowledge creation mechanisms and these different types of Hollands in order to fund public goods and you know as of course this is a podcast about regenerative crypto economics so it's all about revitalizing communities and creating more democracy and and like you know to me what's really cool is that is that is that we're sort of investing in common knowledge and common code bases in order to figure this all out and the momentum is only going to compound as more and more people join this movement so um yeah it's exciting yeah and I think like one other like to add on to that is I think that there's these different camps of thought in the crypto and AI ecosystems in particular which is like crypto argument against AI is like Singularity is bad therefore like decentralization is like a very big a very good thing we should strive for um and it's like maybe Singularity here or like the attack of such types of systems will actually be the Catalyst to like allow for decentralization as it relates to our communication and coordination uh flows and like I can see that having a very direct impact to cryptography and then when it comes to these like regenerative mechanisms maybe as we start to transform the the set of tools that we've been so used to as we're starting to see search starting to change which has been the same for the past 20 years but maybe search is going to transform due to these Foundation models maybe some of the other set of tool Stacks that were very like comfortable with using are now going to be subject to change due to the very real you know impact that these these Technologies are going to have and so I'm also hopeful that not just cryptography from like a digital signatures perspective but also these like regen mechanisms in the web 3 Community will also be of more interest to start adopting in the web 2 spaces yeah amen well um I I want to ask you uh a couple of closing questions I know that we're going over here so I'll move towards wrapping up but when we were talking about this episode we talked about uh the title for the episode and one of the ones that we considered was common knowledge is a foundation of love and I'm wondering if we can unpack that because I don't think that we've actually gone there uh yet in this conversation well I mean to give context to the listeners I don't know this if this part's releases at least is like today's Valentine's Day and so I think that's part of the reason why we had common knowledge as a foundation of love but I think there's like a real truth to that which is like when I think about maybe not love explicitly but I think a lot of the beauty at least of communicating with people who you're close with and the interactions you have with one another there's a much richer feeling in that communication with those people around you than there is with some arbitrary person in the public and it's like when you have contact with someone there's a much much more um there's a there's a feeling that comes with that right and so I think that common knowledge plays a big role in allowing us to have a strong understanding of these contextual cues and so I think that part of the play here like common knowledge is a foundation of Love yeah yeah well you know it's it's interesting because I think about the people that I love um you know my wife my kids my uh my community uh both the Boulder Community but also the online community and that common knowledge is sort of a byproduct of spending time together in that common understanding you know it's possible to go a little bit to like cerebral on this and just say like obviously common knowledge correlates with with love and I can just experience that empirically but it's kind of interesting to hear uh two very cerebral nerds on a podcast yeah with a priority reasons why common knowledge is a foundation of Love yeah no I love it I love it yeah well um that might be a good place to end but I I just wanted to give you the space and kisses anything I didn't ask that you want to tell us is there anything I didn't ask about common knowledge that you that you that you want to say or plural publics that you want to say no I I think that we had a very good discussion I think like um I'm excited but also a bit scared obviously of the impacts of the ways we communicate are going to happen that's going to happen over the next couple of years but I'm like also very hopeful to work with people both listeners of greenpill and others to to start working towards building these plural publics in a way that we can actually combat these epistemic threats in the very near future yeah the only way to go is forward and that's why I keep leaning into building these Technologies into building this this movement so yeah it's horrifying but uh what's what's the quote from Game of Thrones you're in the great game now and the great game is terrifying I feel that every day in the web 3 space there's only one way to go and that's forward yeah exactly and this existentialism is like both scary but also very helpful for moving the space forward as well yeah well um I hope that this podcast has created a little bit of a pocket of common knowledge and there will be common knowledge about why common knowledge is important and the there's a certain meta Loop of that that's exciting for me and Trey I just want to thank you for coming on the Pod and and uh enlightening us where can be we'll find you online yeah and most uh reachable on Twitter Jane East on Twitter and then you can also email me at treyjaineth gmail.com either of those work and yeah feel free to DM me anytime amazing well thanks so much Ray really appreciate it thanks foreign
