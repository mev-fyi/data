if you were a diabetic 50 years ago pigs would be slaughtered for food and the insulin in their pancreas would be sold to people who had diabetes Now your insulin it's human insulin but it doesn't come from humans we're not harvesting humans not in this country it comes from a process called fermentation the same process as we get from a craft brew well it turns out you can program that DNA now and that's what Genentech did they changed the genes so that instead of making alcohol they made enzymes that made insulin and so that's at its core What synthetic biology is about being able to read write edit the DNA and now you have this amazing production platform
