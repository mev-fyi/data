welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more Bagless guys this is an episode about uniswap about the uni chain about the app chain thesis that thesis plainly stated as every big defy app is going to have its own chain including uniswap that's what Dan elitzer says today how will this reshape crypto is the question where do we find Opportunities if Dan is right and does this thesis even make sense that's what we get into today a few takeaways for you number one we go through the case for why uniswap is going to have its own chain that is the thesis here we also go through the economic argument why Dan thinks there's an inevitable economic incentive for large D5 applications like uniswap to start their own chain we get into the true trading costs of using uniswap and who gets the revenue from these trading costs also objections to this app chain thesis we talk composability we top user user experience Dave and I have our own objections as well and then finally number four if the app chain thesis wins does that mean ethereum has to lose no maybe it depends that's the answer how about this whole competition between ethereum and Cosmos this is a recurring theme on Bank list that we get into a bit more today David why are we talking about this subject and uh what should listeners pay attention to in today's episode first Dan is using uniswap simply as the largest and biggest defy app on ethereum it's the one that produces the most blocks based demand it burns the most ether out of any other D5 app so he's not picking uniswap as a special case he's picking unit swap is simply because it's the biggest and the general thesis is the biggest the bigger defy app you are the bigger the defy app becomes the more likely it is that it will produce its own independent chain and so since uniswap is the biggest chain we're using uniswap as the thing to talk about as the the premiere example is why uniswap has the largest incentive to produce its own app chain but it's not the only one uh and the general theory is all defy apps when they hit a certain threshold will produce their own chain so that's first thing to look out for is like how do we measure that threshold what is that threshold how do we consider the incentives for D5 apps as they become larger to produce their own chain so that's the first thing to consider I think people should also just think about in what ways does this tilt the balance of power from eth the money to D5 token the asset how does that change that game and also just consider who wins here the Cosmos app chain or the ethereum layer 3 roll apps if you will and so I think those are the three main things to consider in this podcast of course uh premium Subs you can stick around after the episode David and I have a debrief episode where we talk about our thoughts on this episode it's our episode after the episode can I say episode again if you want that episode we actually become a premium subscriber uh David I've got some thoughts for you in that episode I'm not sure I wholly subscribe to the app chain thesis I think parts of it I identify with and it makes sense to me other parts I'm not sure sure about so I want to talk to you in more detail about kind of my uh my thoughts on what Dan presented today what do you want to talk about in the debrief I think the thing I want to talk about most is parse apart the different D5 app categories where some categories might be better suited for a sovereign app Chain versus some categories which might not be like I think there's an argument to make that dexes produce a stronger argument for an app chain than borrowing and lending protocols so Ryan I want to I want to dive in on that subject in the debrief of course the debrief is only for our

you to Dan elitzer a co-founder at nascent and I previously met Dan while he was also working at Ido collab Ventures and he's been on the frontier of crypto Innovations as long as I can remember Dan welcome back to bankless it's good to have you back thanks Dave it's always great to be here with you guys and so Dan you have a good track record of making very precise predictions that have I think basically all come true pretty closely to as described uh you wrote about the concept of composable collateral called superfluid collaterals what you call it in like February of 2019 and this was before a lot of defy apps really did Stitch themselves together uh and so you got that one uh you wrote about the Perils of liquid staking derivatives uh you've the article is called the death of ethereum the d-e-t-h of ethereum the delegated eth of ethereum two whole years before liquid was taking derivatives even existed uh now we are coming into ahead with some of those conversations today uh you also wrote about defy yield farming after you saw the writing on the wall not due to compound's governance token but due to an even earlier experiment uh from future swap in April of 2020 and so Dan your track record of very few but very precise uh articles has been really really strong and you recently wrote a new article titled uni chain is inevitable how a uniswap app specific chain is inevitable and this is I think not just a prediction for uniswap but for every single D5 app with sufficient activity on ethereum might produce its own app Centric chain so Dan that is the topic of today's show uh but first before we get into the show how do you feel about your track record like it's pretty damn good can you just reflect on it have you ever been wronged there I I've been I've been very wrong and I think you know I I've feel fortunate to have done a decent job calling out some Trends I I think the level of precision hasn't always been there um and one of the things that I tried to make clear in this latest piece is my degree of confidence is very high that app chains and app specific Roll-Ups someone actually shared the term roll app with me recently that I love wait um not roll up roll app roll app yeah I I loved that um but I'm very confident that these will be an important part of the ecosystem in the future I'm really bad at nailing timing uh so it I said you know it's probably about three plus years out till there's major major players um at the scale that we think of as like large l1s and such today that are happening via these application specific chains or Roll-Ups but it it seems inevitable to me that it is going to happen well I think we can definitely relate to that at bank list where at the top of the 2021 bull market we were all about Roll-Ups Roll-Ups Roll-Ups and everyone else was like all layer ones all layer ones all layer ones uh but now in the bear Market it definitely seems to be a Roll-Ups world uh so Dan as we go into this thesis I just want to ask uh you were you you titled the article why uni chain is inevitable saying like uniswap will eventually produce its own chain but this is not necessarily about uniswap we're just using uniswap as like a very like easy and obvious application to discuss while talking about the general idea of uh roll apps or app specific layer ones uh is that a fair summary Fair analysis yeah well I would say that it doesn't mean that all D5 apps are going to do this and as a number of people have pointed out there are some things like games that might have less benefits from composability especially Atomic composability within their application those may be the first ones to do it we just saw opcraft announced along with optimism and lattice working together on this and that's an example of kind of an application specific roll-up and I think that is something that seems very obvious where uh there might be a little bit of difference in opinion is how much this is applicable also to defy I believe it is very applicable to defy not necessarily every protocol or application in D5 but uh to many of them once they reach I would say some level of escape velocity it's going to become important that they have this as one of the tools in their bag it doesn't mean that uniswap or other applications will cease to have deployments and meaningful deployments on ethereum or optimism or arbitrum or any of these Roll-Ups or other chains it just means that there's a large incentive for them to consider making the place that they try to funnel users to the extents that they have a more direct connection with them and the ability to redirect them there they're going to want to migrate a significant chunk of the activity to their own roll-up or chain okay and just to really drive this point home you're not making this like sweeping blanket statement that every single defy app will produce its own chain no I think as we as listeners go through this episode and and kind of hear some of the arguments and Theses and motivations uh listeners might be able to decide for themselves like at some point some defy app using this model that we're about to talk on this podcast the the incentives might like tip over to like okay now now with these incentives if you like take everything into account the incentive to produce an app role app or app specific layer one uh will become significant and this is the kind of the Nuance unpack here yeah and one of the analogies I like to use here is looking back at some web 2 platforms like look at Zynga um doing Farmville and other games on Facebook as a platform and um uh digital King Digital games and folks like that they were paying these huge taxes and they were very much at the whims of the platform they were on that was not just trying to optimize for game playing was trying to optimize for a whole bunch of different types of users and use cases and there was a large tax then Associated also with being active on these platforms and so the smart game Publishers started saying okay how can we move and do a native mobile app how can we do a web app how can we more directly own this relationship with the users and avoid certain types of platform risks and platform taxes and we're seeing that play again with certain again game Publishers and some streamers and others who love the distribution of the App Store and the Google Play Store early on but once you've gotten to a certain size you have a certain amount of economic activity a certain number of customers who highly value your application you're going to necessarily look to say how do I reduce the the take rate that some of these other platforms are charging me and how do I ultimately maintain better control over the user experience so that I can better deliver to my users into my community okay so what's interesting is we're starting to get into the the why the economics of why and I want to return to the kind of that the uniswap example because this is a really interesting example you you pick but before we do that every thesis has to have a prediction obviously that can be either validated or invalidated and if this is maybe something we're calling kind of the the app chain thesis if you will or prolapse or this the world of layer ones either the cosmos world or the ethereum world something like that or maybe some combination of both um what does that mean exactly like what is the prediction on the other side so you said just now Dan that it doesn't mean every single defy thing app will roll its own app chain but I think it probably does mean we will get um we are maybe in your opinion entering a new era kind of an app chain era where these things will be much more common maybe as common as D5 apps were on on on layer one maybe even more common what are kind of the the prediction of the app chain thesis how how can we tell if you're actually right you know two years from now Dan about this yeah uh I I would say you know you guys did a fantastic conversation with sunny and Zaki uh the other week uh talking about the cosmos ecosystem and and how that is developing I think if we start to see more people using Cosmos chains I don't know what the kind of user numbers are that we want to put on this or uh you know maybe uh I hadn't actually thought about quantifying this in a way that is falsifiable but if we see something like uh the top five highest user count or highest volume D5 applications if in five years the top five all have a sovereign chain as something that they have launched uh and is active then I would say this has played out it does not necessarily mean the majority of the activity attributable to say uniswap or compound or somebody like that is necessarily all happening on that chain but that it is a core component of their strategy and of their economics so that would be a paradigm shift and let me make sure I understood you uh correctly so you put some time ranges on that five years or something but like you're envisioning a world where we go to like coin Gecko and we look for the top defy apps right and you know the top say five defy apps all have their own chain and that chain could either be something in the cosmos world where it's kind of a layer one mesh Network side chain type of thing or it could also be a a roll app which is kind of like an ethereum secured roll up that also has some of its own sovereignty and is kind of its own chain and if that's also larger part of the ethereum layer 3 narrative so roll apps and layer threes are largely synonymous so just to put that into listeners heads and so if we see that Dan that would be like okay and and that's a big paradigm shift because right now when we envision like okay it's you know I don't know what are the top five defy uh tokens right now it's like or usage it's like uniswap you know lend mkr um what you're predicting is all of these will have their own uh app chains essentially yes yes I think the prediction is like at the bigger that they get the more likely they are to produce a chain yes yeah let's dig into that and I uh I think the the example that you select is actually really good example in uh you're actually going for the big one which is uniswap and the thing I like about uniswap as an example is that I think it's our purest representation of defy at some layer right it's like it's very much on chain it's you can easily see something like dydx with kind of an order book that needing its own sort of order book app chain but like uniswap having its own app chain and that that that is a tough one uh it's hard for people to wrap their minds around it's also very interesting in that it's like a um the highest usage highest volume biggest defy app that we have and also I would argue that um it requires a lot of composability doesn't it I mean you have to have all of these erc20 tokens and other D5 apps kind of like um uh interacting with it in some way and so you you've picked off a really hard one in order to prove your case but the case I think starts with economics and that this to me like I always like the economic arguments because those are the arguments that always tend to be like sticky regardless of people's opinions um can we start here though because you start your post and you talk about the three costs to trading on uniswap uh there's a swap fee cost to LPS which I think people are um like people notice there's also this transaction fee cost to validators which is kind of like a gas fee and there's also Mev can you talk about those three buckets of costs and trading on uniswap and how the economics kind of converge to incent and a defy app like uniswap to pursue the app train model sure well the the first cost the kind of swap fees that's something that if you look at token terminal or any of these tracking sites that's always emphasized as kind of like the the revenue whatever from the protocol this is actually trading fees but it's in some ways it's actually not uniswap has framed it as a you know initially 30 basis point fee and others from day one but if you think about it it's really uh enforcing a spread because it's not being extracted by a third party but everybody calls it a fee so let's let's take it as a fee that's the place where the fee switch literally that we call it in uniswap is positioned to be able to take a slice of those uh kind of swap fees so that's that's what people have typically thought of the universe of this is these are the cost Traders pay and this is where if uni token holders want to kind of capture any value here they would flip the fee switch and take a piece of that importantly it's the it's what uniswap has control over so like while there's Nuance here like is this revenue for the unit swap protocol well no it's Revenue actually for the liquidity providers but the unit swap protocol has control over it and so that's why we've kind of like lumped it together as like this is uniswap revenue right right then the next piece is actually the uh transaction fee right the the ethereum transaction fee where you're paying gas to get a a transaction confirmed included on the ethereum blockchain and that has been a very significant piece and the analysis that I was able to do um was kind of looking at doing dashboards and other things that I could find and it was easier for me just to to look at kind of the the mean trade uh data rather than looking at median um and obviously for smaller trades the fixed fee associated with making that that trade that transaction is going to be a much larger piece of it uh there are some very large trades that I um my understanding is that it has skewed up what we look at as the average trade size but you have a pretty similar a portion of the fee being paid by a Trader going in the form of this fixed transaction fee now if you comp that to a centralized exchange if you're trading on coinbase or FTX or anywhere there's no fixed fee you're paying just that kind of variable you know percent of your transaction that is being charged by The Exchange there's no fixed fee saying you want to trade one dollar or one million dollars you're still going to pay a five dollar fee or a 50 Cent fee that just doesn't exist in a centralized exchange world and it's very economically inefficient if you're looking at it just through the lens of a Trader and so that is a a meaningful component I would say especially during the the bull market that we saw um you know in in 2021 there was uh I would say for smaller Traders often they're probably a lot of Trades that didn't happen because you were seeing the majority of the trade costs of the trade size even get eaten up in a transaction fee just to get that that fee on chain um and it fluctuated so much so having this uh I would say like fixed fee that's irregardless of trade size there is a fee but also having that very in the size based on the activity going on on ethereum overall that's really bad ux uh and it represents a a huge cost paying by Traders uh being paid by Traders that could be controlled better through the use of a roll app or or app chain and we'll we'll talk about how uh how a roll app or app chain can actually produce more control by the actual app um uh later on then show but really just to emphasize this we've talked about two costs so far the 30 basis points cost that you want to swap the app charges to go to unit smart provider to liquidity providers which you can swap controls and that's considered revenue for the protocol the next cost that we've talked about is the gas fee cost and you're saying just like the that's outside that's external to the unit swap protocol that's something that ethereum kind of loosely controls uh and and says and kind of dictates to uniswap you must pay this in order for a transaction to go through and the chart that Ryan was showing on the screen just a second ago showed that in like over 2021 that costs range from ten dollars to eighty dollars and you're you're taking this uh example and saying eighty dollars compared to you know what you would charge uh what coinbase or FTX charges you is like insane uh and like an 80 transaction fee on a trade trade like you need to be doing something that's trading something like larger much larger than like a thousand dollars for that to be just like economically viable or cost competitive with other exchange mechanisms uh and so you're saying this fixed cost that comes externally to uniswap uh has prevented a significant amount of trading activity happening during this time of high gas fees and is just like overall bad ux and bad economics for uniswap the app is that a good summary of where we are so far that's a great summer of where we are so far um and now I assume you want to get to that third one that's it's a very hot topic these days around Mev or maximal extractable value uh so this is something that is currently being captured uh by some combination of Searchers who are kind of going in there and extracting value of the Mev um and validators and ultimately uh if holders right to the extent with 1559 that we're now seeing a lot of uh fee fees Burns um you know a lot of this well to be fair the fees are getting burned anyway the a lot of the values then you know being paid to uh validators for inclusion in these Mev blocks um but there's multiple types of Mev and the analysis I did was a very rough very very rough I'm 100 sure it is wrong um I just hoped to get it within effectively an order of magnitude um the analysis that I based it off was done by Xerox that was looking at effectively sandwich attacks which are when you're trading on uniswap or another decks and you have some sort of slippage tolerance that you include there in your transaction and you say you know basically have this trade fail if the price moves outside of these bounds and what these Searchers are doing that are doing these sandwich attacks is they are pushing uh the price they're basically taking your your transaction that you've broadcast into the public mempool and they're putting a transaction in front of it to push the uniswap pool price just to the very edge of what will allow your transaction to go through uh having you execute that like high the highest price you want to tolerate and then they're putting other transaction afterwards to kind of like move it back so they're essentially atomically doing an Arbitrage here where you as a Trader are getting a worse price and they are capturing the difference between what you thought you were going to pay and the most you stated your willingness to pay now that is just bad for Traders right Traders lose um you swap customers lose and so that's not good there's all but that to be fair is not the majority likely of Mev and we've seen as was mentioned by by Sunny um on the osmosis decks right on on Cosmos um and kind of Cosmos ecosystem they're partnering with skip protocol to look at another type of Mev which is just back running which is just saying like look you've you've made this trade we're not going to front run your trade and give you a worse price but we will back run it and balance that across pools potentially across other venues uh to capture an Arbitrage opportunity that exists as a result after you've made your trade and there is a huge amount of opportunity there and talking to people far smarter than myself there is a large consensus that that is probably the vast majority of Mev exists there and it's not harmful to users but it's a revenue opportunity to be captured um so for the purposes of costs we really want to look at kind of sandwich watching a malicious Mev and that's also a significant cost but as we're talking about Mev I just want to emphasize we'll go back to that later the revenue possibilities around the non-malicious Mev that is still kind of thrown off as a byproduct of trading on the stacks so so to parse that apart there's two parts of Mev there's malicious Mev that like Jade's customers and is bad for them and then there's Mev that is universally accepted as like this is good and efficient and just like a rational Arbitrage opportunity that doesn't Jade customers and that part can be made significant and also in the ethereum composability layer one context it's hard to prevent the malicious Mev from happening as well yeah it's it's not impossible there are are ways to go about it I've I've heard some some very smart ideas that have not been put into production yet but uh a lot of it gets easier to control on a roll app or or app chain okay so um let's talk about and just summarize this for folks um what the costs are for each of these three areas that you mentioned and then kind of who gets the money so what the costs are is kind of what the customer of uniswap pay so I mean you just swap Trader I just want to swap one asset for another right and so we have the swap fees what does that look like if we're to translate that in terms of a percentage of trade or basis point that can range but what's kind of an average uh size there for the for the swap fee the first category we're talking about yeah so uh the average size we're looking at there I believe was around like 17 basis points so uh 0.17 of the average trade got it and that's because some pools are have a very uh small fee of like zero point uh zero one percent other pools have a one percent and you're saying the average is about point one seven percent for fees a customer will pay for like the swap fees themselves correct and then the transaction fees when you've looked at that just at a high level I know you know know these numbers should be uh yeah about 23 and a half basis points so point two three five percent um it was the average that I'd looked at over from like it was like June to June uh from like 2021 to 2022. okay so we have um Point um or we have 23 basis points and we have 17 basis points you add that together and we're starting to get a picture of the cost and how about the third category the Mev category uh how many basis points does that cost a customer and and again this is by far the the roughest one that I don't have a lot of confidence in this but the very very back in the napkin math that I was doing on the malicious Mev here was around 25 basis points okay so actually the and again my degree of confidence not super high there but saying that is roughly it's it's at least in line if not greater than each of the other two types of costs wow okay so if you add all of that up and recognizing that the first two categories those are fairly strong predictions like we can kind of see that in the date and we already get to you know 41 basis points there so that's 0.41 on a trade if you add Mev based on Dan's estimates we get to um 0.66 of every trade so over half a percent of every trade customers actually paying in fees and so let's just Benchmark this um across fees uh in the exchange World for for example so a competitor UNIF swap is maybe centralized exchange so what is a coinbase or a kraken or a gemini or a insert your favorite exchange here FTX uh that's not my favorite I don't have favorites uh but uh whatever exchange you wanted what's the range of fees for for for their trades yeah so it depends if you're going through the brokerage or going straight uh it's more the advanced trade mode um with the exchange uh coinbase has been it might be somewhat notorious for continuing to charge about one percent uh fee to retail Traders for many years but I if you go um to actually trade on an exchange uh usually you're talking anywhere from like 10 to 30 basis points 10 to 30 basis points versus 0.66 uh or 0.6 yes 0.66 percent or 66 basis points so um it's more expensive to do something on uniswap yeah which you know to be fair right we know that doing things in a decentralized manner is more expensive right there are costs to the decentralization to the censorship resistance that we're getting here uh but there there are ways that we can reduce some of these costs while still maintaining the the values and the uh aspects of composability and censorship resistance that we value so highly right so we're paying maybe a little bit more in some cases um but of course we get this decentralized unit swap system as a as a customer isn't that a glorious thing has this long tail of assets that you couldn't find anywhere else and um a host of other benefits that D5 brings now let's talk about the other side of the ledger so who actually gets that money right um the first category back to the swap fees um the uniswap protocol is getting the money but it's also Distributing that to different like sides of the market a portion to LPS and then maybe hypothetically a portion back to uh governors of the uni token although that's not in place yeah how do you think about that first off the who gets the swap fees piece yeah I mean it's it's going to LPS but again that makes it more like a spread so but from a Trader's perspective kind of coming in it it certainly feels like a fee versus the kind of like quoted price here but from the protocols perspective does the it's it's not something like it's something that I guess the protocol gets and can manage versus the other two categories and this is maybe where the distinction is for transaction fees that's extra outside of the uniswap protocol right that is back to the ethereum protocol and same with Mev so maybe a distinction I thought was useful here and Dan you tell me what you think about this was the swap fees go to the uniswap protocol in some way for it to distribute it has autonomy over that has sovereignty over that they go to where uniswap wants it to go right right but the transaction fees and the Mev fees go to this other protocol which is called the ethereum protocol and eventually these fees of course go to Ether validators you know critics of ethereum would call these the uh the feudal Lords the evil like uh rent collectors they pay rent to the eath holders yeah yeah is this an accurate framing of things what do you think uh I mean to some degree sure that I I would say uh there's also a lot of benefit right uniswap wouldn't exist without ethereum um and today I'm not advocating that uniswap go try to launch a uni chain today and make that a big strategic Focus for themselves I still think there's a lot that needs to be built but um yeah there's a lot of fees being paid but they're being paid for a service that's being provided right is this kind of like a to me this just seems like tax right so it's basically I live in a nation state I choose to register my uh LLC in Delaware I'm in the U.S I'm based in a particular state I'm in this country because it provides a set of public goods which includes like um defense for example a you know a court system a settlement layer all of these benefits I get by being in the system so I pay a tax on all of the earnings from my LLC is this kind of the model and why do I do that because like I can't just go found my own country I can't like for my for my company I can't like get all of this infrastructure out of the box so I choose to live in a in a nation state or maybe there's no other option for people other than to live in a nation state but um at some level these are kind of like public good taxes that uniswap pays and so they're paying validators and they're paying kind of the Mev Builders which in efficient market a lot of that goes to to validators they're paying attacks for these Services provided to them by the ethereum network and so is the real question to all of this in the app chain thesis are the taxes we pay worth the services that we get from the public network is that the question I think that is a good high-level framing of the question um and while you know we can kind of debate elements of that within each of these different costs I think at a high level that's absolutely right and one of the Beauties in this system that we are collectively building uh in the crypto ecosystem the web 3 ecosystem this open Financial ecosystem it's the ability to exit and to opt out and so there is this kind of free-flowing nature where there is not lock-in uh that you must stay always paying taxes paying fees to the same platform you can migrate and because we are building these standards these connections these Bridges these ways to interoperate across different blockchains across different roll-ups it's going to be possible to not leave all your users behind but to bring them with you uh to a new place that you establish based on the roles that you've collectively determined you want to set and hopefully if you've done this well right users will follow activity will follow and you'll actually grow and be even larger in this new home that you've created for yourself but you don't have to give up the old one the nice thing one of the many nice things about ethereum right and the way that as you pointed out uniswap is in some ways like uh the the best example we have of true defy in that the contracts aren't meaningfully upgradable other than flipping a fee switch they will just keep running as is as long as the ethereum blockchain is is running and so you still get that and if people see the value there and for certain types of activities it's still makes sense to pay those taxes to the ethereum network to have uniswap natively deployed there and be used there people will keep paying those uh but you you now can kind of segment out the user base and say for people who don't necessarily value as highly the atomic composability uh with other applications on ethereum that really what you want to be doing is doing a lot of permissionless trading you want to do a relatively high volume of trading you don't want to pay a lot of like fixed transaction fees on this you want to maybe get a rebate on some of that Mev you want to have tighter spreads better price execution on your trades as just a a retail Trader great there's going to be a place that you can do that too that's going to be familiar it's going to be under the same brand that you're that you're dealing with like there there's so much that can happen there it's just a new additional option for what I believe is a very very large customer segment it may not be the largest segments in the users who are here who are using a swap today although I believe it probably is but I am very confident that will be the case for a lot more users in the future the people who are not using defy yet who are still stuck on centralized exchanges and who still value it nascent is a very D5 forward uh fund and and group of Builders we still do a lot of our trading on centralized exchanges because the execution is just much better there um and it would be amazing we want to do more of our trade volume in defy and systems like this enable it to be cost competitive while still getting us the great ux that is possible in doing

like to your point it's not that uniswap is necessarily like um you know changing jurisdictions moving from the U.S to say like Ireland or something for you know better tax advantage status it's more like they're keeping a office in the U.S and they're also expanding into Ireland and opening up another office there but I think that the question on kind of like this idea of taxes for public good is is kind of also a question of like have you thought abstractly as to what does a uniswap user or the uniswap application itself get in exchange for those taxes so it's paying for those taxes what is it getting a few things that come to my mind are obviously settlement guarantees the decentralization of ethereum also Network effect um I think there is a reason my co-host David moved to New York City from the West Coast in San Diego and uh you know I've heard him say this before so I don't think I'm putting words in his mouth it was because of the network it's because of the people uh that live there kind of the opportunities it was just like shout out my friends oh yeah like a better he wanted to be co-located with um a specific network of people right and so that can be an advantage to um like where where you live right you don't want to like um move your your company out in kind of like you know rural somewhere I don't want to offend any any any particular place but um like you want to be where the network effect is and where the customers are so that could be another reason are those reasons for why to pay the public taxes and when you think about this uh abstractly why do you think defy applications are paying taxes to validators and paying the mevs why haven't they already gone and launched their own app chains uh yeah well I think one of the reasons is as you said just it's where everybody else is and you lose a lot by going remote um in in this case right if you're trying to set up if David was literally trying to go off and set up his own city right that's going to be a pretty lonely place at first but we have this what'd you call your city David well there's David you can create these yeah there you go uh dandel's gonna have to come over and visit sometime um so uh there's the ability right because we we have this digital ecosystem right there's not as much of the the physical friction the physical world friction that we that we see when you're talking about like moving but over time that's gonna it's gonna get even less right right now there is still a lot of friction spinning up your own chain having your own validator set making it interoperable with different wallets allowing people to bridge freely and easily and at low cost um the infrastructure isn't there and that's why I I'm saying this is going to take three plus years to be a major like economically relevant Trend I think we're still we're seeing already a lot of chains launch in the cosmos ecosystem especially I think polka dot and Avalanche and others are seeing it Celestia is doing it like all all these others are trying to enable more of these Sovereign chains but the infrastructure isn't there yet uh to allow people to move and have a reasonably approximate user experience so right now yeah you're going to pay those taxes because going off and setting up something different and getting the benefits of uh I I would guess a vertical stack for these applications for these defy applications it just isn't there yet um and so it makes sense to pay the ethereum tax and if we've seen actually a lot of teams a few teams in Nathan's portfolio and then a number of other teams that we've we've talked to who we're launching on Solana initially or other chains initially and are like actually we need to come to ethereum because in the current marketing conditions like ethereum is really where all the the activity still is happening and so they want to be there and so there is this kind of almost migration into the city center for now um and I think that at some point we will see this uh I would say loosening of the boundaries around the city center and it will be able to grow and people will be able to have the experience of being in the city center or very very close to it without having to pay the taxes of the city center because we've built out all this ancillary infrastructure that enables you to get the vast majority of those benefits while still controlling your own vertical stack I I really like this metaphor and I think there's a lot to unpack here we keep using this word taxes and it's one way to illustrate what's going on but I think it's incomplete and it also might put just a bad image into users heads like oh taxes those nation-state things that we're trying to get away from it's just one way to describe this and I actually if you're paying for services right it's not it's not taxes right you're paying for services right you you can choose to pay them or not and if you don't want them there are other places that will offer you a service that clearly there's less demand for if it's provided somewhere else then if it's provided by ethereum and some people it's not going to throw you in jail for Quality yeah but but also like I think a better perhaps or at least a different way to illustrate this is just costs of living right and so like I moved from San Diego to New York uh close to Manhattan the cost of living have gone up and that is kind of the same thing that we're calling taxes in this one metaphor so like maybe if you don't like the taxes word you can replace that with costs of living and now that I now that there's this Manhattan Place Place everyone wants to be here there's only limited Supply there's much more demand rent is high restaurants are high and like so uniswap has this line out the door and it's like Manhattan location and so uniswap has this like downtown Manhattan like Embassy of sorts and there's a big line out that door because because we're all in Manhattan and that's where all the people are and so naturally the uniswap location in Manhattan has a large amount of demand for it amongst and it's also right next to compound it's also right next to Ave it's also right next to maker Dow so the subway system to get to these places are very congested because everyone wants to go here and so like yeah one way you can call it taxes is also we can also call it just generalized costs of living is really high in New York but people pay that because it's fun to be here right it's fun to be on the ethereum layer one it's where all the rides are it's where all the lines are but Dan you're saying that like okay so uniswap can keep its Embassy its location it's its headquarters on the ethereum layer one in downtown manhatt patent on Times Square and it can also go and build out its own goddamn country elsewhere it's like wow there is so many there's so much demand to use uniswap we can keep our Embassy on the ethereum layer one we can keep our app on the ethereum layer one we will also build out our own City our own nation and there will there's a sufficient demand there's proven sufficient demand of uniswap in Manhattan that if we build out this new nation state this new country this new security system called the uniswap app roll app or or app chain that we know that actually there's going to be sufficient demand of both the uniswap chain the uni chain and the uniswap app on the layer one uh and we can actually have both Best of Both Worlds and you talked about how at nascent uh you guys actually still use centralized exchanges to me this like roll app model of uniswap is somewhere in the middle of just like the application and on the ethereum layer one and a centralized exchange where like if you fund your account on the uni app chain you get some of the very strong execution abilities of a sovereign role app that can compete with FTX and coinbase and so um and so it starts to feel like a a like a blockchain that's meant to do one thing which is compete very very strongly on execution uh that doesn't have to compete with the execution of all of the nearby applications like maker of a compound and so this like Embassy on the ethereum layer one model in this very high High Cost of Living of the ethereum layer 1 slash Manhattan versus like uniswap building out its own like city state out in The Burbs or just like I don't know terraforming some land in the Pacific Atlantic Ocean uh if you want to really stretch that metaphor I I think this is really really a useful mental model would you add anything to this to this perspective I think that's great and I think one of the the reasons why it's going to take some time to get to that future is because right now you if uniswap were to go set up its own like city-state nation state you need to have an airport and you're gonna need to like go there and it's going to take hours to fly there and it's just it's a real hassle and getting anything else there is just going to be a pain and the future that we are heading to is it's going to be more like teleportation and so it is not exactly the same as walking next door to compound but it's gonna be pretty close and I think you know while there may be some some cost to getting there I think those costs are are going to get fairly low um and it's not going to seem as far away and as different right again Cosmos has you know talked for a long time about like the inter chain and thinking about this as like we're gonna have a network of networks is really what the future is going to be here and you know I'm I'm a deep believer in ethereum I love the ethereum ecosystem that is where the vast majority of the teams that I work with um are are operating today but I do think that we're not going to be in a future State five years from now where as we as I think we've all acknowledged right where the majority of activities can be happening on ethereum L1 at the very least we're going to move to l2s we're probably going to have these l3s other l1s and their ecosystems are not going to go away they're still going to be there we'll probably see you know some amount of uh I would say concentration within within a handful of other economically relevant um blockchains but you're going to be very limiting if you're only thinking you're going to work in the purely ethereum-centric universe and consumers are going to want to be able to access all of this and so we are going to build better Bridges better ux in moving between different chains different execution environments um and I just view that as effectively inevitable um and it's I believe that we're going to get there on a technological front um and get close enough there are going to be places where maybe there are certain trust assumptions that are going to be introduced but at the very least those will be transparent and people can choose to accept them or stay in what they view as a more fully trustless environment they're going to be able to bridge all over the place this is just what if we want to compete with web 2 if we want to compete with tradfi like we're gonna need to grow and be more accepting and adopt the idea of people operating across a broader ecosystem than just ethereum so okay um can you make sure we're kind of grounded in this economic question so I think the economic case that you're making for why uniswap would leave kind of an embassy on main chain but then ex expand to an app chain is because on the app chain that's a roll up a roll up app chain or its own kind of self-sovereign app chain it can basically reduce the um the trading costs down from like what did we say earlier 0.61 0.66 percent basis points it can reduce that down and or if if it doesn't reduce that it can also just collect its own rent right and and it's almost like a game so why would a uniswap move to get more customers to drive down the cost per trade in a new app train and to collect more Revenue itself rather than paying more in like taxes to etholders essentially like these are the economic drivers for this and and like this all exists in kind of like a multi-party game you know theoretic construct where if they don't do it then their competitor will and so this you know almost forces them to do it in order to remain competitive and this is kind of the world the world that you're painting uh am I getting that correct right am I getting that part correct and then also like what new sovereignty do they gain other than the kind of the economic argument for why they might move what new sovereignty do they gain in an app sheet model that they didn't have on ethereum layer one yeah that's great question so one of the things that I think is really exciting here is the ability to tweak where the costs sit right I think we would all agree that you can't have zero cost transactions on a blockchain right there needs to be some cost associated with a transaction so there's going to be some fixed fee is that you know seven dollars the right amount like probably not for a lot of use cases 70 cents seven cents point seven cents 0.07 cents I I don't know where that is relative to the uh I would say the variable cost on those swap fees and so when you have your own roll up or your own chain you can kind of with those to figure out what is the right well setting that you need um there's a great experiment uh in uh Kanto um that is looking and saying hey like what if we actually have native dexes and um uh you know native lending protocol and things like that um how do we actually build that into the validation for the for the chain or for for the zone and you're able to redistribute fees in different ways so one of the things that I'm most excited about here is looking at that Mev right that's going out to these kind of third parties uh in a lot of ways what if we take a piece of this which is part of kind of effectively skips proposal what they're doing with with osmosis and saying well we can now redirect what happens with some of this Mev Revenue that was being captured by other parties we can take it we can actually rebate it to Traders we could uh rebate it to LPS or we can capture it within the the Dao and use it to fund future developments and so you get access to this whole new piece of Revenue that you can use to tighten spreads reduced fixed trading costs or fund future development like that's incredible the amount of I would say like economic tweaking you can do there to make the best trading environment and also to ensure the health and development of the protocol in the long term the same way that we look at um exchange a centralized exchanges play with essentially maker taker fees right where they say how much do you pay for a fee if you post an order versus you you take an order off the order book and even to the point of like creating negative fees for market makers in some cases we're gonna like a rebate we can start to do that in a decentralized context by looking at this other Revenue flow that isn't strictly part of the kind of pricing baked into the amm formula itself so you get full control over all of the revenue flows and how you allocate that yeah yeah and very simply put like why the why the inevitability of uniswap of the uni chain uh why that exists the unit is the raw inevitability of it is because the uni chain will be able to capture more revenue for itself while simultaneously being able to produce better execution for its customers and better fees likely for their liquidity providers so it's a win-win win all right well who loses in that in that scenario well it's the etholders actually and it's the malicious Mev Bots uh and so uh some would say that this is this is good this is this is good for the uniswap app chain uh and so like uh just kind of recapping the numbers unit swap LPS get 17 basis points that's 26 of all the total costs of transacting on the unit swap on on uniswap layer one from from your numbers Dan uh then The Ether burn is 23 basis points that's 35 of all costs on unusual and then there's Mev Arbors which is 25 basis points about 38 of all costs trading on your swap you're saying we can eliminate the youth Burn by putting all of those transaction fees onto its own independent app chain where unit swap might even collect those own transaction fees that's good for the uniswap uni token in theory the unisop protocol uh Mev Arbors call it you know very roughly 50 bad 50 good you eliminate the bad stuff and that can also be recirculated back to either better execution for customers better revenue for liquidity providers which then creates better liquidity which is a good service to customers uh or can this also be a fee collected by the uniswap token uh and so just the net of it is is that the control that uniswap has allows it to just overall like cut out the middleman like quote unquote cut out the rent paid etholders and since it can control its own execution because it's his own blockchain it can also determine the Mev that is good and emphasize good Mev while eliminating bad Mev and so the net of it is is like uniswap produces its own domain which I can like optimize for the best possible version of itself the only cost is you actually have to get there you actually have to move your assets over to that chain this is a good summary yeah well one one thing that I will add here is I think based on you know ing but personally and also through public statements like members of the uniswap team like these are folks who are very aligned with ethereum as an ecosystem and the ethos here and one of the the pushbacks that I often see around app chains is that people are assuming you're going to go and have a completely Sovereign validator set um and I think that's that's very unlikely to be the case for uniswap especially like they're I would be shocked if they didn't tie back into ethereum via some sort of like roll up um I think you know they're they're very friendly with the optimism team obviously one of the early kind of launch Partners there and so I would very much expect them to still be uh relying on ethereum for some amount of their their shared security and to make sure that the bridges to ethereum are especially strong of any of the ecosystems so I don't think that you know ethereum would you know totally loses out here and again literally even if like you just want token holders wanted to vote for it you can't shut down uniswap on ethereum it will always be there one of the costs that I see of the unit swap train I think some listeners might be like oh I totally see how uni chain is inevitable this sounds great like better win-win-win uh but I think one of the cost to highlight of the uni chain uh the the something you lose is composability uh and so I think to make this very reductive is that there's better execution on uni chain it can compete with something like coinbase or FTX on execution because it has that it has higher levels of control but what it gives up is composability and so if you want composability you go back to Manhattan you go back to the ethereum layer one and you ultimately uh pay you pay that's what you pay for that's why why you pay ethereum you pay ethereum for composability that's ultimately what you get from uh like paying eip1559 the East burn what's your take here uh I think you give up certain types of composability so you're giving up Atomic composability where all these different things you want to do are happening in the exact same transaction are all you know essentially settling simultaneously I think that that has been and the a lot of what I talked about with like super fluid collateral and others like we're based on that but it doesn't necessarily there's a lot of activity a lot of composability that's important that doesn't have to be purely Atomic so for one example right one of the things that I I talked about in superfluid collateral was the ability to take uniswap LP shares and then use them as collateral in a lending protocol so let's say you have LP shares on uni chain you could Bridge them over to compound chain and still post them as collateral you still get that composability one of the things you don't get there right is like say using flash loans uh to facilitate Liquidations in a lending protocol right things like that um and it swaps like that that gets um a little trickier right certain types of atomic composability but when we talk about the benefits of composability in crypto I think a lot of it is just it's in some ways like these open apis and the ability to take assets anywhere you can have a wallet they can make transactions on multiple chains um you've got uh this is a nascent portfolio company but socket which is being used as the kind of bridge provider in the coinbase wallet app today for kind of polygon and ethereum they're creating this new class of effectively super apps where they're really abstracting away a lot of the uh challenges on the developer side and the user side around deployment on multiple chains and managing liquidity across those change chains so um I guess what I'm getting at here is like you don't necessarily give up you don't period Give Up composability by moving to another chain you give up a certain type of composability that we have gotten used to thinking about over the past however many years in ethereum as being what composability means but it's not it's a it's a specific very valuable type of composability but I would posit that in the future 80 plus of the benefits that we think of as composability like we still get those even with different chains so we just need to kind of broaden our minds a little bit and think about these definitions a little more carefully yeah that was that was really good I really like that and just to drive that point home the the nuanced one packing here is that there's two maybe more but two main kinds of composability what you're calling Atomic composability which is what you see when you see like a really complicated transaction that calls 13 different D5 apps at once and it executes based off of the inputs and outputs of all of these Z5 apps in the same transaction we lose that ability but I think what you're saying is that the other form of composability where you can like tokenize a vault and you can take that token and put it on a different chain is totally retained and that might actually be the much more significant kind and meaningful kind of composability and also the other Nuance here is that that Atomic composability where we're like integrating many many different D5 apps at once and we're doing an atomic transaction that calls compound end maker and unit Swap all at the same time is also like now that we're losing that that is a lot of Mev that's what Mev is uh is like this Atomic composability uh and so this is how we've like controlled some of the uh Emmy then perhaps the malicious Mev by eliminating some of the the atomic composability uh properties in some ways it might actually be a little bit of a reverse in terms of Mev like we're gonna there's already a lot of cross chain Mev and there's going to be I think more of it so we do need to be careful and in thinking about how we design around this um the but yeah that it doesn't eliminate Mev let's let's be very clear about that the nuances the nuanced Rabbit Hole goes very deep here yes all right so for for people who are with us so far here so I think you've given a articulate economic reason for why the app chain thesis I think um like like your post in previous years right um it's also and you're also saying this a little ahead of its time in that you have to do a little bit of hand waving around look composability will be fixed right like we'll have these Bridges it'll feel very seamless the ux will will flow very nicely and you're starting to see some of that getting built but this is why people even though we can paint the world of a like kind of multi-chain composability we don't really see it right now it's because it hasn't really been built yet so that I feel like is part of the app chain thesis you almost have to take on faith that the builders will build the infrastructure to get us there but let's let's take that on faith I think one of the big questions and maybe a theme recently on banklasses okay what does this mean for our layer ones and I want to talk specifically about ethereum and kind of its role apps ecosystem right kind of you know some the ZK sync folks are calling this like layer three for instance right so you have a application specific roll up on top of a layer two and that's a layer three and then there's the cosmos world uh which we just had a conversation really see with with Zaki uh and sunny about the like the cosmos world of all of these app chains you know they have some some level of mesh security across them so here's what I kind of can't figure out right so I think that um in the short run some of this may be um could be net neutral or net negative even for ethereum if we get get some migration away from kind of uh the main chain and to like layer twos and layer threes But ultimately layer twos in the layer threes they still pay their taxes it's at a much lower tax rate which is kind of nice for them right but they still pay their taxes don't they and all of this settles back down to ethereum so if you're kind of an etholder for example then I you know this is a good thing you you'd rather cannibalize your own mainnet than have another chain cannibalize your main net and so you're still ultimately getting these strands it's a beautiful thing um so I'm very happy as someone who's bullish on eat the asset uh the cosmos world uh of course it's this world of there is no kind of Empire there is no monolith there is no Central uh Government Federal Government that we're all paying taxes to it's all of this world of of kind of city-states my question here is how can the world of city-states compete with the world of like layer threes so if I can get an app chain on ethereum and I get all of the sovereignty benefits that you just outlined including a way to Tinker with all of my business model around kind of like who gets the Mev who you know what my fees are uh you know what the where the the validator revenue is uh you know distributed I get all of that and I also get the security by kind of like the ethereum National Defense Force the ethereum military at the end of the day then I don't have to bootstrap that security fee this has always been you know part of my economic uh argument or like the thought of like why layer threes on ethereum will ultimately out compete uh individual Cosmos app chains is because they don't have to bootstrap and pay for their own defense costs but tell me because I know you're involved in both ecosystems and you have a kind of a neutral you're like your bullish app chains let's say whether that's a an ethereum app chain a roll app or whether that's a Cosmos app chain I think you're bullish on the thesis of app chains what light can you lend on this debate because as a as a lowly L1 holder trying to predict the future of all of these these layer ones and how that turns out I'm trying to figure this out for myself Dan what would you say yeah I mean it's it's really hard for me to play out because I don't think it's inevitable one of the things that I really liked um you guys kind of laying out is that ethereum and Cosmos have very similar visions of what the future looks like the people the developers in the ecosystem especially and they're just approaching it from kind of different angles and it was inevitable that these two models would emerge whether it was ethereum and Cosmos or two different projects these are things that almost must happen the line that I use is that if you re-roll the dice of crypto you will come out with ethereum and Cosmos 100 of the time exactly and I think that when I'm looking at it in terms of which of these when when out and where does where does value capture happen um I I don't know right I agree with you that like these models are inevitable I don't know which is the right way and I'm not sure that it is in some ways like technologically like deterministic there may be a lot of stuff that has to do with kind of like it BD and where do large things get built sooner who creates a better developer experience right we are we are natives we are kind of uh like purists in a lot of ways but I think that there's a lot of people a lot of developers a lot of users coming who maybe don't they're certainly not going to get as deep into the weeds like technically and philosophically they're going to look at the end benefits and the trend has been away from uh I would say pure decentralization and strict ideology and I think that the challenges can be how do we maintain as much of this core ideology and the kind of technical underpinnings of that as possible while still moving quickly and being able to bring more people in and this is one of those ways that I think Cosmos and ethereum as ecosystems are very aligned I see the kind of Technical and philosophical lineage of kind of like pure crypto ecosystems being Bitcoin to ethereum to Cosmos and that doesn't mean that anything that came earlier stops being relevant I just think that that these ecosystems have a lot of beliefs and values that are shared in a way that they may not be as commonly shared with let's say the polka dot ecosystem or the Solana ecosystem or the Aptos ecosystem or anything like that and so I think there's going to be a lot of kind of shared learnings but we I would say who tend to operate within this lineage um need to execute well and quickly because there are some really fast-moving actors in some other ecosystems that may not be as philosophically aligned and if we move too slow and they move fast they're going to bring end user benefits and onboard a billion people uh who don't realize that the the underpinnings there for censorship resistance and for you know self-sovereignty that those those are important to what we're building here and it's kind of why we're building this Dan is calling for a great alliance between the ethereum ecosystem and the cosmos ecosystem uh you know to forge ahead along some of these shared goals there have been bigger asks out of the crypto world than that yeah sure um I remember there was a vision where bitcoiners and ethereans could get along and uh maybe that's coming to fruition we've had increasing amount of uh bitcoiners in the on the podcast lately um Dan I still have that question about kind of the economics of it of kind of a its own uh Sovereign app chain uh in a cosmos versus kind of a a layer three but perhaps we kind of that resolves over time but but I guess maybe the larger Point around this that maybe someone like you would make is if this app chain thesis um like proves out I'm just like I don't know what the Nason portfolio is I don't know what your personal portfolio is but like the play here is not necessarily to bet on the layer ones is it it's your betting on the apps you're betting on the app chains themselves aren't you is that is that the way to interpret kind of the the not Financial advice but like a move for an investor who's thinking critically about this is the new the new meta the new Alpha is actually investing in the apps um yeah I mean very much not giving Financial advice here and and I'll say that you know nascent uh you know for what it's worth we we hold a fair amount of layer one assets like Bitcoin and ethereum especially um but we are also investing in a lot of these applications I think there's a lot of things that we've invested in um you know we these General journalist l1s that are trying to be like bigger faster but better like you know were a relatively small fund and there's a lot of people with a lot more Capital who they can pour into these you know 100 million dollar plus raises we haven't kind of played that game so we've we've almost like just the meta game in our position within it has been such that uh We've we've chosen to focus largely on applications but most of those today have not been looking at like app chains and roll apps um I think over time the successful ones will have a major strategic question to look at doing that but I don't think in any way um the the rise of application specific Roll-Ups and chains is going to wipe out l1s I still think they will be hugely relevant um in as these kind of generalized platforms when people do want Atomic composability and when they do want just that kind of like City Center and access to all the infrastructure that's already been built up for ethereum um you're still gonna go launch there early on or launch one of the l2s or do something so I I don't think that the the app chain thesis is anti-l ones especially ones like ethereum that have like really focused on uh with you guys really leading the charge a lot of ways like have the the monetary uh premium aspect to that so so I still think that is hugely important it's not anti-l1 for sure but it is a different way to kind of think about like your bets in the space right and that's like what's interesting about this app chain world is indeed we're already seeing we might continue to see um app chains kind of switch Allegiant so an app change starts as a Cosmos app chain for example and then some some Roll Up is you know they're looking over their shoulder and looking at that roll up and that's looking pretty nice over there on you know like the ZK evm Roll Up is a layer three and they switch Allegiance or we've seen like recently dydx they were in the starkware ecosystem yeah and they were like uh hmm we don't have we still don't have the sovereignty that we want and now they're going the direction of moving to Cosmos and so what's interesting about the bet that you make on an app chain is well you could just like I'm using DUI DX as an example but you could bat on dydx the app and that is a different sort of bet than betting on a layer one because it might be up on ethereum it might be like in Cosmos it might be in both of these these places uh and so it's a it's a different way to kind of I think look at the uh like the the crypto portfolio as an application kind of specific portfolio it's a different framing of things than we've had in the past yeah and one one thing that I've encouraged people to think about from a strategic standpoint um there was a good post that I think multi-chain put out like the 20 like the 2018 like time frame and they were taking this idea of aggregation Theory and saying how does this apply and I remember one of the examples they were using there is there was they were looking at auger as this kind of prediction Market protocol and there was I can't remember the name of there was something building on top of it and they were making the case for hey if this application built on top of auger this front end um becomes the largest driver of transactions and usage of auger they can actually kind of like backwards like like verticalize their their stack and and they can like Fork out auger and and do their own version of the protocol underneath and the aggregation Theory generally has been written a lot about it I think was formulated by Ben Thompson who writes the strategory newsletter and I think aggregation Theory doesn't cease to apply in a crypto setting and so there's going to be a lot of applications um maybe some of these like you know fintech like neobanks and potentially some web 2 companies that will start to come into the web3 space and they may use existing platforms and protocols and applications like at first but at some point there may also be the incentive for them to fork or build their own thing and redirect some of that and so I I think it's it's really up in the air how a lot of this plays out and who the big winners are I do think that there there's very strong strategic position from some of the OG defy applications and and folks who can grab large market share now but I would definitely have my eyes on and I do have my eyes on some of these I would say more forward-thinking players who may not started out web3 but who can make that transition and look to kind of backwards integrate and potentially Fork some of the protocols because they'll control enough of the users and the flow of assets to be able to do so Dan I think this has been a just an awesome exploration into this app chain roll app thesis there's one last thing I want to unpack before I think we can formally tie a bow on this conversation and that is the topic of censorship uh and I think this is a one of the other big costs of an app chain where governance by the token is a is a thing and this is something that I think will always kind of keep ethereum uh the theorem layer one a very vibrant place to be and that is because the like you said the uniswap contracts on the ethereum layer one will go on in perpetuity as long as ethereum exists that's how they're called coded that's how they're built that's kind of the promise of ethereum is Unstoppable applications if uniswap makes its uni chain and it will start to it will govern over the uni chain in a particular way and one of the benefits of that we talked about is that the uniswap chain will be able to dictate and determine what is good Mev and what is bad Mev and that will improve execution in for his Traders it will also re rode some of the credible neutrality of uniswap as it will make political choices as to what is an allowable transaction on uni chain front running might might be determined to be an unallowable transaction on the uni chain and so front writing might be censored by the uniswap app chain because that produces better execution for its users but it's a little bit like content moderation right like we are now moderating the types of transactions that are allowable on this uni chain and so the trade-off here is that the uniswap app chain allows some censorship it determines what is good and what is bad which ethereum will never do and it will do it will make that trade-off of it will lose some credible neutrality in the name of providing a better service for its customers and I I think that that is a good trade that it will make but of course the world of crypto always is a world of trade-offs and so perhaps some people really value you that censorship resistance and they want to be on the ethereum layer one I think that's the last Nuance to unpack here do you have anything else to add to that yeah I mean I would say it's not that there is no uh attempts at like censorship and control on ethereum L1 or necessarily that there would be on these application specific chains right it it's going to come down to uh how you draw the circle around your community and who's got control and what values they want to build into the protocol that are I would say like enforced via code and then what things are kind of enforced by social consensus and then there there's the holder angle about what's going to happen with kind of governments and Regulators trying to exert their influence in different ways and I would say one of the strongest uh cases for the app chain thesis not taking off would be if we're seeing a lot of the kind of validators that are required for these chains even if you're using shared security models and roles are validator sequencers whatever if some of those are easier to Target from a regulatory perspective as known entities and be shut down for specific activity um whereas I would I would argue that ethereum infrastructure providers they look a lot more like they're helping to run like servers or or like you know developing like web browsers and like their General platform things and so it's not about any particular application and how Regulators May view that they're providing this General platform and I think you you lose some of that argument and it becomes a little bit harder to make I think there are some things that can be done to to soften and to position it but uh yeah that is something that becomes more of a concern as you move at least to certain formulations of roll apps and and app chains Dan my last take that I want you to check uh this one's me shooting from the hip here uh uh the bank list weekly roll-up listeners will be familiar with my uh 0.13 DPI versus eth bottom call which totally broke and failed and now we're at like .06 or something um my take here is that the uh roll app or app chain thesis for D5 tokens D5 tokens that get their own app chains uh they don't lose any of the value that they gain from their applications on ethereum layer one or any uh or ethereum layer twos they also get an additional value capture Source in their own app chain and so an app chain Paradigm for a defy app defy tokens perhaps could could allow D5 tokens to reclaim some lost territory in their ether defy token ratio as in they might actually be able to gain some ground that they've lost because defy tokens tend to be down only versus ether over like the last two years now uh so maybe the off chain app chain world for D5 tokens is a way for these D5 tokens to regain some lost value in in the East terms that's my last take of the show I mean it's it's certainly possible and I I think uh we shouldn't look at it as going and trying to capture an L1 premium or something for these tokens by moving to throw an app chain I think it's more about they're able to do their core function more efficiently if they do this um and I'll I'll thread it a a teaser here is you know we've talked about some of this Mev and internalization and that being something that can be really great for a lot of these things um I'm becoming increasingly convinced that there are ways to design protocols today on ethereum that internalize more of this Mev and can get some of these benefits and I think it opens up a whole new design space for these protocols and for ways that they can actually capture value um while creating a more efficient protocol for their their users and so I'm I'm very excited to to explore that more and and hopefully we can talk about that in the not too distant future amazing not Dan's take necessarily but but maybe a take to come from this is um the the next D5 Renaissance the bull market shall resume once we figure out defy governance and once we figure out app chains maybe we'll start to see a uh you know an uptrend start David to help you out on your on your ratio bet uh Dan it's been so much fun having you on thank you so much for joining us and exploring the app chain thesis today always a
