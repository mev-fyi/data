[Music] hey bankless nation welcome to the most recent issue of meet the nation today we're talking to joe and zach of aztec protocol assec is a privacy software solution working with zk proofs zero knowledge proofs on ethereum to make private transactions a thing uh and not only private transactions but also private scalable transactions so asic has been a team working in this space for a while long anticipated uh and they are just rolling out their uh zk payments uh infrastructure which is kind of like venmo uh on ethereum native native payments on ethereum and so just you know simple sends of ethic uscc but when you send it to someone it sends it privately and so this is in a roll-up and so you deposit your assets into the roll-up and then you once they're in that roll-up in your specific address on that roll-up you can shield those funds and then send them to someone in a private manner using cryptographic magic it's a really really important conversation really important piece of technology for ethereum because as we know ethereum and blockchains open permissionless systems are completely transparent at all times and so if we ever want to use this futuristic financial system for the future of finance it would be really nice if like we could pay people without like doxing our own accounts or just generally have privacy we go into these conversations and why privacy is important in this show so without further ado let's go ahead and get right into this meet the nation with the guys from aztec protocol but first we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with d5 tokens and products you need to download the dharma mobile app dharma is a non-custodial smart contract wallet and comes with a bridge that connects you right into your bank account dharma is the fastest and most efficient wallet between your fiat in your bank account and any token on unit swap or even any vault in urine with dharma you can get over 25 000 per week into the dfi universe and you can do it non-custodially if you or anyone you know is hot on defy and you're trying to get your money into a defy investment dharma is the place to go signing up and going through kyc is an absolute breeze it took me just under three minutes and after signing into my bank account via plaid i am now just one transaction away from any token that uniswap has to offer go to www.dharma.io that's d h a r m a dot io download the darba app and get yourself unbanked today all right bankless nation i am here with zach williamson and joe andrews zack is the cto at aztec and joe is the chief of product asic guys uh welcome to the nation thanks happy to be here hi yeah thanks for having us on so aztec pro you guys have been working for a decent while now working to introduce privacy to ethereum so where does this conversation start why does aztec need to exist and how does aztec bring privacy to ethereum maybe we could start at the high level the the bird's eye view yeah sure thing yeah um so why do we exist good question uh uh yeah um justify one's existence um so what uh we think that um uh as a privacy company obviously we think that privacy is essential to um the kind of the long-term success and feature of blockchain technology um so our thesis is effectively that um as um blockchain technology reaches more into people's everyday lives and it starts to intersect with the real world um people's demands for privacy are going to um very much mirror what they expect from their from their traditional web 2 counterparts so when you're for example uh you know if you're getting your salary paid through a blockchain uh or your or a large of amounts of your a large volume of your payments is going through a blockchain and you're um you don't want people to be able to speak on what what's going on there um in the much more short term um there's obviously d5 has been an absolutely huge um kind of industry over the last few years and if you are trading large nationals then that's a big problem because that will move markets and people can see what you're doing and then confront running your trades and you have all these associated issues that privacy can very efficiently resolve so that's what that's why we're here while we're doing what we're doing because we think that it's it's kind of critical for for um for the user to be able to have strong privacy guarantees if they want to be able if they want to use a blockchain um for if they want to move a lot of their kind of their their online life into into into the web free world joe you want to add anything to that yeah i mean i think i just echo most of those sentiments but uh i think it's a prerequisite for that as well so if you want to have like uh kind of uh self-custody of your assets i don't think that should come at the cost of um everyone being able to see which those assets are which is the current uh d5 status quo um so we're we're setting out to change that and uh it's going to be an exciting year um with the launch of zika money um as the first step yeah totally my my personal experience with uh privacy on chain is like i have two main wallets i have like my my cash wallet which has one to three percent of my my net worth and because i'm bankless all of my net worth is in ethereum and then i have my my cold storage wallet which is where like all the rest of my money is and so when i'm trying to make payments when i'm telling like friends to to pay me back for something or whatever and i'm trying to get them to use crypto i tell them to pay my payment wallet but then if i ever want to get my payment wallet money down to my cold storage wallet then i link those two things and so they can kind of see where my where literally all of my net worth is and that's a terrible user experience because when i ask them to to venmo me that doesn't mean that they automatically get to like you know look under the hood and see where all of my money is and so that that's bad ux and uh joe you said something just now like where if we all want people to use their be like self-custody uh do self-custody for their own funds that implies that like well that's going to be transparent on the blockchain somewhere where like you know if i store my money on like coinbase i can kind of use coinbase to kind of obscure things but then i'm not self-cussing anymore and that's kind of the kind of the whole point of this revolution um and i think there's maybe before we get into how aztec works maybe talk about how transparent blockchains are because like people think that you know bitcoin like naive people will say like bitcoin is only good for money laundering or like you know crypto is just good for just like doing a legal illicit activity maybe talk about how perhaps why that's not true and and how incredibly transparent these systems actually are yeah oh so do you want to well i just want to give an anecdote one of our early employees actually felt they'll fry of that same kind of uh pay pay me with crypto and and like uh we could kind of uh see what else was happening and which kind of uh d5 protocols they've been investing in and um i think for even even people in like uh the industry like it's a it's kind of one slip up and you're you're kind of branding uh your entire publishing everything on chain and and we've we've actually run a piece recently on on mark cuban who had the same uh slip up recently when he tried to buy an nft so yeah i think there is a lot of misconceptions around how how public a blockchain is um maybe zach can explain a little bit more about that case well right now in order for a blockchain to kind of to function in order for everybody to validate the correctness of everyone's transactions um you need the entire transaction from graphing public so basically the whole the web of who's paying who and how much they're paying is completely visible to anybody and so people think it's it's um anonymous um or isn't transparent because um people's identities are kind of masked by addresses so you know you you have you know you have an ethereum address that might not be linked to your real world identity but um uh the more the moral kind of financial activity you actually perform with that ethereum address um the less relevant your real world is it becomes more relevant your own chain and identity becomes um and particularly if you can link that that information with who you are in the real world which can be quite quite easy you know if you just you know you tr you if uh you know you if you pay a friend for example and they they they see what your address is you know and then then that information gets can get because book asks to who knows who knows who um and so because you can build up that that entire transition graph you can perform quite sophisticated statistical analysis to see um who's spending what how they're spending it and where they're spending it um so yes it's it's it's actually incredibly incredibly transparent technology it needs to be right now multi function and and there are entire companies like chain analysis that are built on uh on taking away the fog away from away from public blockchains right where they are they are intentionally doing all of the data aggregation and analytics that they possibly can can to help mainly things like governments uh do do very noble things which is you know track down actual real crimes uh and i remember chain analysis uh was part of uh this uh child pornography bus that they were using uh bitcoin to uh to to pay for for trial point and that i'm super happy to find out that that was something that was able to be traced however we can you know extrapolate that into perhaps more dystopian versions of the future where if if every single financial action every sort of political donation every sort of like where you shopped and where you sent your money is completely public um it's it throws into question like are we really a free society if everything if all of our money is completely public and all the consequences uh are public of our money and this is something that david chum i think even uh predicted back in in the 80s where like if every single internet action that all humans ever do ever are public that can be used to that can be used to control society and so the the importance of personal privacy over your your your funds couldn't be any more important um so with that background let's go into a little bit of the details as to how uh how how you guys actually add privacy to ethereum let's start with the underlying uh technology there um and so uh uh zach since you are the cto let's start with you how does how does how do you guys actually add privacy to ethereum so yeah well through through zero launch cryptography um so it's it seems like uh on the server seems like an almost impossible um problem uh because in order to validate the correctness of every ethereum transaction you need to you need to see it so how do you how do you achieve privacy how do you how do you how do you ensure that the blockchain is correct no one starts spending on cheating when you can't actually see people's transactions and so this is where zero crews come in it's it's it's a it's a technology which allows you to basically um to prove the correctness of some piece of logic um uh whilst keeping the the actual um what's it um allow you to hold back secret information so one example would be uh when you're logging on to website you could say you could prove that you know your password without so right now if you look onto upside down what happens is you send your plaintext um password to the to the website they then will hash it and check it against their records and see see if you you know you know your the password your username but instead you could service your knowledge proof proving to the website uh say to amazon saying like i know what the password is for my username but i'm not going to share it with you but here's a mathematical proof that i know it um and that's kind of effectively a similar similar thing to what we're doing here where we're encoding um a um encrypted transaction um in one of these in one of these um zero knowledge proofs so that you can uh you know you have some you have some inputs and some outputs and you prove that the you know the sum of the inputs equals this on the output so that there's no level spending but it allows you to encrypt the values that you'll be never being transferred and allows you to encrypt the identities of the senders and the recipients um so at a high level that's how it works however it's uh get getting it working on on ethereum it's uh is set with a lot of a lot of technical challenges um just because this technology is quite um difficult to use at scale uh because it's very very um computationally intensive to construct these mathematical proofs right and so ethereum doesn't actually care about its own transparent nature it doesn't care to publish everything to the world it only cares that a transaction is legitimate or not and so the problem being um the problem being tackled here is like can we verify can we tell ethereum that we are making a legitimate transaction without also doing all the transparency stuff like if we if we make everything public that's a very easy way to uh indicate to ethereum that this is a legitimate transaction but there are other ways that we can communicate to ethereum that this transaction is legitimate that we can obfuscate all of the uh identity features behind that transaction uh and so again like like you said that's with zero knowledge proofs which is a cryptographic tool how computationally intensive is this cryptographic tool and is that is that a variable that can be adjusted via innovation oh yeah absolutely yeah um it is variable that has been adjusted quite heavily already um we had to invent a lot of the technology ourselves um to get this working on ethereum uh so this this i guess the first the first case of this being used this technology being used in in in in production was with the the pioneering zika in 2015. um give some numbers like it would take a zcash node about 30 seconds to grind through um the computations you did to make a zoological um and that's running running like um software directly on your on your laptop or your computer um generally when people are talking uh well using ethereum there which means that your typical motor interaction is going to be your website um and the software you can run and web setting um it's going to be much slower than you can then you can run into a natively installing code on a machine like like like a zcash node so um basically the z z originally took 30 seconds to make the proof our zero circuits are uh more complicated than the z cache ones because we have um we wanted to build a social account recovery functionality um and we're working in um we're building the web where things are approximately where cryptography is roughly eight times slower so you know you run those numbers and you you can easily get to transactions like proof construction times uh that that run into several minutes um if not longer um does that run up against ethereum's block time so if that proof construction time takes over a minute yeah ethereum block times or 12 seconds do those things collide or are those different are those different they're a bit different because with because this is this is a user constructing a private transaction proof on the in that browser so if they they can se they can in theory they can send it in any block so um they don't have to construct it within within a block time um but uh for the sake of the user experience you don't want them waiting like a minute or ten minutes uh for to make it to grind through the zero knowledge brief um their computer cpu is just like going and their fan is heating up and all that stuff right exactly yeah um so so we we did a lot of um original research into into this problem ourselves so um uh me and my uh and our chief scientist ariel gabazon um published a um a new kind of what's called the universal zika stock um so uh which basically it's um one of these zika snack is a fancy kind of zealand proof where you can take any program uh and turn it into a mathematical proof um and uh traditionally these these zika snacks come with a lot of drawbacks like you need to do these very elaborate um kind of trusted setups um uh when you build these uh when you when you kind of encode your programmers as you know those proofs as you know circuits um uh which is a big security risk and a big and it's a big coordination problem um uh universal snarks uh basically get around the problem by requiring one of like basically you need to do one trusted setup to generate some cryptographic secrets uh that nobody knows the the um the the keys to um but once you've done that step which we did last year with our auditions ignition ceremony um then you can build any any kind of you can build any you can occur any kind of programmers as you get snuck second without running additional trusted setups um so that was one of the innovations that this that this new premium system we learned about um water table which we call planck um we thought it was a funny name at the time and um yeah and it's also one of the uh it's it's the fastest universal snuck um uh available at the moment um and so yeah we've had to basically improve um the the speed of these these premium systems by at least an order of magnitude to make it practical um for ethereum would this be would you describe this as perhaps your guys's main like obstacle or your main goal is or the main purpose of aztec is trying and compressing zk uh zk proofs into as small as a a um byte size is that even the right and right terminology or just the compressing the efficiency of these proofs down to as small as possible because like is that the thing that you guys have really unlocked well more or less we didn't um it's not really the precise which is the problem because the the existing grouping system existing sniper tech's already already crashed down the precises to vary to very small small values it's more the time it takes to construct these mathematical proofs on a computer that was that was the massive bottom line that we had to we had to make um perform a lot of original research to uh we still have some way to go as well i mean if you kind of look at like um this this coming on par with a card transaction um a card transaction or a venmo transaction end to end is kind of a second um maybe a couple of seconds if you have a network hiccup um ck money on on a good device is about eight seconds right now um but the next version uh coming out in the summer um will make us on par with that especially on native proverbs in apps so um i'd say we're mostly kind of mostly there for payments um the next challenge is then what other things can you do with these kind of transactions because we're not kind of in a fixed world of um hey i can just pay you um we're running on ethereum so we can we can do anything and so you can do much more exciting things and and those proofs are still a little bit too slow to run on the browser um but by the end of the year we should be in a position where um you can do very complicated kind of uh proofs maybe taking out a personal loan um proving your salaries above a certain uh threshold for a credit score um those sorts of things uh become a possibility and we're really excited for that to kind of uh become unlocked um and have people move their identities into this network right that's definitely the some of the more uh sci-fi applications of zero knowledge stuff and i definitely want to get into get in there but i think i've gone a little bit too far into the weeds for the listeners so i want to back up and ask what is aztek and what is the product that is available that you guys just released a couple days ago um maybe maybe let's start there sure um so we uh launched a kind of uh demo of our protocol as it stands currently uh it's at zk.money so you can go to it now it's live um you can think of it as a private memo so you can register a username shield some funds at the moment we just support eth but we'll have a die btc and a few other assets coming shortly uh once you've shielded the funds they're private they're kind of cloaked under the aztec veil and you can send them to any other um username in the network uh for a reduction in fees compared to sending it on standard ethereum or you could send it back to a different ethereum address so back to your earlier example of kind of your cash wallet and your hardware wallet um you could move funds between those wallets using aztec if you wanted to or you could have your friends pay you at your zk money username instead of your hot wallet so short term where we're going after kind of the the private memory for the crypto community right and so and so when i i've made my aztec account it's david hoffman um at david hoffman just like just like my venmo uh and then and then what i did is i submitted one ether deposited one each and that's into a roll-up right you guys are on a roll-up yep um so yeah one of the things you zika starts can also be used for scaling as well as privacy so we do both um yeah so um you know we're operating a basically a layer two section using our zika snap tech to enable more efficient private transactions okay and then what kind of roll-up construction is that so it's it's not um it's it's one that use it's it's i guess it's called the statically it's called the zk roll up the zkz roll basically we we users send um constructs um private transactions locally on their device and they send them to a roller provider um and at that point the role provider has no discerning and sustainable information you've already encrypted and analyzed your identity and the rollout provider's job is to basically um aggregate a lot of transactions to go so they take 128 of these private transactions and they construct zero knowledge proof which kind of validates the correctness of these transactions so that the only thing that goes to the ethereum is one zero knowledge proof that proves 128 private transactions instead of just one um which massively reduces the cost of what we're what we're doing um i remember vitalik having a talk about this where he was talking about the power of roll-ups and then he and just went one layer deeper it's like well we have roll-ups but what if we rolled it up again and i think that's maybe that's what you guys are talking about where you're adding in zero knowledge proofs which um which do compress data right and then inject it into a roll-up which compresses that data again and then that is what is submitted to ethereum so not only do we have efficiency in transactions but we also have privacy at the same time that's pretty cool thanks yeah that's exactly what we do um and it yeah one of the main innovations we had uh we developed was we were the first team that created a um the the kind of technology that that's that was capable of um creating basically a zero knowledge proof that they are the zero element proofs um in a manner that's compatible with ethereum very cool and so okay so back to back to my user experience flow so i set up david hoffman on your guys's uh on you guys roll up and then i submitted one ether and so i have one ether in that roll up and then i was able to shield that transaction but i've got a question for you guys why was i only able to shield point three nine of my one ether that i deposited yeah now you should have been out to shield the the the full amount um unless you paid a very high fee um so we we enable users to kind of uh configure the fee uh to make the roll up settle faster um if you if you shielded um 1 8 and that was kind of settled and all your transactions were stable you should have that as your spendable balance if you were trying to send that to another user um yeah maybe that's where that's where i got caught up because because i think i was only able to send um a fraction of the ether that i deposited yeah so this is um you can think of this a bit like a bitcoin utxo so um when you have a shielded balance you it's not actually stored as as one number you they're encrypted notes that have different uh values so you'll start with kind of a note worth one zero key and then as you send it if you send me point one you end up with kind of a change note that's worth 0.9 and you have to in the current system um you have to wait for that transaction to be processed before you get your change back before you can then process the next transaction you can solve this um with kind of a bit more cryptography um but in the current system yeah uh you have to wait a little bit and so if you're if you're planning on doing lots of kind of individual transactions it's best to kind of shield smaller amounts uh so you have lots of notes um or if you want to do a larger transaction shield it all in one go and yeah so you're we're working on resolving that user experience it's uh yeah um uh yes it's because it's that our first uh our first deployment of this tech um there are a few a few yeah things like this that we need to work out to make it a yeah a truly seamless experience so when you guys said that um i could ask people to send me uh money on my uh on my zk account can i get them to do that from the main ethereum l1 can they can that be one seamless uh one seamless transaction and do they need to be aware of the fact that i'm sending them to a zk wallet or do they need to also have their ether or usdc or die or whatever in the zk roll up long term we we can get there um at the moment they would have to kind of shield via um kind of zk money but they can shield directly to you so instead of shielding to themselves and then sending it they can do one transaction um i think it's quite an exciting place to like maybe take the conversation for a little bit because um if a wallet decides to integrate that uh and the native kind of like flow inside a wallet is kind of hey send uh the wallet could look up uh at david hoffman or your ethereum address and it could decide how you want to receive things and there's quite a lot of work being done by ens to actually resolve um ens domains to and now too um so we're kind of we're part of a like a a research discussion group to try and uh get that working um over the next year or two so i think long term it shouldn't matter kind of where you want to receive your funds in the short term because this is kind of leading edge tech there's a little bit of friction there yeah yeah let's go into that a little bit more so um you know people often talk about with rollups and l2s there's fragmented liquidity there's onboarding and off-boarding onto these onto these roll-ups and people are worried about that ux and then we have the conversations around like connext when connects is trying to build payment channels between various l2s um just go into more detail about how you guys are or the available uh options or paths forward that you guys have to to help that that uh the flow of funds going in and out of the the roll-up sure so so i think for we definitely see the fragmentation issues of of people trying to move d5 protocols to other layer twos um for us we're kind of focused on privacy so um our l2 is going to be a home for people's funds um where they can go out and do safe private transactions so we're actually in the next release we're building a bridge we call it the d5 bridge um and and that bridge enables you to kind of i think if it like a bus leaving the roll up and it's a bus going to a certain destination it could be uni-swap it could be another l2 um it could be anywhere basically on ethereum and we're using kind of tools like that to help us aggregate the cost of moving funds from aztec to another system um i do think that there is risk though with kind of other projects kind of trying to split the liquidity pools and uh our short-term kind of goal is just to whenever we talk about defy we're going to point our roll up to the main net liquidity pool so we'll have like an eath die swap in a liquid pair um and we'll kind of make that available through the roll-up and it will call out to your new swap l1 directly and make the swap and bring the funds back we just think it's a kind of a simpler way of getting the same effect without having to bake in all these new trust assumptions of fraud proofs or or complex l2 code sure so if i have a bunch of zke that i've deposited and i don't want to turn that into zk die maybe i i send you i sign a message and you guys receive it on the on the roll up and then whenever the bus leaves i don't know maybe once every hour or so whenever the bus leaves then my all my zk east will be swapped for zk die and that will and none of my privacy features will or characteristics have will have been leaked to the main chain yeah precisely yeah and uh you know and if if that process had like a 99 other other users on it then you're only paying what like one percent of the cost of the of a layer one um unisoft transaction ah and so that one uniswap trade is actually shared between everyone else on the bus as well probably plus a little bit more of uh a little bit extra computation as well but again yeah between every single rider on the bus yeah yeah exactly and then could could the rate of buses leave faster and faster and faster yeah as long as there's demand for it um yeah that's very cool that's very cool uh and where else can these buses go like where instead of just uh with uh you know amms is there other options as well yeah well we're working on creating a kind of an interface um well what we're calling this bridge contract where basically the way we're modeling it is is as a as a um if you if you if your interaction if your interaction with like layer 2 or d4 protocol can be modeled as um a token swap or two token swaps then um you should be able to integrate with our with our with this with this portal to our layer two that we're building um so that you can then yeah get get the benefit of kind of having uh aggregate like uh yeah these these kind of buses of users come leaving us taking transaction with your with your protocol hey guys i hope you're enjoying the interview so far quick break in the action because we got to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave.com gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemini since i first got back into crypto back in 2017 and it has been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens like wi-fi ave uni and also they are one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets having both the option of logging into the gemini.com website or instead opening the gemini mobile app has allowed me to be able to access any and all exchange and on or off ramp services that i've needed to on a moment's notice with instant

aztec um was for first getting these uh private payments and privacy uh the zk roll up out the door but then i think i remember something about um just uh uh private smart contracts like generalized private smart contracts is that what is that what's next on the road map is that is that the next logical spot in the conversation or is there something first that we should talk about well that's that's that's the next uh it's the end game um uh i don't want to make any kind of um uh over i don't want to make any unrealistic claims when we'll get that because there are a ton of technical hurdles that we need to overcome but we've already like we've done the uh we've done all the heavy r d lifting um so it's it's it's um yeah it's it's just about developing building the tech now um yeah so right now lance you can just do basic private transactions but the goal the end state is that um you can um uh yeah create completely private smart contracts directly within our layout too kind of instead of your smart controller being encoded as an evm evm code your smart contracts encoded as a snark circuit um and that will enable users to build fully private assets where they can define their own transaction types um and like how like you know their own um their logic for how these transactions can occur as well as um building quite like feature-rich e5 criticals that can talk to these private cryptocurrencies and um the end goal is to have that all happening directly on our layer two um so to keep to minimize the cost the transaction costs um of these kind of inter-private contract transactions so what does that mean does that mean that oh go ahead joe i'm just going to say yeah that the path to getting there is i think quite interesting as well um because there's a number of kind of stepping stones i think that that make that truly useful um and right now you may have noticed there's a limit on uh zk money and partly that's because of kind of the custody around keys and zk money um we've solved that in in the current version uh that we're testing on on kind of internally and where we can kind of actually use standard ethereum keys so um not only now kind of the cost of a private transaction would be cheaper than um like a normal ethereum transaction but you can enjoy the same kind of custody benefits that you that you choose to use for your kind of uh layer one assets so i think that's a prerequisite and then a second so what does that mean does that mean that the same private keys that i have on my normal metamask or ledger wallet does the same thing on the zk wallet so like perhaps perhaps i just use that metamask drop down from going from the ethereum l1 to going to the to the zk roll up is that what that implies precisely so yeah right right now with the tech we've released which um you you need your you need to generate um an aztec account which has its own aztec private keys um which is quite like the this is the the generally the way that private um transaction systems have to operate because um the kind of cryptography that ethereum does um uh to validate ethereum transactions typically has been a little bit too expensive to perform inside the snark circuit um but our latest research has solved that problem so that in our next version the roll-up yeah you're going to be able to directly authorize and validate private transactions in our related roll-up directly with um signatures signed through metamosque with your ethereum keys very cool very cool sorry joe to cut you off you were taking us through the past to get the private uh applications yeah so then the second step is um we kind of have basic kind of contracts working uh internally for this this d5 bridge we're building um but it's not developer friendly um and it's kind of i guess like uh point three on on on the journey is is is us rolling that out uh to mainstream users and kind of uh battle testing the system uh and and once that's done we can kind of take all those learnings and roll it up in a very nice kind of developer friendly uh sdk and with our programming language we've been building called noir um which will kind of realize the full end state of the vision i think it's worth going into the details of noir because it's out in alpha but it's not obviously not usable in the roll-up yet we're just getting feedback on on the language um yeah it's it's a it's an ambitious roadmap but i think that the next kind of through six months there'll be a lot of a lot of updates and um i think people will start to see that this is kind of no longer kind of sci-fi tech and it's it's running live on on mainnet um so we're super excited yeah joe paint us that picture what what is the world of ethereum like when aztec is towards the end of its roadmap and everything that you guys want to achieve has been achieved uh what can we do with ethereum now that this new technology has been unlocked that's a good question i think we can um i like to think of like the the kind of software developer who's probably working at a crypto startup um he's now getting his salary paid through um die um he's gone completely bankless um and now he's going for a loan um he can prove just from his phone like that he's got enough kind of like uh headroom in his like disposable income to get get the loan for his mortgage um maybe he can even buy the house on chain uh as some sort of nft uh for a noir contract but uh that's maybe a few years away there's some property law you'd have to solve first but um yeah i think i think those sorts of things um are gonna start to be kind of the topic of the conversation over the next kind of uh maybe 12 to 18 months um it's kind of no longer d5 but like user finance that i think is what where we're really excited it's it's the sort of finance that um you want in your everyday life and and those are the things that aztecs focused on um so lately especially with all of this defy speculation going on we've been uh every time that like sbf or alameda research every time that they move their funds on chain people people say like they start to speculate like where those funds are going to go like theory arrows capital their address is um defy maximalist dot eth and so people watch that address and then all of a sudden they'll you will see like some token random token pumping or some massive like massively valued nft be purchased from an exchange with a with a maximally successful version of aztec is all of these all of the the movements of these funds or like somebody buys like the 60 million dollar like people nft and like people are all trying to speculate who it is with aztec this can all be done with and no and in theory no one would ever be able to know who is doing any sort of activity at all unless they chose to actually publish that is that correct definitely yeah that's the problem that's what we want to get to um so i i don't think we're gonna so then we're not gonna the plan isn't to completely like um like put a cloak around d5 um because uh it's it's very dif to be completely financed about this it's quite difficult to do a few things in with privacy like for example uh decentralized trade matching if you don't know what the trades are how do you match them but what you can do is you can analyze the identities of the traders and you can also um you can also obfuscate the values by effectively um making every transaction type uniform so like if you have a if you have a an exchange trading like eat and die uh if you make every uh if every if you want to do a large trade of say like a thousand eight if you split that up into a thousand one transactions using a roll-up so it's cheap then um uh then you you you can um you can maintain the uh the anonymity of identity and so yeah people will know the trade is happening so um and that could still move markets but they won't know huber's actually the the beneficiary or the instigator very cool very cool and so that that's hopefully like the where we end up but what about for the end of 2021 like how how will your guys how well as technology technology impacts people's lives this year yeah so i think um zk money we're going to try and grow at another 10x at least in terms of users and really increase the the functionality there so we want private swaps from inside the interface um and starting to also think about kind of other areas you can spend your capital so if you've got some funds in ck money maybe you can use it to buy some things um kind of privacy products like password managers or vpns so start to think of it a bit more like a kind of um kind of more like a just a private home for your funds on ethereum so when you want to go and do something you first go to zq money then you can uh dispatch those funds to a friend or or to purchase something um by the end of the year yeah we'll have uh these l1 integrations for for swapping out as popular d5 assets um and we'll have uh fingers crossed uh test net versions of uh noir um in programmable privacy um kind of in alpha people playing playing around with it on the test nets but it'll be a few more months into kind of 2022 before we're ready to let uh let the training wheels come off uh noir itself uh because it's extremely complicated well i'm very very optimistic about about the future of aztec and guys i i have to ask the question since we're in a bull market is there a a part of aztec that where a token makes sense is there a room for a token in the future of aztec do you want to feel this one jay sure um definitely there is i mean tokens are have huge kind of benefits um especially in in networks and um they can incentivize community and uh more specifically on on a kind of layer two network where you need to kind of decentralize the actual network itself and have these kind of uh block producers or rollout providers as we call them um incentivizing those to perform correctly um is a perfect use for a token um we're doing a lot of analysis on on how to do that and and whether it fits our kind of model um but yeah i definitely think um if we achieve that vision a token will have some some big part of it wow very cool awesome is there anything else that that people should know about the future of aztec and your guys's technology anything we haven't covered yet i mean i think i think i think i think all the points have pretty much been hit um yeah i mean if you want to if you want to play around with that you know rely as just so we're live at zkd money um if you want to experience um yeah uh um affordable privacy on ethereum uh it's here today and yeah we're really excited to be able to um kind of like turbocharge our technology and bring bring a lot of innovation into the coming years right so now that that uh zk money and as technology technology has been deployed to ethereum i would imagine that you guys are looking looking for users but i would also imagine you guys are looking for specific kinds of users or specific types of developers um so for people that are watching this who what kind of of defy users or or developers are you guys really looking for to help stress test your technology yeah so on the user front i think it's just it's anyone who's kind of um had the the same problem we we went through earlier they have kind of they've moved some of their funds into ethereum and then and they have two pools of capital and they don't want to link them and i think that's a great a great early user um to test the current version um and in terms of developers we have all of the functionality available uh that we built zokay money with through our sdk um so if you're a developer at a wallet or um kind of uh any sort of um crypto custody solution um i think having a play with our docs which are live at uh developers.aztec.network would be a good place to start and we can't wait to see people start to build their own interfaces uh that integrate with the system um because this is a permissionless network after all so um yeah it's not up to us what you build um we've just given you an example of what you can build so yeah we're very excited to see uh how how the community takes that and moves it forward fantastic and if people listening want to join the community or just learn more where is where does the community live do you guys have a discord a telegram yeah we've got a discord um we can add that to the um comments or something yep yeah i'll add that into the show notes for sure awesome well guys this has been a fantastic exploration into aztec so uh zach and joe thank you for joining me on uh bankless meet the nation thanks for having us
