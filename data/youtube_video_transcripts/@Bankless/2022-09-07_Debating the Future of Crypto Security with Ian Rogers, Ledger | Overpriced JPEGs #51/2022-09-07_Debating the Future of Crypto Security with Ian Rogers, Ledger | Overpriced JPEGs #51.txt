heard like you're like this skater boy from indiana you end up at lvmh and now you're in like crypto security hardware tie it together for us what are like the themes that have driven your professional decision making in your career thus far yeah you know it's interesting because they they do hang together and nfts is actually the like what comes after the equal sign oddly you know i feel like you know by most importantly i i just i'm curious person i love music um and i think because it's like i always thought i was like a music guy and then i realized i was kind of like a culture person whatever that means um but what i what i mean by that is i think somehow i've become a student of the way the internet has changed culture or the way technology has changed culture and for me that came because i i grew up in a small town in indiana and i and i just liked stuff that wasn't available to me in this small town you know i mean the music i liked wasn't on the radio it wasn't at the local record store i was a skateboarder and i i remember you know i remember these times when you know i'd watch a skate video and i'd see steve caballero wearing a misfits t-shirt and then i'd spend two years trying to find a misfits album right you know that that was my experience in the 80s growing up you know in a world before the internet you know i remember when my stepdad brought home thrasher magazine i think it was actually transworld skateboarding that he brought home for the first time and i just felt like it was like a portal into another world that i had never that i didn't know existed but gave me hope i was like holy [ __ ] maybe one day i can get out of this [ __ ] and you know and and and like be around people that are like me and it wasn't until i went to indiana university until i was on the internet properly at university in 1990 um that i met people who like the same music as me really and so that's what the internet has always meant for me it's meant this this sort of like escape from mainstream culture and put me into these like niche worlds um that meant something to me and and so i've been a record collector since i was five years old and i there's got to be the venn diagram you know if you are you know into computers collect records um you know you put you pop out as an nft collector i think yeah it's like you know it's an easy bake oven it's like the same thing like the people that collect vinyl you know they're you know again literally my whole life you know it only makes sense it's the same it's the same kind of um urge that drives you but it's it's not just an urge to collect it's actually an urge to be a part of these cultures and and to know that like something uh you know this record that i'm buying today that nobody gives a [ __ ] about is gonna be something they care about tomorrow in a way right you know and and so that to me there's there's this through line but that's what got me into digital music i started you know making music on computers in the early 90s i was really lucky and um got a job at the indiana university music library where the guy that ran the music library had this vision that music was going to stream to computers and he asked me if i would build a system where you could search the card catalog and then stream what you find to a workstation in the library and i was like well you're paying me six dollars and fifty cents an hour i'm going to build whatever you asked me to build but as a result i built the you know the first search and stream system that i'm aware of um in the early 90s and then it was kind of groundhog day for me i i actually i i started building there was this new thing called the web i was the maintainer of the beastie boys frequently asked questions list on usenet which will mean a lot to some people and absolutely nothing to other people um and i'd moved that into a website i ended up dropping out of grad school in 1995 to go on tour with the beastie boys and moved to california um i there were very few of us you know the this is why i love the world of nfts too you know i can collect on tezos and be talking to the artist on twitter an hour later you know but that's what it was like in those days too there were like five of us doing music on the internet and a couple of us got together and my friend rob lord who used to run this thing called the internet underground music archive and moved on to a little mp3 player called winamp and i joined as the first employee at the company that made winamp um and that was a great you know cinderella story in 1999 we sold that company to aol there were only four of us the company had no debt no equity it was like really and when you say went up to people today like when you say usenet there's only two responses either like what are you talking about or dude [ __ ] win it oh [ __ ] you know um that's you know so i'm really proud to have been a part of part of these things then like through the 2000s you know long story short and like you know bankruptcies and failures aside we you know did groundworld records the bc boys did yahoo music because rob and i started another little company called media code that we sold to dave goldberg was an amazing human being at yahoo and then um topspin which was direct to consumer marketing and commerce ultimately a commercial failure but very kind of relevant when i went to lvmh and even now in in the world of nfts and then with jimmy iveen lukewood trent resner dr dre built beats music sold that to apple built apple music and then i felt like oh my god i've done digital music for 20 years and and it's here you know when i started i can imagine i was building a streaming music product in 1991 and 92 like nobody cared no like if i tried to exp if i were to party in college and i was like yeah like check out my research project you would go talk to someone else right i mean like this dude is a nerd um you know but by the time you know tim cook walks out on stage and it says we love music behind him like wow i'm super proud like 20 years of my life maybe this is the last thing i'll ever do i don't i don't know but like it feels important to me at least as a music fan it felt important but it also felt like the finish line not the starting line you know i felt like okay now what like am i a music executive oh [ __ ] like that's a bummer i didn't ever wanted to be that um but it's okay i'm not saying i'm not complaining i had a good good life and selling your company to apple is a great thing to to do and and but i was you know there is i guess to answer your question something in me that that wants to be on the frontier a consumer internet with 6.5 billion smartphones is really boring to me it's as boring as a shopping mall with a jc penny at one end and a montgomery ward at the other you know where's the action where's the you know where's the new stuff where the where are the pioneers you know all of us in america and i realize this more clearly now that i live in europe you know my my my ancestors like came to america in the 1600s like we like frontiers yeah where's the frontier i want to be i liked i liked using it a lot more than i like facebook right so you know where is that where do i get that feeling and um so i think you find your way in crypto like pretty naturally and then as somebody who you know has been you know a holder of bitcoin and ethereum since sort of circa 2015 you know when you when you start to like not just see nfts but feel the world of nfts you know you're you're collecting you're you're a patron of the arts you know what i mean like um i don't mean to overstate it but that's it's a it's a feeling as a person right you're like oh i'm doing a value exchange with an artist you know that that i care about that's that feels great it's like buying vinyl on bandcamp you know it feels good um and so anyway that's to me it does hang together to be that kind of like record collector technologist frontier person um you know and i skipped over lvmh which i think is actually a really important part of the story you know i kind of went to lvmh on a flyer i wanted to get out i was happy to get out of apple um happy to get out of the music business partly because i just wasn't sure anybody would ever hire me to do anything but digital music i was like oh i'm digital music guy i'm not maybe i can't maybe i'm not capable of caring about anything else i don't know and so i get a call from i never heard of lvmh when they called me i'd never heard of the arno family when they called me but you know i went to wikipedia and i figured it out but you know how to use the internet so you know how to use the internet i could get i'm a quick study um and and i thought it was really interesting um not only because as you said you know i mean lvmh is bigger than the entire recorded music business in terms of you know gross revenue um which is interesting when you when you learn about a company you've never heard of that's bigger than the entire industry that you're in like if your eyebrows don't go up then and you're not curious then i don't know what's wrong with you so i that happened to me but also there was something to me what they did fit both with my values and what i believe about the physics of the internet so on a value side like the the um you know the investment thesis of lvmh is we back creativity with operational efficiency i just love that like i like that the fact that you can become one of the richest people on the planet with that investment thesis gives me like hope in humanity yeah right it makes me i would feel good getting out of bed every morning um if that was my investment thesis but the other was you know i fundamentally believe that the internet moves us from mass market to niche market market right again it moves us from the shopping mall to discord ultimately um and i also believe that it moves us from a world where you know marketing is hyper efficient to a world where quality is hyper efficient and i i i didn't make that up you know i stole both of those things from somebody else so quality to or or marketing to quality came from a guy named umir hawk who wrote a piece in back in 2004 called the blockbuster versus the snowball and what he was pointing out and i've said this many times but you know so i apologize if anyone including you are hearing me repeat myself but if you and i are making a new movie in the old world you know we're not trying to make citizen kane we're trying to get people to go to theater a instead of theater b right because it was limited distribution there's only so many movies at the theater on the weekend right so on some level we don't care if it's a great film if you if you if we get your butt in the seat um and so if we've got an extra two million dollars do we spend that money making the movie better or putting you know the actors face on the cups at mcdonald's right like you spend that money marketing is hyper efficient not quality but in the internet in the world of the internet where consumers have unlimited choice it's the inverse right so if we have some extra money we're gonna you know like look whether it's like house of cards or transparent or stranger things or what all of these things got traction not because of the incredible marketing that was done about them it was all word of mouth and that's that's quality and you know that's where quality is is is hyper efficient as opposed to to marketing and you know there there's there's arguments to be made there for sure but i think generally speaking that's true and the the when i looked at lvmh's business what i saw was a collection of niches that are focused on quality and i can tell you they are genuinely focused on quality i was sitting in the meeting when they were launching rihanna's beauty brand and ben not i know it was like it was like look i know the marketing is going to work guys so you don't even need to show it to me um i want to know is the product quality because this thing's going to it's rihanna it's going to it's going to shoot out of a canon no matter what the product is but do we have a business in 15 years that's the question and we only have a business in 15 years if the product is super high quality um and and this is this is real it's not [ __ ] at lvmh right um you know michael burke who's the ceo of louis vuitton he says everyone in this company has taken an oath against short-term revenue so he's being it's a little tongue-in-cheek when he says it sure but there's a this is real in in that in that company they i mean for me coming from like technology and startup world when they told me that like they take a 100-year time horizon on their brands i laughed yeah i was like you know come on they're like no no we're serious yeah i was like oh [ __ ] wow okay that is you know that's commitment to to quality and i was like this works online i know this works on the internet guys like you haven't really invested here but focusing on quality and creativity in niches works and they know that the way that you you grow that company is not to double the size of louis vuitton it's to buy remova and you know and grow it and to do that you know across you know many other brands you grow breadth not you know not not vertical so anyway that that's yeah and and what i realized and the good news for me at lvmh was that my experience in music you know kind of applied to culture generally right it was like oh cool i i'm actually i actually am a student of how the internet is changing culture and not just a student of how the internet is changing music um and and so i i found my i found my way there i want to dive a little deeper on both your time maybe at apple and then at lvmh and then we'll fully go to ledger so on the music side i've become really interested in this sort of history of streaming and i'm a very at the beginning of my journey of being a student of all that but like i recently learned that spotify isn't profitable and really has these like fixed revenue models because of their negotiations with colombia like all these big music studios that means like they don't have a clear path for profitability unlike an amazon for example who wasn't profitable but was able to get there so i'm curious like you moved to apple music and or really led apple music like the transition is my understanding from like an itunes to an apple music apple moved to streaming it was it in 2014 or so do i have that right they bought us in 2014 we launched apple music in 2015. can you contextualize like the the environment at that time because so spotify launched in 2011 was going really well it was doing very well do you think three years time for them to like start this move to streaming was like a long time like were they slow to adapt to the new environment or are you like no this was a massive company they actually moved very quickly given what a what a big company they are no i think i mean first of all i think spotify started in 2009 2006 but they didn't come to the us until 2011. ah okay okay um well there you go yeah the i mean let's look at it this way i think you know what what's interesting is that you know the music business was growing like crazy up until 2000 to you know the 2000 um time zone when when you know you had napster and you had kazaa and limewire and all these these peer-to-peer things and it really like punctured the the balloon and you know punctured their business model balloon but still recording music was a relatively small business and you know it's interesting like people have so many misconceptions about the music business because it's such a hit driven business and what they see is superstars and they and that makes it feel huge but but there are lots of ways that it's both small and very long long tail so you know i think you know so if you go with the history of the music business you go back into the 70s when things were huge but they weren't that big you know the average person wasn't buying a lot of music it was still a relatively niche industry but compact discs really like allowed the music industry to grow you know and but it also made the music business kind of unhealthy because they became you know as soon as the music business went from being sold in like little record stores like mom and pop record stores to being sold at walmart best buy um etc it became much bigger but also like much more um about you know artists like britney spears and the backstreet boys that you might buy at the checkout at you know best buy or walmart then about kind of like the music business that we kind of feel is this like you know the the music business that we want to save and preserve and and that would have also been mtv right also exploded that like you know then it becomes about the dancing and britney and madonna throughout the 80s and 90s mtv was a huge driver of this sort of hit driven music business you know you already had a hit driven business because of radio and then mtv really like you know pushed that to the max you know you had this the confluence of things because you had mtv compact discs which were like you know a very durable you know piece of thing that you could like put in a discman and your distribution distribution through like walmart best buy et cetera but so that that's why the music is when you look at the chart of music business growth like the 90s are just explosive and then it falls off a cliff in in 200. i'm sorry in 2000. so you then what you realize is like you know and a lot of artists i talked to at the time the chief of which you know adam young from the beastie boys rest in peace you know his entire like you know thought on the music business post 2000 was couldn't happen to a nicer group of people like you know you know he he couldn't have cared any less because you know the whole thing was kind of over inflated you know to begin with so then the question was just what comes next and i the part that's interesting here and and to try to bring it back to the topic of the show for me the internet was a revolution of information crypto nfts is a revolution of value right and these are these are quite different things music is primarily information right if you're like what is it that we listen to it's culture it's it's information um and and that got completely disrupted you know it got you know newspapers got disrupted and music and you know the same way like once distribution is trivial the distribution of information is trivial and that kind of product that you were selling which is kind of the you know the noise that music makes um you know that's no longer scarce um so then the question was okay well what's the business model behind that and how do we support it from for me and others including like mark geiger dave goldberg there were lots of us in the early 2000s who had this very unpopular notion that it would be subscription it'd be somewhere between five and ten bucks a month and if we could just get that to scale that you know there would be a healthy kind of overall music business and you know that's been both true and not true um i think that in some ways the labels have always been their own worst enemies and you know they've they've really tried to it's you know i i i when i moved here universal music group which is the biggest record label is owned by a french company vivendi so when i moved here to france seven years ago i became friendly with the people the top of vivendi and and my advice to them was stop squeezing spotify right if you do you're just gonna push them away from music and into things like podcasts right which have a completely different um you know structure and you know it's what's it's what's happened because you know really like everyone should be interested in growing the subscriber base of music you know to be billions of people as opposed to you know trying to get another two percentage points out of spotify but it's true that you know the business sucks um you know and i saw this you know when i was at yahoo when i was at beach music i mean the cfo of yahoo when i was running yahoo music told me she was like ian the problem is is that the more money you make the worst are or the worse yahoo's margin is you know when they really liked a business like yahoo news which had five employees and you know 90 profit margins as opposed to a business like yahoo music which had 250 employees and gave 75 percent of our revenue directly to record labels right and that was but you know between r between record labels and publishers that was what we had at beats music apple music spotify um you know etc you know you're giving the vast majority of your profits back to the record labels um and who knows what they're doing with it uh you know it's not transparent between them and them and the artists generally so you've got this like it's just not the value chain that i was hoping for you know and and back in 2000 2001 rob lord and i started a new company called media code and what we always talked about was a loosely coupled media value chain um and man it's it's crazy i feel like between media code topspin like i you know every day is groundhog day for me in nft world you know so many of these ideas that are just coming back you know how do you how do you make an ecosystem that's you know more artist friendly um more loosely coupled more decentralized um one where you know like four or three big media companies don't have all the leverage you know etc and and you know look i mean this is also why i was interested in leaving the music business like an oligopoly of apple spotify youtube and amazon is it's not a healthy industry um it's not fun it's not exciting you know to be to be at any of those companies you know having a pissing contest with the one of the three record labels on the other side leave that to somebody else um you know i think i think that's where this frontier that that we're participating in now which is you know driven by artists driven by consumers um full of choice um you know technologically decentralized and loosely coupled like this feels you know like a much better direction in evolution you mentioned topspin earlier which is a company you founded and you mentioned like wasn't commercially successful in that you raised more money than you ultimately sold the business for but as a concept it feels deeply relevant to so much that has happened but especially what's going on web three and so my understanding of topspin is it was really a place to connect artists to fans and to allow artists to monetize their their fan base more directly and go direct to fans with merchandise or whatever they might have wanted to do like what what are your biggest takeaways or what were your biggest takeaways from that business that maybe you're able to bring into this new creator economy era of web 3. i mean look at what um trent resner did uh with he released a record called ghosts i want to say it was 2008 and as a consumer you had a you had a multitude of options you could download half the record for free you could buy the whole digital album for five dollars you could buy the cd for 15 you could buy the vinyl for i think there was a 30 version and then there was a 300 version and he sold out of the 300 versions immediately um and then used that money to make the 300 versions for the fans and you know it was it really was groundbreaking because the music industry was saying like you damn kids stop stealing from us and please buy our music for 99 cents and trent just flipped the script and he said um hey how big a fan are you you know show me and and you know some people said i want it for free right um but like some people are like trent i'm a gigantic fan what do you want from me like let's go if you've got a better product i want to buy it um and not only better but collectible etc so now now look at you know i think like the simplest thing that should be happening right now with um you know with music and nfts i mean i would love it if somebody rebuilt band camp and had it owned by the artists now that band camp is owned by epic um kudos to those guys you know but like let's let's um let's let's let's start the clock again and have it be owned by artists and look at what you can do on any bandcamp page uh i can stream the album for free i can buy the digital download for eight bucks or whatever i can buy the compact disc for 15 i can buy the vinyl for 30. why not like you know just whatever you know if you've got if you've got 200 people that would want to buy an nft from you well okay make 100 of them and sell it for whatever the right price is um you know now let that be like my way that on my gallery page i can show how much i love your band and make that be the the token that gets me into your you know your your world um another thing that we did at topspin with somebody who is very plugged into to web three mike shinoda have you had mike on the show i haven't no but i i know him and not personally yeah i i know it was work yeah i know it would be great to have him on yeah he'd be a really fantastic guest and but i mean mike invented this [ __ ] like you know we talk about this whenever you know he's too humble to say that but if you look at the linkin park fan club from you know 2010 it it looked like a token gated community right you could um you could buy so when we would do ticket sales for linkin park which we did uh together at topspin um you know you it worked like this day one was for annual fan club members day two was for monthly fan club members day three was for anyone who had ever bought anything from the linkin park online store and day four was the public sale it reminds you of anything yeah i mean mike shinoda invented this [ __ ] um and you know and and that's so you're right i mean it's it's very relevant in that way what we have now is just better technology to do that i'll tell you one more story about topspin that i think is relevant that's great um you know the direct-to-fan story the band the pixies you know the pixies disappeared in whatever year it was but they come back in you know 2009 and they're like hey is anything different you're like yeah world's a little different now um you know like let's uh let's tell you about it so what we did with with the pixies was you know they had this little live ep that they wanted to sell and we were like no don't don't sell it let's let's give it away and they're like are you crazy and i'm like look we did the math for him like you sell the cp you're gonna make what 30 grand okay i was like i think we can get you know 100 000 people on an email list if we give it away you don't know who your fans are because you've been gone from the scene for 15 years you know let's like rebuild your list so we gave the ep a i think we put 150 000 people on on the mailing list in like two months maybe less and then we rented our own venues so the band rented the troxie in london and another theater in la which by the way we almost like got sued by ticketmaster for doing like we're really playing a fire in the music business when you let a band go completely direct to their fans and you cut out the promoter and you cut out everybody everybody else but then the only thing we did was send an email to those 150 000 people and we sold the tickets out you know really instantly and we we had we had the first um iphone ticket scanner like everything was kind of internal to topspin and and the bands but but you know to me like all of this i wish i'd had you know kind of this this concept of token gating in those days right i mean to do all of this with just like email lists and spam and spam filters and you know it's like it was you're sort of doing it with one arm time tied behind your back and now you just have like such better tools you know to do all of this stuff with um you know even when i think about customer care you're like you know you're selling people a collectible that's like you know we did david byrne and brian eno and we made these like cool little tins but it took us forever to get them made and so you know you're dealing every day with people like hey where's my thing and you're like oh it's coming i promise you know what if we could have just given them an nft that they could have been trading in the meantime like look you don't want it you don't want to wait anymore well someone else wants to give you one e for it get rid of it if you want it'd be so great to have those tools so anyway yeah i think it's super relevant and you bring that all the way forward i mean lvmh same thing like imagine i don't know i don't know if i don't know they might but i wouldn't do you know louis vuitton supreme dropped the way they did it how'd they do it well you don't know people line up at the store and you know you put your best customers in a big line in front of your store um you know i would i would sell those things you know i i would sell them as nfts and then let them trade in an open market like you know i don't i i've i bought a louis vuitton supreme skateboard case um in that in that um because i you know could i got no discount by the way but it's okay it's appreciated in value and i could sell it at christie's now but imagine if that futon supreme skate case instead of being you know locked away in storage somewhere um was an nft and it was on the market i don't know maybe someone in japan wants to give me 400 grand for it i would have i would have hit accept on that offer but but this is the difference like you know when you're you're not yet putting these items into this like always on always you know always liquid um global market yet and and i think that's you know there's so many things that we've done in these culture businesses that are going to be you know way better and more exciting um you know when when you have this you know kind of it's not just that it's a digital artifact it's a digital artifact that is part of an always-on marketplace um a true peer-to-peer always-on marketplace you said lvmh kind of called you out of the blue you're at i guess apple music at that time you internally were wanting to maybe get out of the music business but sort of feeling like maybe i'm pigeonholed now into music do you know like why lvmh honed in on you and what they thought about your background would be the right fit for for them this like luxury brand that isn't really like youth street culture from which you came you know i it came it came through a recruiter but i mean i have to say like i'm a pretty weird choice for the job yeah um and you know they had you know so i you know i'll just give them credit you know first of all i'm still working with them still consulting for lvmh um i consider them you know friends and you know i'm very proud to be kind of a part of that extended extended family um you know i still i was just you know i sat and talked about nfts with ben i don't know in july i think i don't think it was june is that the father or the one of the sons the father who's like 75 or something at this point exactly yeah oh my gosh and by the way he gets this you know far more than any ceo that that i've ever if i enter what's so amazing about that in like what kind of i understand about lvmh is like you have basically somebody who's a capital capital allocator on the order of like a like a warren buffett like just incredible at allocating capital coupled with this brand building ability and this ability to understand like brand equity and culture which buffett doesn't really have and he would be the first to say that right like he knows how to allocate capital but he doesn't have to mcdonald's every day yeah exactly exactly so to have or not or i always forget i don't know how to browser name but like have both those pieces it's just it's incredible i i honestly like i mean i i'm i uh i'm i'm still amazed you know he he um the whole family by the way um the the so i'll answer your question by by sort of commenting on what you just said as well you know bernardo wrote a book once upon a time called the creative imperative you know because he believes deeply in the power of creativity one of my favorite things is to see bernardo no with peter mourinho i don't even know who peter mourinho is he's get i don't i don't want to get it wrong architect interior designer he he designs the stores many of the stores for for lvmh um if you search for a photo of him you'll find it you'll find many pictures peter wearing um you know his leather vest and his leather hat um he's significantly less tall than than i don't know and you know i've never i've known ben i don't know for seven years now and i've never seen him in anything except a dior suit um i've seen him in you know many colors of of dior suits um including purple um you know but never in anything but a dior suit and like so him standing next to peter mourinho is really something else but you can also tell you know when they are you can tell special that relationship is and i i don't think i'm giving anything away by saying this i think if anything i'm just humanizing um you know somebody who's the top of the forbes list to say this guy genuinely like you know creativity is where his brain lives you know his wife is a is a concert pianist um his kids you know all play piano extraordinarily well um you know everything that you've seen alexander and frederick do around punks and apes is them because they wanna they're they're in this culture i mean what alex has done with tiffany and punks is really cool and really clued in in my in my perspective and it's it comes from his brain you know it's um because that that's just how how they you know how they how they move um you know ben i don't know gave me a tour of his open seat page you know like himself he pulls out his phone he's like you want to see my collection yes of course i do um and and it's uh you know and but that's shouldn't be surprising because i mean it is surprising but when you realize like these guys are are they care a lot about creativity it's where they live you know i mean who put kanye at the foundation louis vuitton miss rono his wife and alex once upon a time before my time and um it's awesome like it's really really cool so to answer your question i think on some level um you know you you you come with a brand if you work at apple it's sort of like you know how it is when you're hiring you know nobody got fired for buying ibm right so you know you're hiring from apple it's like okay it's got this sort of like oh yeah in reality i was only at apple for a year people still like consider me like an apple guy i was there for 12 months um you know so i don't consider myself an apple guy but you know i'm okay to have to take the brand but i also think that you know knowing now much more about alex in particular and and his father you know ben i don't know is the guy who you know hired galiano on the spot when galiano walked into his office like no shirt but a vest and sandals right and you know because he doesn't care that i have tattoos on my fingers and you know and i'm a bit of a weirdo he what he sees is he's like this this this guy is you know is doing this thing where he's dissecting um you know culture relative to technology and and we need that and i find that valuable and i love that you know when i was when i was with mr arnold you know within the last 60 days he was like i want you to i want you to keep coming in here to tell me what you see you know so that's it that's it it's like you know i think that those guys want me around for the same reason you want me on the show you know it's um and i love that i feel and i like that i'm i'm still me i'd still you know ride a skateboard and you know i do everything else i've always done um i still get to be me but you know passion can take you someplace i i feel super lucky coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform for dows and crypto businesses who

could pick your brain for an hour on any one of your chapters of your career alone but let's for the in the spirit of time let's move to to ledger here and then if we have a little extra time i might try and go back to lvmh because there's i would just love to hear a little bit more tactically about what you did to bring this sort of very traditional luxury brand digital and what they're doing now with nfts and everything but to move to ledger um i don't know the best place to start here i mean i think maybe let's start with like what do you think are the biggest misconceptions or that that people have around like crypto security and maybe that's sort of simultaneous to like what are the biggest mistakes people make around crypto insecurity you know it's the good news is i think people i fee you can feel people becoming more educated unfortunately a lot of that's you know happening the hard way but i mean you can see it in the numbers you know where where you've got where you have communities that have value they use ledger right so that's why you see a higher concentration of ledger in communities like board apes or proof or you know when you've got because you know you think about it that's how these communities work you know there's value there's community inevitably somebody gets wrecked and then everyone's like yo get a ledger right so i think it it spreads that way because you know i really think um that the founders of ledger seven years ago they were just on exactly the right path you know i don't know i mean their their conviction when they were they had very strong conviction all the way through has has often not been popular right they are believers in digital assets um generally not just one digital asset they're believers in digital assets generally um including bitcoin but not only bitcoin they're they're believers in the technology um they're believers that um if this digital asset thing is real then security is going to be a big problem um because self-custody is is the jam self-custody is the reason if not self-custody why crypto right um and they've always kind of stayed on that course they've said we believe in digital assets we believe self-custody is a new freedom and a new right and because of that security is paramount and i think that that part of it is just being on the right side of history right there have been so many people along the way who have been willing to compromise on either security or self-custody for whatever reason they made up in their head was an okay one and ledger said no we're never going to compromise on security and self-custody period because we think that these things you know we're in for the long term and we think over the long term you know these things are going to matter so i think the biggest the biggest misconceptions are that uh you know phone security is good enough you know it's good enough you know and you know if if you don't have if you don't have like an ios app how are you going to get to scale you know so that's the question i wanted to ask you on the self custody front like do you think it's a limiting factor because we hear so much about this won't go mainstream because seed phrases are a pain and i'm sympathetic to that view i have to say so if you disagree persuade me otherwise well i to me it's like saying it's like i've i've just heard this a million times right like you know i'm old um as we've discussed you know and i just remember really well the people in 1999 that were like this internet's never going to scale um everyone's never going to have broadband and you know oh you know i mean you know remember that like you know when the iphone came out apple stock went down not up because everyone's never going to pay 500 for a smartphone right um you know yeah they were right everyone's not going to pay 500 for a smartphone they're going to pay 1200 right and it's the same thing here like you can get you know the best security on the planet for 80 bucks so i don't see hardware wallets as a barrier at all right i mean you tell me you're going to buy a 1200 smartphone you won't spend 80 bucks to make it secure oh come on and you know and and the and and over time you know over in in every industrial transformation you have an unbundling and a rebundle right i was looking for my nano it's oh it's here oh i think i had mine close to me too you know this is you know this is the un the unbundling um right the you know the unbundling is that my hardware device my security device is separate from my phone yeah and ultimately there will be a rebundling wherever you want and but but this device is incapable of protecting digital you're listening to this you're showing your iphone your iphone is incapable of protecting your digital assets exactly you know it you know and and so the yeah your your iphone your phone or your computer is technically incapable of of protecting your wealth someday it will be um that's a huge point in my opinion because right now there's a lot obviously we talk about this ad nauseam in this community that's like really clunky about the nft digital asset experience and i would say including ledger right like i was i was like in in honor of this interview i was like i should probably you know every every couple of months or whatever i do my transfer of stuff to ledger and so i was doing last night and i was like this is a paint you know like it's not just my little thing it's also this cord and then the cord doesn't plug directly into my mac so i have to have a you know a thing that converts it so i can plug it in yeah exactly i gotta have my converter with me for it and then it's this little screen and i freak out because there's you know a two minute lag before my stuff hits the hardware wallet and oh i forgot to sign the transaction on my hardware while so i'm wondering why you know it's like kind of a it's kind of a pain i totally believe all of that is that's it's you guys have to do the actual work you know but it's deeply surmountable and i'm not worried in the least that that's going to become a super saiyan yeah i mean in 1999 it was like a dial up and busy signals and your roommate picks up the phone and you lose your internet connection and it's slow and i mean i had an att executive tell me in 2002 that we'll never be able to do video on the internet yeah that's so wild i love hearing these stories because it is so reassuring because you're like it feels like such an inevitability in hindsight and yeah if if the problem is technology and user interface you can bet that it will be solved but so let me say this this is the unlock you've you've delivered for me is so all of that i was like yeah this experience will get better but the thing that always felt like a sticking point is this like damn 12 24 word seed phrase that i'm like writing on this little card me who loses everything is like oh my god i can't lose this little card you know somebody come in my house and steal like whatever that felt like a bigger obstacle and and you know and i've heard you talk about like people have had their seat phrases stolen out of their one pass i'm like oh my god not even one pass is safe is it are you saying that that will ultimately we will find a way to create like an operating system or something on our smartphone that will allow us to securely save that stuff or it's a it's a it's a great question um and i think that you're right i mean it is the scariest part and if you're not scared about your 24 word seed phrase then you don't understand you don't get it exactly and so i think though you know i would start by saying this you know digital assets are a new invention it's a new invention a new human invention and um so what that means is we have digital scarcity which means you have digital stuff that you might lose and and so because of that security is paramount period and that and that's by the way whether it's on the you know whether you're using custodian or you're doing self-custody security is paramount right so your security between you and the custodian the custodian security you know how secure is that place you know if you don't want to trust yourself you want to trust someone else how secure are they by the way you should be worried about the enterprise security of the nft projects you invest in you know is that nft are those smart contracts protected by chrome and meta mask or are they protected by a nano or and if that if the if one person in the dow gets hit by a bus is it over like these are important questions that i don't think we've really grappled with as a as a as a um as a community yet because you have this new invention that we're just not like that familiar with yet that you know this the concept of a digital a scarce digital good that you could lose so there's no way to escape you know sort of the concern of security is my point you know like you'll never get past the concern of security when you have i mean you know we've seen die hard you know getting a billion in gold bars out of a building is really difficult right but getting a billion in eath is pretty damn easy it's as easy as getting you know a thousand any actually you know so secure therefore security will always be a challenge i do think that the management of that will get better and better so we're working on something right now for seed phrase backup um you know i shouldn't say what it is it's incredibly difficult problem to solve um you know but that's how good companies are made you you solve incredibly difficult problems extraordinarily well um you know and and but but yeah i'm i'm with you like i always like make the joke like i have you know the world's most futuristic money and to secure it i like you know etched uh into a steel tablet um like a cave person right um but but i think that that is you know that part's not going away and and in terms of what i mean is the ability to custody your own assets is extraordinarily powerful the ability to write down 24 words and use them as a bookmark and cross a border with all of your wealth is really really really powerful and there are many things that we do and always will hold in safe in self-custody like our passport and our our you know our comic books and our records and you know not all of them are extraordinary value you know like in the 80s when you're when somebody smashed your window and stole your you know your cd collection you know it wasn't like you weren't going to pay your rent next month but it was like heartbreaking you know i mean if somebody stole like every tezos nft that i'd ever collected you know i wouldn't i'd still be able you know to pay my rent next month but my heart would be broken because i care a lot about those even if the value of them isn't you know isn't huge and but i but self-custody is what makes sense with those so i think yes we need to make that um seed phrase kind of back up much much much easier and and and there are a few ways you know of of doing that and and like i said we we want to you know we want to start to you know start to make that possible um but i also just think it's like over time the power of this technology is that you know we go from you know web 1.0 which is username and password to you know web 2.0 which is login with facebook log in with google log in with twitter you know to web 3.0 which is you know you log in with your wallet you log in with your assets and you know if you visit a metaverse you take your stuff with you and the winners are not the ones that lock you in because they own you and they own your data but they're the ones who provide you the best experience around the stuff that you own i think that promise is so huge that you know ledger and others will improve you know that the user experience around security and self-custody um and and that will you know we will get there just like we've gotten there you know you know i remember in college like can you imagine if you had fiber at your house you know it's just like a pipe dream and now elon's got satellites that will deliver you um you know deliver you 400 megabits down anywhere similarly like technology will solve this our approach is to never compromise on security and self-custody but drive toward ease of use so that's you know that's where that's two other like maybe solves here one that strikes me it's borrowing it from the web two world is just insurance right it's not as if your bank can't get hacked or your assets couldn't be stolen from a bank physically or in in other ways right but the reason i feel better about it is like there's fdic insured and i recognize the irony and being like well i trust the government to kind of bail out my assets and in a world where we're talking about decentralization but is that a potential route here and the second is like biological hacks like you know as as uh you know my fingerprint gets better at unlocking things or my facial recognition gets better unlocking things is that another way to protect it where you know it's much harder to tack through something if you need to feel my exact fingerprint yeah i mean great great question so one at a time um i think you know insurance look if beyonce can insure her legs then you know we can we can insure our crypto at the same time like fdi insurance it wasn't there for a long time a lot of people had to get wrecked before fdi fdic insurance was a thing in the u.s um and it's got a limit it's got an upper bound right so you know i would i would think that yes over time insurance certainly um plays a role in this industry but it probably does have upper limits and you know you probably hedge your losses and other you know your risks in other ways just like you know everyone does um you know and you know no no millionaire just has a million dollars in cash sitting you know under a bed right you know so i think we'll have you know this is this is this is the future your money's going to be in in many places um and that'll and that'll be a way of hedging risk and many of them will be insured in different ways and and risk will get hedged i think biometrics are are really a mistake for the foreseeable future in terms of in terms of of um security it's just you know i don't i i love that my ledger is useless to someone if i am dead um that is that is a great feature of the product um you know and that if i put the passcode into it three times wrong it bricks and i don't keep 24 words you know in my apartment on my person with me when i'm traveling etc right like these are security features and um you know we need to we need to you know really make sure we're again we won't compromise on security or or self-custody so you definitely won't see biometrics in our devices anytime soon so let me ask a couple specific practical questions if i'm really serious about security how many ledger devices should i have that's a great question um i think it's very personal right and it depends on exactly exactly what you're doing because you know one one thing you know you might you might want to have you know one you know in a ultra secure place um not anywhere near your house or whatever that turns out to be that has like a bag that you're planning to hold for the next 15 years okay if you're that person that makes perfect sense and you know you might want to have one that is your mint wallet and one that is your your vault wallet for your nfts um you know you know there's there's a i think it really depends on on the usage you know you might want to have have one have one for different assets or for you know like just for ease of use you know i talked to to somebody a friend who works with a lot of artists and he was like oh i love ledger i've got 10 ledgers in front of me right now and i was like why yeah just tell me why do you have 10 ledgers oh because i work with lots of artists on lots of different projects and the first thing i do when i work with an artist is i fire up a new ledger because i don't want to intermingle you know anyone's assets you know it's like a way for him of kind of like just mentally keeping them separate like convenience-wise keeping them separate but also you know minimizing the risk if something happens to one it doesn't happen to everybody um you know so i think it's i think it's really you know really specific um but certainly i think you wanna in the world of nfts you want to at least have a vault and a mint wallet so two ledgers one that connects one that you kind of use as you're like i'm going to actively mint something wallet and then one that acts as you're like this is my kind of savings wallet correct and the other thing that i would do i would recommend doing it's not it's not necessary if you've got um the 24 words in a safe place but i find it convenient to have a backup of of each as well so you set up a second device with the same seed phrase and now like if something happens you you know you run it through and we've seen everything like you run it through the washing machine sometimes it survives that sometimes it doesn't i've seen dogs you know eat ledgers you know if that if something like that happens then you know it's easy you just grab another one and you know and you've got you know you're in your you're right in business and there's no additional security risk by having two you know some people tell me they're like oh i would never carry it i'd be afraid of losing it okay to lose it i think that's this misconceptions people don't realize that assets are not in the ledger they're on the blockchain the ledger is just your key to get to those assets exactly and and and with ledger you know i mean you know you can it even it's funny because even um someone who was new to the company um they were like they were like ian you you've i found your ledger you know and you know i like left it in a conference room and i was like oh just throw it on my desk right and i came in the next day and she was like the product's really secure isn't it i was like yeah she's like because you weren't stressed at all like you lost your ledger and you just you weren't stressed i was like no i wasn't stressed i didn't even think about it i slept fine yeah um you know and and like that's i think that is something that that you know people don't realize so you know i mean really if you're if you're afraid of losing it well just have five set up with the same seed phrase and carry it around with you if you lose it okay you lost it do you keep any assets in in a metamask wallet i don't um that's not true i i do have um one i have one wallet that i will occasionally use to do listings from just because i won't list anything from um any of my real wallets like i won't list anything on openc from any of my real wallets um so i actually don't sell that often yeah um but but if i don't when i do i sell with metabolism i do it from uh yeah i do it from a burner um i could do it from a burner ledger too you know like more of like the mint wallet but i just i just don't so i yeah i have a i do have one metamask thing that i'll like put something in if i'm just gonna you know try to sell it because i i think my big thing is for assets that i know i'm holding for a long time which like you is the vast majority of them i'm like okay no brainer i'll put them in in ledger but it is kind of a pain to be like trying like trying to do like the metamask ledger integration and i'm trying to transfer between wallets or sell something like you know when i just want to quick make a sale for example because a floor price is pumping like that's where i feel like it's it's more of a pain yeah i personally don't find it i mean i you know punch in the passcode and do the approve and you know it's it's for me there's there for me there's two um you know major usability points and one is we already talked about the seed phrase and there's two big hurdles there one i've got to conceptually understand it and two i have to go through the flow right so you know i've got a punch back in every word and that that's that's you know it's it's a little time consuming but also the cognitive load is is high and the other is that connection to web3 and that's why you know we're we're working on ledger connect because i think that that kind of cross-chain connection to web3 that throws alerts when things don't look right you know like that's a that's a really really really big problem um so you know for me that's why like the mint wallet uh connected to metamask you know i i you know last summer we had a huge problem with metamask that's been fixed um you know we announced at ecc this year that we're you know now the metamask mobile will now support ledger um you know you've got good options with uh coinbase wallet uh so ledgerlive metamouse coinbase wallet um phantom wallet you've got lots of great support for ledger i really don't think there's a good reason you know not to be using a hardware wallet at all times um because if you you know from a user experience perspective it's punch in your passcode and hit and you know approve that you know so i think the the to me the far superior additional security outweighs that that additional um you know going through i mean look last week there were two zero days patched on ios and another zero day hack patched on chrome you know it's we're nowhere close to these platforms being secure enough to store digital value nowhere close and anyone i always say this but any if i highly recommend everyone to read this is how they tell me the world ends um if you're not properly paranoid that book will do it to you um it's extraordinary extremely well written our moms could read it and enjoy it um and uh and and it gives you a very kind of accurate picture of where we are with respect to cyber crime and security but you know look we're we're going to be able to say this year was the biggest year for cyber crime every year for the rest of our lives yeah you know it's sad but it's true and we're moving into a world where you know i mean there's to me there's no question that you know 15 years from now um when i travel from france to the us i won't be giving them a piece of paper that shows my identity right you know i will be a verifiable credential i'll be proving to them the eye that i am the owner of the wallet that contains that document you know i mean come on like look at what we did with through covid absolutely like all these papers we filled out like oh i don't know if cool also the absurdity of just even the vaccine card that's the most forgivable thing ever i'm like oh i took a picture of a card and i'm now in all these restaurants i'm like do you actually even care no i didn't what was the uk it looked like it looked like i i was picturing that like my daughter was in nursery school and she'd gone to like station one to play with um you know one game and like station two she went like you know station one she shot the water in the clown's mouth station two she will like fished for goldfish station three she bowled and like got the three stamps that's what it looked like it really looked like but this is my point like this like i was saying you know at nftnyc the technology i used to get into fast yeah was was better than the technology i used to get into the country that is wild that won't last forever you know what i mean that gap gets closed over time yeah when you think about for ledger like growth and you talk about these communities like proof or or apes or or you know whatever that are probably have a much higher saturation or penetration of ledger in their communities like is your target right now just reaching more people who hold digital assets or you guys like wow our penetration for digital asset holders is pretty good like we need to be in the fight of just like getting more people digital assets to to grow sales yeah no it's a it's a great question i i really think um i don't think we need to bring people into the world of digital assets as ledger i think that i think that's going to happen very naturally because there's real a lot of real value for people you know i mean there will be you know and i think we'll do it on we'll participate in that you know because as we do things like the ledger card you know the ledger credit card which allows you to live a bankless life you know once once you've got that kind of full loop where oh look i can get paid into my ledger and i can buy things my ledger card well that'll definitely bring people into the space but i think generally people are going to come in because you know they're either curious about assets like bitcoin and ethereum and and people like bff will do the do the work of introducing you know new people to the space people come in because of things they're passionate about you know their favorite artist their favorite brand they become curious about generative art whatever it is there are a lot of different things that are going to draw people into this into the space i don't really think that that's our job i think our job is to be there when they get there um ideally to be the best on-ramp you know i'm super happy if somebody walks into a best buy you know we're at at all the best buy stores in in america now they walk into a best buy and they're like you know i don't know anything about this digital asset world but i've heard about this company i think it's a good brand my friend told me it's great it's 80 bucks i'm in i got i would love to be a gateway in that way you know but i think the opportunity is still huge you know hundreds of millions of people hold digital assets tens of millions of people use metamask every month we've sold five five million ledgers you know there's a we got to close that gap yeah you know so we get these like decent concentrations in groups like board apes or proof because there's a lot of value and there's a tight-knit community and word travels fast within those little communities but then you look at a community like bff and you know our penetration in that community is much much much lower and that tells you exactly the work that you need to do you've got to get the kind of security education in in that in more of those newbies up to the level of the people who are more experienced and holding more value and that's why we spend so much time and energy on education and you know ledger academy is um i think number two behind finance uh in terms of of being like an educational resource for the crypto community and you know it's a it's a great it's great for us because educated people become ledger customers so i don't have to try to sell you ledger i can just teach you about security and you're going to be like i should get a ledger yeah yeah i is it's great um you know so yeah i think it's um i think i think that's our that's our role you all put out some great videos i know you personally do where you you know like a friend call you and you know ask a security question and you'll answer the security question um to close here i want to talk about what's coming down the pike for ledger i know there's some cool things you have coming up um an upcoming brick drop i'd love for you to tease that out i saw some of like the trailer videos for that on on your youtube as well uh this is where i always wonder like am i is it is it does it does it mean too much to me to mean anything to other people you know because if you were an artist a musical artist and you came to play me a record and i loved it that'd be really bad news i'd be like i got terrible news i like your record you know i i don't have mainstream tastes so and and so the fact that i think brick is so awesome might might be bad news yeah um you know but but again hopefully like we're moving to a world where people around the world you know appreciate um you know there's a there's a critical mass of people who appreciate everything yeah in a way so explain to folks what it is yeah so what we've done is this so we launched ledger market back in july ledger market is the first time we've really been able to connect what ledger does end to end because you know for a long time you know we sell ledger enterprise to banks and governments and exchanges um and then we sell you know end users ledger devices right but this is like what you have is you have in the world of nfts you have new people coming into the space who are going need to go from zero to one whether it's an lvmh or a caring or it's a brick right and i'll tell you what brick is in a second but like i said i think probably you know if you if you surveyed the nft projects that you know and love their enterprise security is probably pretty bad right a lot of them are probably running without hardware security and some of them like best case scenario are running on a nano which has great security but no governance right so if you know the principal person in that nft project or dao you know dies or loses their seed phrase or whatever like the contracts might fall into the wrong hands you know um and and so you know one is whether you're a newcomer to the space like a brand like a you know an nf you know an lvmh or a carrying or whomever or you're in a you're you're more of a diy project or a dao you need enterprise security the moment you're not an individual but you're a group you need enterprise security so we've had to kind of adapt our enterprise security to not just be for banks and governments and and these guys but to really also be for a brand or an individual i mean or a project like uh you know dead fellas bomb squad etc that sort of thing um and then the other thing that we've done is you know a lot of people they they need help getting to market they they've got to get from zero to one they have zero digital assets they know they're going to have a lot more in the future how do i get there so that's the next step and then they want to like go to consumers and then the consumers also need security so ledger market allows us to do that whole thing you know hey we're going to help you um have great enterprise security we're going to help you get to market and then we're gonna help educate your your end users on security so they don't get wrecked so it's a really nice kind of end-to-end thing um so brick man i don't think i guess i'm not sure what all has been announced but i'll just tell you everything hopefully it's okay um you know brick is is is started by um the guys from trash talk um an incredible uh you know rock band from i don't think it's even accurate just call them a rock band an incredible band from uh from sacramento um and you know these guys have created like there's they've created worlds in their in their like career it's what they do they use like you know the worlds that we grew up in these like punk rock um collectives right as a as as the design and like if you go to babylon in um in los angeles there's an incredible skateboard there plus a little shop that'll remind you of a supreme you know or ex-large back in the day you know you know or even like an incredible bookstore skate shop streetwear shop it's like this is you know it's hard to even describe because what they're really doing is they're purveyors of culture and babylon has become a community center in los angeles you go there you'll find kids i'm not just kids you find people of all walks of life they're telling me there's a guy there who has long dreadlocks and skates with his grandson at babylon it's like literally a community center and so what they're what they're doing is they're building a venue and we're all going to be owners in that venue um and uh you know you're literally buying a brick in you know a future kind of token gated community space um we should check on the timing of okay we can check on the timing i'll make sure we don't like completely screw you over but that's so cool so when you say we all can you connect is this i'm going to buy an nft and it's launched by ledger or it's by owning a ledger i automatically am so by owning a ledger market pass so you know by owning a ledger market pass you're going to be you'll have access to the mint um and then you know and then i think that you know if they don't all if all the ledger market pass owners don't buy one i think there will be a public mint i actually don't don't know the exact um you know mechanics but the owners will be owners of the venue wow and then would you get like special access to the venue then or is there access to the venue you get voting rights you know um and and like you know i've talked to i mean man i i think it's i think it's next week that we're releasing the interview that i did with lee who is the mastermind behind this what a what a guy man i mean and and these are these are what i love about this is i'm seeing the bridge between like these are not like crypto bros right these these are these guys are the real [ __ ] thing um they are people who have you know toured the world in a shitty van and um you know and they're in it for the right reasons what means something to me there's no such thing as the right reasons but for me for me as somebody who grew up with punk rock and skateboarding they're in it for the right reasons and what they really want is to create a community space that is owned by the people who who who frequent it and by the people who want to be associated with it like i don't think it's any kind of secret that you know it even though i live in paris and you know and won't be visiting it often you know they're they're playing a bit on the fact that i'm an old punk rocker and would like to be associated with such a thing right and that's fine that's fine with me i'm happy to be you know we all we do this kind of thing all the time with public radio and politics and you know i mean you know there's there's always ways of i mean or kickstarter or patreon or um sub stack or you know what i mean like it's not so different from you know from from these types of things where you you know where you crowdsource you crowdfund but now you've got this this new tool in your in your quiver you know the new tool is kind of ownership and ownership that's transferable and ownership that um you know allows me to vote um and then so i think that you know again that's why i love it because it it's not it's not futuristic it's not totally new it's not a it's not a 3d metaverse it's um you know it's it's a community center which is about art and education um and you know we we can all be both patrons and owners what's the play from ledger's perspective is it like brand equity like trying to show the kind of brand you are through this partnership what's the what's the goal for ledger in this and working with them on that it's a great question because and it's kind of my fear in a way like i think there some people will be as passionate about brick as i am and some people will be like i don't get it and i don't care which by the way is fine um you know we'll we we have many many many things lined up for ledger market pass owners um the the real thing for ledger is we want to show people that you can have security end to end and it's important um so security on the project side um a go-to-market that doesn't screw your customers that are interested that's not you know bots gas wars etc which is why we partnered with pre-mint and continue to do that and we also care about you know the provenance and who owns the the contract and who's audited the contract and you know these these sorts of things that are that are important but also often get overlooked and then we want you know there to be education about security and self-custody for the end user um so for us ledger market is really just a vehicle to to show put into practice everything that you're kind of preaching so to speak exactly and actually one more thing we also want to create something where you know by being a ledger owner a ledger holder a ledger customer you get value so right now it's ledger market pass but ultimately you know we want every person who buys a ledger to have an opportunity to be involved in these kind of raffles um so you know look maybe for the the broader audiences the the chance of getting selected in a raffle is much lower than if you're a market pass holder but still you know i would love it if you know oh man how did you get in that like really hard to get in mint oh i just i i won the ledger raffle dude that's so cool you know i mean so obviously it's not something i mean scarcity is scarcity you can't give it to everybody um but we i really want to find ways that that you know by being a ledger customer you know you get additional value final piece i think there are other like ledger protein collaborations coming up i think of you guys as like prolific collaborators like i feel like every project that i like follow or i'm interested in has like done cool things with you guys or giving away ledgers to their community etc but what else do you have on the horizon from like a you know collaboration perspective that you can maybe uh share with us here oh man and there's a good one but i don't think i'm allowed to say it can you like give us a hint well we've at ledger open in new york we announced um we announced a number of partnerships we announced you know that we have we've created kind of this pro team which for me comes from being a skateboarder and you know if you haven't watched the bones brigade documentary watch it and then you'll know what it is i'm trying to create in terms of in terms of a pro team but on that pro team are are people like um bobby hundreds um betty and psych dead fellas dan held mike shinoda um you know so these are these are the types of people that you know we're really stoked to work with and it's it's all over i mean dan's really you know a bitcoin guy um and you know that's a super important community for me bitcoin is still the main event um and you know so having dan you know with us and and you know or or we continue to sponsor what bitcoin did with peter mccormick and um you know so we we we want to we want to you know be meaningful in um in these communities i guess you know for me there isn't such a thing as crypto crypto is a collection of communities and you know what i what i know from being a skateboarder is when a brand walks in and does something lame you know it you smell it you know and like my friend and artist jeff mcfettridge he talks about this concept of kind of cultural generosity when you go into a community you want to bring value to the community you want like there i don't want if i come to your house i don't take something home with you i bring you a bottle of champagne you know i want to that's what we want to do with with these communities so i think you know that's that's what we try to do the one of the the nice thing for us is like we can bring education you know i i don't have to like spend a lot of money to bring you education but i can give you a lot of value and you know bobby hundreds is the one who said he's like man when you guys come in to the atom bomb squad community um you know it doesn't feel like you're selling like people are really thankful that you came in and you you know you helped them educated educated and and that's so i think you know i can't really say we have so much coming i've got i've got like amazing um products services and this is you know this is a trick i learned it at apple um which is you know you kind of pop your head out and talk twice a year yeah so we we did um we did ledger open in new york in june and we're gonna do ledger open here in paris in december december 5th i don't think we've sent out to save the dates yet but that is the date you can save the date please come carly will come oh my god parrot i mean twist my arm december 5th so december 5th in paris and we'll have a whole raft of announcements then and between them we'll be doing um ledger market drops the good news is is we get
