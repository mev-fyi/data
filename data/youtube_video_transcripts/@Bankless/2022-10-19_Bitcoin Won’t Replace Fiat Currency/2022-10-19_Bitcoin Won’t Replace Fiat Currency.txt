classic story of Bitcoin replacing Fiat money it's a fundamental misunderstanding of how money works the FED controls your money and they're devaluing your money blah blah blah it's a fantasy story that does help to sustain the price of Bitcoin which results in some notional wealth for a few people but it is not a real thing that said it could allow people to sort of transfer money across borders more easily when there's instability in their home countries so you know we put sanctions on Russia Russian rich people want to get their money out they don't have to carry a physical sack of gold over the Border or anything they can just transfer Bitcoin which is really what gold is all about and so Bitcoin could replace that although I might even bet on something like Monero you know is less traceable than Bitcoin and so so actually that's the the other one I'm thinking of buying as Monero
