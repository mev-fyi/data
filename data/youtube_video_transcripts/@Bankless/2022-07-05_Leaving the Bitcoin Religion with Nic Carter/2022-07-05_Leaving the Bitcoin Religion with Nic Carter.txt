i think bitcoin maximalism is a genuinely like toxic cancerous thing that harms bitcoin and to the extent i can harm that i'm very happy to do my part hey bankless nation this is a pre-recorded state of the nation episode super excited to talk to nick carter in fact david we've already done that nick um i think people have thought of him as a bitcoin maximalist in the past and he recently got lit up by the bitcoin maximalist and is officially i might call it leaving the bitcoin maximalist religion maybe he was never really a part in the first place but people thought he was and uh the first part of this episode we go over that story then we touch on some macro themes we talk a little bit about the bear market we talk about block fi and celsius and the concept of free uh banking that nick has uh been in favor of in the past a lot of great insights from nick in this episode what were some of your thoughts yeah you'll see the intelligence that nick brings to the table in the second half of the show and i think he always frames these things in like austrian economics uh like freebanking like you said uh and like and also the role of gold throughout the world and then he also has this intrinsic interest in bitcoin and so people have associated nick carter as being like okay when he talks about global macro politics when he talks about austrian economics it's coming from the place of a bitcoiner when actually the mistake that was a mistake it was actually coming from the place of nick carter uh and so people have like thought of nick carter as nick carter the bitcoiner or nick carter the bitcoin maximalist when in again in reality is just nick carter uh and so nick when nick and his uh vc fund castle island announces this investment in like this web 3 wallet with identity verification with a wallet base sign in uh the the bitcoiners are like uh the the cyber hornets if you will come and descend upon him uh just by this association that's a super super smart guy who also likes bitcoin therefore as a bitcoin maximalist turns out to not be true the bitcoin culture descends but like it's one story to talk about this as just like this was what was going on on like the crypto twitter meal you during the bear market but the more interesting thing is about the way that bitcoin works as a narrative and this is where we conclude that conversation where there's a relationship between bitcoin the code and the culture that arises on top of it and what how the asset actually manifests in real life and i think it's if you can extrapolate it the listener extrapolate it to the tribe that you're probably in depending on what your chain you're on or the token that you like depending on what d5 app that you enjoy the most you could also find all of these truths in whatever organization that you find yourself a part of so it's one part a story of the hap what happened on crypto twitter recently but it's also something else that you could extrapolate into the wider world of crypto because that's how this thing operates and then we get into nick's very well informed thoughts about the macro world uh this coming decade how is this bear market the same how is it mostly different uh and like what he's doing about it yeah i think this is a story of tribalism it's also a story of bitcoin so if you're really interested in learning more about bitcoin culture as it is in 2022 there's no one that understands it better than nick carter i mean he's kind of a historian of the bitcoin culture world and he's been in the trenches as well so a fantastic episode coming up for you we also wanted to tell you about our friends at juno juno is a crypto friendly banking app you can open a checking account on juno what's funny about this is you're hearing from bank list we are telling you you should go open a bank account but that's exactly what you should do because juno is a d5 friendly a crypto friendly bank account they even allow you to exit your funds to layer two directly does your wells fargo account do that does your bank of america account do that no you need a bank account that is crypto friendly for the 21st century and i think all creative uh crypto natives need something like juno in their lives david what more would you say about junior yeah not only does your wells fargo not give let you like go on to an ethereum layer two straight from your checking account to a layer two in seconds that's crazy also six percent on your usdc ryan what percentage are you getting in your wells fargo account uh well sir i'm making uh point zero one percent in my wells fargo savings account at the moment those are different numbers uh you can also get ether and btc clocking in at three percent as well uh and they also have a mastercard debit card that's metal because everyone likes the metal cards these days uh and so if you sign up with juno and you make your crypto deposit into your crypto side of the onjuno account they'll give you ten dollars if you make a direct deposit into juno on the checking side of your juno account they'll give you a hundred dollars and then what you do is you send that hundred dollars over to the crypto side straight to a layer two of your choice optimism operation polygon ck sync is coming and stark net is also coming you can sign up there's a link in the show notes juno dot finance slash bankless and that's if you set up direct deposit which is super cool that means you receive your paycheck partially in crypto it's pretty awesome so go ahead and check that out david gotta ask you the question before you get into the next episode what is the state of the nation today sir this one's a weird one ryan this week the state of the nation we are inoculating because you know when when bees sting you they sting you with poison but then you become resistant right when you take the poison you actually become more and more resistant to it so nick carter is getting inoculated from the cyber hornets but also going into the bear market we are becoming inoculated from the drugs that is a from a bull market the bull market mania the bear the bull market euphoria so we're going through the bear market it's going to be tough nick's going to kind of lay it out like how tough it's actually going to be but then once we emerge around on the other side of it we shall be inoculated from the bear market that's how these things work how'd you like that one i i like that resistant to um i think some of the i guess falsehoods that are put forward because everything gets tested during a bear market including our conviction and our resolve and we end up on the other side more inoculated stronger and that is the story here so guys we're going to get right to our episode with nick carter but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets

hey bankless nation wanted to introduce our next guest this is nick carter he's the partner of castle island vc host of on the brink podcast repeat bankless guest and also the recent victim of a bitcoin maximist attack on twitter and i think nick we're gonna start right there but uh how you doing man you surviving out there i made it you know i s the cyber hornets they gave me the best they had you know they swarmed i beat them off i jumped into a nearby pond you know i think they lost interest you swatted them away and i read your um post that you wrote earlier this week about kind of like the death of bitcoin maximalism and set some of the context for this but like um david is the one who always calls them cyber hornets david why do you call bitcoin maximalist cyber hornets can you give people context for that term that term just kind of emergently was discovered uh but it definitely is emblematic of uh an organization of people that emergently coordinate without any like there's just this immersion coordination of these type of hornets like they descend upon you uh they there's no like central actor there's no central leader and they all kind of move together uh and when something kicks the hornets nest like the cyber hornets make themselves known and so nick accidentally i guess kicked the cyber hornet's nest uh and fell victim to a cyber hornet attack uh nick you look okay you look pretty good uh can you talk about like what did you do that pissed off through the cyber hornets nest i'm laughing because it's just so stupid it's so stupid yeah i mean most of the people that actually some of the like stalwart like old-time bitcoin hardline is also piled on which is disappointing because like i considered some of them friends and it's like i would go doing their podcast so it's basically putting money in their pocket um you know going to their plans speaking at their events like doing things for them right for five years right since i've been a full-time you know person in this industry and so to see them turn on me over something so just completely stupid is like really disappointing but also it just reveals who has character and who doesn't right and at the same time i've had so many people reach out to me but like thank you for saying that i you know have experienced the same kind of struggles and um i think this is opening a lot more doors and it closes frankly so just to catch everyone up not that i assume everybody's like following like you know the tiny details of my like arguments on twitter uh it started when we announced investment dynamic which is a web 3 um wallet based sign-on authentication startup uh which i actually think is a great awesome use case like i think that's one of the killer apps for web3 um and i was like out and about um i don't know what i was doing but i looked back at the tweet which is just like a normal i think i was buying shoes actually i was buying some pair loafers um blue scarpa it's a really cool miami brand shout out blue scarpa [Laughter] and i came back and there was like a hundred replies on the tweet people like wow don't sampson mao replied he's like you shouldn't be proud of this the the tweet of you announcing that you were participated in this was like a round the castle island investigation yeah people were going crazy it's like well this is like i announce all the deals we do why didn't you have a problem with any of the other 50 deals and so basically a whole bunch of bitcoin is piled on it's like mostly the class of 2021 the newer guys you know maybe they stacked a few shots here and there and like they probably just didn't know a lot about me they probably didn't know anything about castle island and so they'd sort of maybe read some of my stuff they kind of assumed i was a maximalist and then i just wasn't and the whole thing gave them whiplash and then they freaked out and took it as their opportunity just you know try and sort of paint me as like a you know apostate or like a bitcoin defector or like you know like a scam artist or something even though like as you guys know what we do mostly as a fund is we invest in in startup equity so i'm not really showing anything to anyone i'm just announcing that we invested in a startup like dynamic doesn't even have a token right no it's just no token they have like a traditional business model uh they're doing something great doesn't require token obviously uses blockchains it's not built on bitcoin i know it's heretical um but it's really cool it's like it's web 3 like kind of you know private key um user authorization decentralized id similar to like the the jack dorsey project that was um recently announced in some ways completely conceptually i would say very similar i think they're more of did direction we don't really know what what they're doing really um but yeah like the idea is to restore user power over the internet to get rid of the centralized authentication services that you know i think that's a great thing right we probably should definitely move away from the world where apple and google and whatnot uh own your identity right and move to a model where you sort of secure cryptographic information use that to log into things i mean anybody that's ever logged into anything with metamask before knows that this is way way better and uh it creates a more resilient internet uh and just a better experience for everyone funny to me this is not even like um uh this is not even competitive in any way shape or form to bitcoin it's complementary maybe but it's not even the realm of like it's not a separate blockchain it's not a separate asset that you buy yeah it can't be uh in competition with bitcoin like in any way even like just given the nature of the product and what the thing is yeah not not remotely similar from a categorical perspective so um it's really just um actually i would say like the laser eye sort of toxin maxi people have kind of been after me for a while and i think they seized on this they noticed people were angry first of all because just they lost money and then they sort of thought this would be a great issue to like use to try and discredit me and be like nick's not a real bitcoin or something which is fine like if i don't want to be part of whatever they are right these people are like basically lunatics um and i'll be what i am which is not like them i think a decent amount of uh bankless listeners and viewers this is a world that they actually aren't very much exposed to can you put us into the mind of a cyber hornet or a bitcoin maxi like what's their motivation for doing this like why why do they participate in this sort of just like crypto cancel culture around in order to protect bitcoin why do they what are they up to yeah so well a lot of people like to a lot of them see it as their higher purpose right like they believe that they're actually defenders of the protocol or something a lot of these ideas are holdovers from maybe like the uasf wars back in 2017 where we had the big block wars and saw small block faction one and uh that's at least the you know being charitable here that there's a segment of the cyber hornets that are these guys that have been around for a few years um and they you know think their bitcoins immune system they're protecting bitcoin to be clear i'm not trying to change bitcoin in any way i love bitcoin bitcoin's great um so whatever the immune system is doing it's misfiring right um so there's one cohort that does that they think oh we can't uh consider contemplate any changes or revisions to bitcoin or any departure from sort of the ordained path and that's sort of like a bad thing i would say because it leads to total intellectual stagnation and you know it means that actually altering bitcoin in any way is virtually impossible i think it's too difficult it's probably a balance but i think it's too difficult then there's sort of like the whole like the people like the cyber hornet like the toximaxis whatever a lot of these people are really new they're new to the industry they came in in 2020 2021 um they're not like ogs with tons and tons of bitcoin a lot of these people are pretty brand new so maybe they kind of knew i was alert a little bit but i'm actually not shocked that they didn't know about castle island they didn't know about my views they didn't know anything about me because they're newcomers right uh and they like to just like post memes and like they like to be part of this bitcoin culture which goes beyond just um the asset itself right it's about asitism it's about like uh deprivation privation right it's about um stacking bitcoin at the exclusion of other kind of earthly pleasures it's certainly about uh considering bitcoin the only moral asset to hold to the exclusion of everything else is certainly other l ones other blockchain tokens and this ideology which is quasi-religious actually if you really look into it uh it's got an i don't know how to pronounce this eschatology there's an eschatological component which is s whatever i don't know how to pronounce that i've only ever read the word okay give me a break so there's a component which is like basically has to do with the like final judgment like looking forward into the future it's the view that everything else in cryptos like sodom gomorrah and it's like sinful and there'll come a day where the hellfire rains down and all of the other liquidity everything good and you know sort of like worth saving out there and like uh the sinful sodom and gomorrah land is gonna sort of like collapse back to bitcoin like just you wait one day it'll all come back to bitcoin like we'll build it all on liquid and that is what allows them to tolerate the reality the ugly reality which they can't tolerate which is there's a lot of innovation like actual real economic genuine important stuff happening elsewhere in fact the vast vast vast vast vast majority of all economic activity in crypto does not happen on bitcoin as we all know and so they need to observe this reality they can't help but observe it and they need to justify it somehow and so for them they rely on this like judgment day ideology where uh eventually you know some catalyst out of whether it's gary gensler like destroying ethereum or uh you know something else means that everything will come back to bitcoin all the innovation was built on bitcoin and that's just you know like a completely delusional thing right um but that's part of the ideology and then of course there's the idea that you know the asset issuance has to be completely perfect uh completely free of original sin right so like i'm using religious words but that's because this is a secular religion right it is a secular religion um if the issuance isn't perfect with the proof of work uh and look you can hold me responsible for uh expressing some of these ideas historically i have if the issuance wasn't absolutely perfect with you know the founder yeah you know being satoshi being this like on humanly inhumanly altruistic entity superhuman promethean entity if it wasn't perfect with the proof of work and with the miners not having advantage and like no ico no primo whatever then the uh the whole coin is tainted forever thanks to the original sin there's no absolution possibility there's no ability to you know get past the sin and to be you know rechristened brought back into the light that's not possible and so bitcoin is also hoped that a theorem is inherently sinful because of the the launch structure and so that's the ideology uh beyond that there's like a cultural fact where people sink their whole lives into this thing look i'm the last person to uh really be have a moral high ground there because i'm sort of all in but you know they do the sake dylan ears and they do like the safety and like the book readings and like the it it becomes an obsession becomes all-consuming it becomes much more than a financial position and so um they can't toler you know they can't handle um like the selling off because that like they can't handle these models being invalidated right they can't handle the stock to flow model being like discredited so because they're all in it's so much more painful when it sells off which it has done recently because it's not just they lost money but their credibility is selling off too right and their self-worth and so that's sort of like what it's like to be a cyber hornet it's not a pleasant existence it's a sad existence you're just buzzing around and you're going finding victims to sting all the time um but let me ask you so you mentioned a cohort from like you know 2020 2021 2022 but there are actually some kind of like more oh geez bitcoin hardliners that are part of this cyber hornet attack too um is that the case as well that there are like bitcoiners that have been maximalists for years and years that kind of are the de facto leaders of these hornets what can you say about the people that have been in crypto and in in bitcoin for for a while or are there some of those that you found as part of the group attacking yeah of course so look i mean a lot of friends people are considered friends just completely turned on me um that's fine that's their prerogative they can do whatever we want it's actually really funny within like the the pleb space like there are a lot of people where i've gone out of my way to like help get these people into the industry they called dm me you know i would do a call with these people give them advice and then i turn around you know a couple years go by and then like you see them calling me like a scammer and stuff it's like you like should we like you remember what i'd what you dm to me like years ago why did they do that do you think this is like just a human group kind of mentality where the the hardliners have to be in a position where they kind of attack the the more moderate factions in order to i don't know achieve some sort of social end or you know as as a political group radicalizes it always purges the moderates and uh you know no one can break ranks unison yeah correct you can't show weakness you always punish the um people engaging in apostasy the hardest like the outsiders you just hate them because they're the outsiders but man the insiders that waiver oh you know they really suck right because you can't tolerate any defection because like that could trigger more defections um so the the like long time bitcoiners that like turned on me that i you know considered friends or whatever i think that's actually just very cynical and opportunistic they know what my fun does they know me right like i don't just invest in bitcoin if you're like if you've been around for the last five years of my career i haven't been quiet about it um you know what i do and uh so why did they why are they like leading the hordes here it's very simple they think bitcoin um is content like a lot of them are content creators right they're like quote unquote educators they think it's a zero-sum game and if one educator is rising another must be falling and i do the education and stuff on the side it's not my job i don't really make any money from it right my job is my job right um they want to secure more like space they want to secure more market share more attention and so of course the great opportunity like wow we can discredit this guy we can like paint him as a coiner and then no bitcoin is ever going to listen to him whatever like the unfortunate thing for them is that you know distancing myself from the toximaxies is what is the best thing i've ever done actually and it's making me much more credible and um and and it's opening a lot of doors actually and it's my star will continue to rise here that's the problem for them so by attempting to like come together like their camp is getting smaller and less relevant and you know having defections like me from that camp is really really going to hurt them right because like there's not that many people that are sort of like thoughtful and and like more balanced about this within the bitcoin camp there's very few remaining right like hassu left eric wall left um you know like like thoughtful uh udi obviously high profile defector like the more of these that hap myself now there's not that many people that i consider like super like actually thoughtful sensible understands finance deeply realistic is interested in real objective reality as opposed to just delusional myths like i still have a few friends like that um but it's more like the fingers of one hand so the more defections there are the the more radical and niche and basically irrelevant the like hardliner crew becomes you know this whole like culture of like bitcoin maximalism reminds me of this old like um joke from like world war ii i'm gonna like butcher it so i'm gonna like speedrun it but it's uh like uh like there's a so somebody dies in world war ii and for some reason they get sent to hell and there's three like pits of just like pitch and like the devil showing this guy around and like well here's the here's the american here's where we put the pit that we put the americans and like there's a bunch of americans in this very hot like pitch uh and like there's devils like mini devils like pushing pitchforking the americans back into the pitch uh and then he shows them to the second pitch uh and then it's the british and it's even hotter for some reason whoever wrote this this pit this story this joke says the the the british pitch is even hotter and there's even more devils pushing people back in and then they turn to the russian pitch they're where all the russian like communists are and it's the hottest one alive and but there aren't any like devils on the edge of this one pushing people back in so whenever and whenever any one russian tries to escape the the pitch of of communist hell the other russians just pull them back in right it's like no no you can't leave and it's just very as much reminiscent on looks like bitcoin maximalist don't break the ranks because if you do we will pull you back in and you will never leave and and like something that fascinates me about the world of crypto is like the thing that i get compelled to the most is like this relationship between code and culture as in the code of something works its way up and starts to define the culture that's on top of it and like the ethereum critique of like bitcoin itself is that so much of it is in a story form so much of it is in like meme form where like you have to believe the story of bitcoin to really see its purpose in the world and as a result of that i think that kind of incentivizes this like maximalist culture who like not only do they believe the story but they're enforcing the story and they're enforcing the story by like if you break ranks we will shun you you are either 100 a bitcoin maximalist or you're not a bitcoiner at all does this kind of like like story resonate with you nick yeah you're spot on uh it's crabs in a bucket um the problem is that the like testable claims that these people rely on are like they're basically false or they're invalidated or they're trending towards some validation now look i'm not going to sit here and be like super negative on bitcoin i am still positive on it i think it's great i'm not approaching it from the framework of the maximalists right you don't have to most people worldwide don't right um i'm extricating myself from that but yeah if the sort of like core um like more testable empirical beliefs about bitcoin that they relied on are there it's just like a graveyard of falsehoods so look at the stock to flow model they all believed it now they're gonna now that it's basically like really hard to believe i mean it's not like it you can't invalidate it or not it's just like dots moving around on like a you know like chart so it's the the creator of the model never allowed it to be invalidated so it's just whatever it's a bad model but so that model is like basically clearly off base now virtually every single hardcore like bitcoin maximalist every bitcoin educator they believed this thing there was virtually no one that didn't the people that spoke out about it were like the more moderates like me or paul stortz um like people with sort of more economics training um you know you're not going to find a lot of the like people that you think of as like the key hardliner bitcoiners that were speaking out against this model they're all like oh well what if it's true and it was like a very seductive thing that pulled in a lot of people into bitcoin those people are very angry now by the way if you want to you want an explanation for why people are so mad it's because they really believed in this thing um so that thing is false like the havings is obviously related basically every single hardcore like bitcoiner believed in the having thing which is like one of the stupidest things imaginable man like you're going from 1.8 inflation issuance to 0.9 percent that's a tiny supply side modulation um demand is what matters here guys demand not supply the supply dynamics are known right it's like it's not even econ 101 it's just like rationality and like logic 101. um so that you know the having is basically invalidated um i would say what else the um the theory that everything would just be built on bitcoin that the side chains theory obviously just like not happening right um stable coins were on bitcoin then they left nfts were on bitcoin then they left right so any theory of utility along those lines didn't work the theory that like a theorem would collapse under its weight it's just like that thing has momentum like it's just a denial of reality to think the thing's just gonna you know not exist anymore um so like the idea that everything interesting all the altcoin tech is gonna be built on bitcoin none of that happened right it wouldn't make sense like bitcoin is a specific thing you don't want it to like you know you don't want to do all the altcoins on bitcoin why would you um so like all these beliefs are just trending in the wrong direction what's interesting here nick is you mentioned sort of the the extremists push out the the moderates right i actually consider myself a moderate bitcoiner right like i i hold bitcoin i'm i'm inherently bullish on bitcoin's future but i have um felt very much like not recently but um in years past kind of pushed out by that community of of hardliners right so much so that um it feels weird to call myself a bitcoiner even though what is a bitcoin or someone who owns bitcoin someone who believes in the potential this decentralized technology but there was a time nick where i would talk to you bitcoiners more hardline people bitcoin maximalists i i even remember conversations with hasu you know back in like 2018 or 2019 or so where um the point would be made that hey this intolerant minority is actually good for an asset like bitcoin and other communities should actually strive to recruit this intolerant minority of hardliners and part of the reason i may be bearish on a community like ethereum is because there are there isn't this intolerant minority of hardline ethereum people who are very excited about the number go up of of ether the asset and all of these other things and particularly in like 2019 ethereum had none of that it didn't even have anything is this reminiscent of a hardline community he even thought the asset was valuable um so what do you say about this do you think this intolerant minority is kind of a an asset to bitcoin in some ways or are you increasingly viewing it as a liability for the community i would say it's actually like the structure but like people kind of give too much credit to the people on twitter during like the four cores and too little credit to just like the nature of bitcoin um [Music] you know like uh i would say bitcoin itself just by virtue of the soft fork model is hard to change and uh that probably did a lot more to protect it than like people wearing user activated soft fork hats or you know um no 2x hats or anything like that bitcoin just has a lot of inertia just by virtue of the way it is and the way it's set up and the fact you just sort of opt into new upgrades um so like something like the laser eyes is that is this helpful to bitcoin or not irrelevant i would say irrelevant um the people that like fought the the last war five years ago you know which was sort of like the really big battle those people are like barely even active right they're not like still holding the line so i didn't tolerate minority like i wouldn't even say it exists today um you have a different set of people for the most part it's pretty different which sort of like is doing a cargo cult of that right instead of looking at bitcoin's underlying principles and the values that the protocol enshrines and trying to uphold those principles they're just sort of like doing the very surface level thing which is yelling at people on the internet but like they don't have any like real appreciation for the like actual underlying values here it's more like oh yeah we can uh you know get a dopamine rush by attacking people online because that's what our predecessors did you know in in the wars of yore uh so they're just like cargo culting like previous battles um which i guess it's there's like not like big wars to be fought every day so they're bored and it's like civil war reenactments basically it's not the real thing you know there's no like uh bullets in the muskets um so yeah um if you want to like really defend bitcoin then i think you have to start from like the actual true like principles uh and and and you know work upwards from there and i would say with the with the theorem like you guys do have um you know uh ideas and underlying uh you know components that you want to uphold and you want to prioritize um so i'd say like that definitely exists you know like the idea of making ether valuable in its own right that was then like expressed into a bunch of design decisions and things like that um you know even the striking the balance between sort of like the aggressive pace of innovation versus the required uh slowness in terms of uh making sure you're not breaking anything the theorem has a different cadence compared to like some of its more aggressive competitors right um you know so like it's definitely got its own set of um like core values i would say um now whether it's sort of occupying the right location on the continuum i couldn't tell you um i'm still like i still favor a very slow deliberate approach um but uh yeah i don't think you know the like intolerant minority is doing much of anything on bitcoin these days during this middle of this uh cyber hornet attack i noticed you had uh the dot ethan your name then carter.if do you do you own nickcarter.ethe no please do not send funds to that i was just trolling people i thought it was funny you're like okay it's like oh you're being attacked it's like whatever i like i can still laugh about it and still make fun of these people i'm pissed i piss them off more whatever i don't care like i don't i don't need these people for anything right i'm they're not coming to me for investment these are not the founders that i invest in these are certainly not the people that invest in my fund i'll tell you that i keep waiting for bitcoin maximalism to die though is it going to die is it this could be it i'm not going to it could be it i'm not going to you know be like so presumptuous is to think that i killed it but man this has got to  hurt you know there's not that many defectors left yeah to be clear i was never a maximalist though i never self-identified that way right but people across like the ethereum ecosystem like uh there's like a number of group chats that i in the ethereum ecosystem i was like oh wow go look at nick carter getting attacked by the bitcoin maxis like they're eating their own at the moment but like i don't really think uh like you're you're not a bitcoin maximalist you are nick carter right you're a free thinker and i think like and we we've seen like hazu uh also a free thinker more or less kind of just like leave the space entirely a few years ago uh and like it's really left and i don't know if he ever really got in a fight with them or not but like the the what i've noticed is that there's this kind of like brain drain out of like the bitcoin space because if you don't fit the mold if you don't fit the the chant of the cyber hornets then like where do you fit right and it takes a a decent amount of just a lack of critical thinking to be able to do that comfortably right like no one no one who likes to who's intrinsically curious perpetually curious wants to explore things uh will find themselves like satisfied just like chanting the chant of like bitcoin maxless it's like to me like you were like one of the last people that did no yeah no you're right i mean i i was one of the last rats off the sinking ship is the way i think that was like half drowned you know right when they found me and like the last independent thinker who like produces really informative really in that very well researched content that people in the ecosystem associate loosely with bitcoin or maybe more than loosely maybe maybe more tightly with bitcoin oh i think a lot of people probably thought nick that you were a bitcoin maximalist right yeah yeah that was the problem i probably should have done more to defray that like um i guess i wasn't clear enough maybe but yeah i certainly am not i maybe we should define the term i you know i see it as someone that that thinks so there's like the narrow and the broad form one is like touching or investing or using any other blockchain isn't is just sinful maybe that's the broad form and then sort of like maybe the other one is like someone who only holds bitcoin um that's you know maybe that's the narrow form um like i pretty much mostly hold bitcoin in my personal portfolio um my main like exposure to things is through my funds though right obviously that gives me the most leverage and the funds invest in all kinds of stuff mostly startups and all over the all over the industry i mean like dozens of blockchains my startup coin metrics they run nodes like everywhere every node they run all the nodes that was i did that before anybody knew who i was so coin metrics and analytics um basically an analytics company that investigates all of the blockchain every blockchain yeah i remember you guys were like doing in-depth stuff with eos back in like 2017. yeah it was so annoying to run a neon man but like like that thing began in 2016 i was in business school i wanted to compare like bitcoin to ethereum basically and there was nowhere to do it so from the beginning from the beginning i've been curious about other blockchains right because i just want to know where is the economic activity happening where's the vibrancy so that's i'm a data driven person i love data right so like the fact that people thought it was some like extreme hardliner it's like i was running these nodes you know like cm is like one of the only entities in the world that runs full archival nodes for all these blockchains some of these blockchains uh i won't name names they're on live support because there's like three analytics firms that run the nodes you know so it's just crazy that people thought otherwise i don't know i maybe i should have been more clear well i think this is a fantastic lesson in just kind of what makes the crypto world tick a little bit like every single blockchain has a little bit of this right like a little bit of tribalism a little bit of identity even down to the tokens it just so happens that bitcoiner's got like a lot of it and it's kind of like starting to drown out everything that's not about bitcoin um and so just like the lesson here is that like this is a little bit true in all communities no matter what uh so nick i'm sorry that uh this this community came and descended upon you but like knowing you uh that it's not really gonna it's just gonna be sweat off your back at the end of the day well first of all i found out who my friends were which is very useful right so i know who's a snake basically and who's willing to throw their friend under the bus because for a little dopamine rush second of all like a lot more people respect me now people that i respect respect me now for saying this third of all i think bitcoin maximalism is a genuinely like toxic cancerous thing that harms bitcoin and to the extent i can harm that i'm very happy to do my part and i owe the world a debt right because i uh was uh i wasn't ever maximalist but i was like definitely aggressive at times in defending bitcoin and uh maybe that encouraged these people i don't know uh like the ultimately is their financial assets and yes there's an underlying philosophy beneath bitcoin and i've like done my best to describe it and so on um but you know there's more to life than bitcoin if someone has a more nuanced or mixed view or heterodox view that they're not a bad person right they just have different views and the the intellectual like i've had core devs reach out to me and thank me for writing this right there's like an intellectually stilted environment holds everything back people are afraid to discuss any idea i mean just look at the discussions of um you know peter todd brought up the other day adding inflation into bitcoin i don't think that's a good idea but that discussion was so incredibly heated people couldn't handle that um you're right bitcoin isn't the place people go for intellectually stimulating discussions that's a shame i want to reopen that well there's also this conversation going around like hazu was definitely part of this conversation many in the ethereum camp are of like bitcoin's long-term sustainability and like there's a number of different ways to fix bitcoin's long-term sustainability but they all start at the path of admitting that this is a problem and i think that's what a lot of uh you know cyber hornets will refuse to admit right like the the the issuance of bitcoin runs out to zero we don't really think that the transaction fees uh can sustain that you put out a tweet like uh about ten days ago like seven days ago and you said since it's a bear market maybe i won't be yelled at uh maybe that part was wrong now you know why they wanted to cancel my ass right right and you go um something this again is is in response to the long-term plan of securing the bitcoin blockchain some options do nothing two that's that's option one two bust the 21 million hard cap and create a perpetual subsidy extremely contentious with like core thought of around bitcoin uh recycle ancient coins saying 10 years into minor subsidy i think implying that like any uh bitcoin that hasn't been moved on the bitcoin blockchain in 10 years starts to become like uh part of the issuance or the subsidy for for block rewards uh and then the last option creating a fee target by growing and contracting the block size the point is it's like there's a number of different different ways to like think about bitcoin long-term sustainability and if bitcoin wants to get there it has to start having these conversations nick are you like optimistic that these conversations might actually start now that we're starting to see some like general defection from the bitcoin hivemind i think there could be a sea change here yeah i am um we could do a whole episode on that tweet probably uh but yeah i i a lot of people reach out to me and we're like yeah i think something's changing around these parts um because like the the people holding the line here they haven't really said anything new in in years and years and years and then the newcomers that are like the foot soldiers they they don't have ideas they're just regurgitating things from like the sort of half dozen thought leaders um so yeah like let's bring back some dynamism to the conversation i think it'll happen well that is and going to be an interesting thing to look forward to in this bear market and there's perhaps perhaps that we have a long bear market ahead of us to figure out some of these very hard questions and then we also have some questions around around this bear market that we want to ask unique such as just like lessons that you learned in this 2021 bull market and like also questions about the shattered state of the crypto market today uh and like overall your thoughts on macro and regulatory so we're gonna get to all these questions and more right after we get back from some of these fantastic sponsors that make

with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16eth to get started you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled eid that uses your note to stake you also get rpl

yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there all right guys we are back with nick carter the um recent lever of the bitcoin maximalist religion maybe we'll say that um but nick you've got a lot of perspective on bear and bull markets and macro and crypto banks and everything and in in the second part of this we just want to get your take on some of these things but but first let me just kind of check in with you like so we're in a bear market i think that is uh blatantly obvious confirmed and bitcoin's off 70 i mean ether is getting close to 80 if not surpassing 80 down to like triple digits um hard to believe how are you feeling about things like what's what's what's your vibe right now in this uh in this bear market well i'm in a relatively lucky position because you know our timing was really good with our third fundraise and most of the capital that i will have deployed to date across the three funds is it lays ahead of me right so um if you just weighed it that way the economic opportunity looks amazing right now i mean so you raised during the bull market and deployed the end of the bull market yeah that's always the goal that was what we did with our first fund as well and it was it worked perfectly you can't really plan for these things but yeah your entry price matters your vintage matters a lot and um you know maybe things could grind down for another three years who knows but i feel really really great about valuations like and this is all like selfish this isn't necessarily stuff that generalizes but you know in terms of the pendulum the dynamics between founders and and investors things are definitely swinging back in favor of investors which is refreshing um so i feel good uh obviously it's gonna be a long road like um you know we're in this for for the long game so companies who invest in today might those investments might be realized in eight to ten years um but yeah i think the macros is troubling like we're definitely headed for recession the fed i believe acted far too aggressively in a panicked way too late they eased for too long and they waited to tighten until it was too late there's basically no precedent for tightening into a recession um so like we'll see if they really stay committed to that um but yeah i mean it's a very very like people talk about the macro the macro is very very very challenging um you know it's hard to ignore it affects everything the best chart i found explaining actually bitcoin price action is just the change year-over-year in global m2 money supply so that's just a proxy for the amount of liquidity sloshing around that basically varies really closely with the price of bitcoin so obviously money supply is shrinking right now basically right you know you you uh you tighten uh you raise interest rates uh that basically shrinks the amount of liquidity floating around uh so until that reverses i'd you know have a hard time seeing things get better the other thing i'll say is like i'm seeing a lot of vcs like generalist vcs be like yeah if this is anything like 2008 then you know you're gonna have to do this and that it's like well you know the world's been around for much longer than uh you know 20 years and um this isn't necessarily 2008 2008 things were covered really quickly because we got qe right things rocketed off the bottom uh so it was like actually people say the great recession for financial assets it was like nothing housing prices like fell a little bit and then recovered stocks rocketed off the bottom um what about 1929 you know what about uh the 30s with hyperinflation what about post-war monetary repression what about the 70s with stagflation there's a lot of other things you could look at as your historical analogs just because we haven't ourselves lived through them doesn't mean we're not going to and if you look at the level of debt in the system sovereign debt um just the amount of leverage that's been built up uh like we there's going to be a dramatic and difficult time ahead of us we are going to have to deal with monetary repression here which is uh high inflation low interest rates um and yeah it looks like we're in for stagflation uh fed doesn't have any really firepower here right you know rates are are still pretty low um so you know like i would encourage people to look beyond just like the most recent data point 2008 i would actually look further back in history for per parallels so um nick what's your take on this because people in crypto really haven't seen like crypto as an asset class hasn't seen a macro climate like this at all right i mean crypto wasn't even around 2008 when that um you know financial bomb went off um so what what do you expect here what do you think could happen right so crypto people are very much used to like these four year cycles so i i um tweeted out i think yesterday i was like hey uh how long will the bear market last i did like just a very informal twitter survey of like one year two years three to four years or five plus years eight percent of people thought it was one or two years so like everyone is still in this oh and crypto of course it recovers that it crashes every every you know two three years and then it comes back every every two three years expect to be served a bull market on a golden platter in two years exactly do you think that's the case or do you think that this time things could be different given the macro and like if if the macro is more at play here how long do you think this could take to heal i don't think that there's any guarantee that some of these assets would ever recover their prior highs i mean it's the same case last time right you know you have churn right so yeah maybe the index does recover its prior high but some assets just go to zero so there's always churn so it's not necessarily the case if you hold like feather coin and purecoin and you know 20 they hit their peaks and whenever it was you're not making them like they're not hitting their peak again in 2020 or 2021. um so you have to be mindful of that so you have to be dynamic i don't think there's any mathematical requirement that you know it's like a two three or four year cycle and i think the four-year cycle thing is illusory and that's built on sort of two or three data points uh we've also been uh you know against the backdrop of almost endless qe and really loose liquidity the loosest conditions in living memory over the last 10 years um that's changing right there's like a fundamental policy change uh we're moving into we're we're looking at generational lows and sort of commodities to financial assets ratio it looks like commodities can be much more important than financial assets going forward crypto is in the category of financial assets right so it could just be that there's sort of like structurally less interest in the asset class on a go forward basis like what really matters in the world today like we live very insulated lives what really matters is like can we pull oil and gas out of the ground efficiently and create fertilizer and grow food and keep the lights on there's going to be like large portions of the globe where the answer that is no so sort of you know i would expect more of society's resources to go in that direction it's like keeping people alive and keeping the lights on you know things like that you know pulling a nickel and tin out of the ground and building batteries for sort of the renewable transition stuff like that not to be too depressing guys well i was gonna say but like so all of that's true and yet at the same time we have very challenging macro conditions where the fed probably has to raise rates i don't know four or five percent who knows gotta curtail inflation you know some way but um the the us is in such a worse place i mean you talk about the 1970s our debt to gdp is much worse than the 1970s it's greater than even the post uh world war ii years so we've got that as a challenging backdrop but like isn't that the promise of crypto i mean you know in the in these events where we have the the fiat monetary supply completely debasing which is what you have to expect regardless of any other you know condition over the next 10 years is is more fiat debasement is that where crypto's supposed to shine is there some silver lining there nick yeah it's i have contradictory ideas in my head um you know i wish i could go back to being a taxi maxi where like everything's very simple you know that's to pile on i think i've trashed them enough um but yeah on the one hand you know the more the major fiats to base themselves i think that's good for your um your you know your crypto assets although not ex like not every cryptocurrency is competing with fiat currency right like so like let's just say from a big i would say ethereum is really more a function of like the things that are built on top of ethereum and it's it's got its own like kind of pretty obviously it does have a beta to you know like liquidity and things like that but it's also more like can you do a lot of transactions and burn a lot of ether and you know things like that um bitcoin i would say you know i would expect it to do well as you have sovereign currencies start to inflate and in the 30s after world war one and an attempted return and a failed return to the gold standard the 20s and 30s you had hyperinflation in the developed world right germany was the most developed industrial nation in the world so when you have a massive overhang from like having fought a war or something like that you get inflation in the 40s 50s of the world had fought another war you got significant inflation like just in the u.s case study where they had to reset the 40s is the situation i would say it's really analogous in the us significant inflation to reset the debt um and need hyperinflation in certain european countries so are conditions primed such that sovereign currencies are going to be really debased aggressively in the next decade 100 yes i think so um doesn't mean it could be an extremely bumpy road also yes it is bumpy um are we kind of relying on the fed to basically pivot and stop hiking um also yes right i think they're gonna quell inflation for now we're actually looking things rolling over if you look at basically any indicator you want inflation is coming down sort of for now is inflation solved i don't think so what are the key drivers of inflation energy is becoming harder to pull out of the ground we don't have as much of it we haven't invested in it energy is everything basically um no one trusts each other globally anymore there's a war on but also like tensions are rising with china we're like have less globalization that's going to make things more expensive too are those two and then we're also trying to do this green transition which is very very expensive we'll see if we're able to do that um you know are those factors solved by the fed hiking rates certainly not so there's like kind of fundamental inflationary factors i think here so yeah i do think that you're like independent or like algorithmic or like code based monetary systems do look better by contrast nick um i know you've been a fan and probably still are of the uh concept of like free banking right um particularly around like um bitcoin banks uh and like more recently as part of this this cycle uh maybe um exclusive we haven't seen this in previous cycles we've actually had some crypto banks being brought low and being brought down so celsius of course um looks completely insolvent uh not even sure if hopefully hopefully depositors are able to get some some funds out of this at some point but things are not looking good at this point block fi uh as well not completely insolvent but in uh has some similarities of course they're still allowing withdrawals and and that sort of thing but they've definitely had a tough time of it through this bear market as a result of you know lens going bad to the three hours capitals of the world what do you think about this concept of free banking has it really like taken a hit or do you think this is a you know healthy cleansing process like what should happen in in the free market when uh banks make bad decisions is they should go out of business and you know equity holders should be wiped out what's your take now yeah it's kind of one of those things that did take me by surprise was the level of i guess you kind of expect interrelatedness you do expect contagions um especially when they're all lending to the same borrowers um i i didn't expect the three arrows thing to occur i mean i didn't really have knowledge of their operation um but it was shocking and yeah i've been disappointed i mean if you look at the historical free banking eras in places like scotland or canada or switzerland or sweden those are sort of the major case studies i think we had one in the us but it wasn't true for banking those were very stable systems they didn't they weren't characterized by panics and they didn't have lenders of last resort um it's just that uh the expansion of credit was limited by uh the nature of the system by the kind of structure and the incentives were in place in our case in sort of like the crypto free banking era of 2017 to now credit was wildly over expanded um ended up you know investments were made in these like ponzi like things which collapsed and the consequence of this was just like massive holes in everyone's balance sheet and insolvencies and liquidity crises runs on the bank and when all is said and done i mean i don't think we've seen the extent of this thing so far i'm just finding out about new lenders that i'd never heard of that are like magically insolvent so it's like god i wish i hadn't heard about you for the first time knowing that now there's like some sort of like liquidity crisis um but yeah i i think when it's all said and done there's gonna be massive consolidation there's gonna be a small handful of these lenders um you know maybe fewer than half a dozen they might all be the major exchanges basically are you still like a believer in the concept or do you think the concept has taken a hit or what sort of reforms would you like to see in kind of like crypto banking free banking to make it um a bit more you know sustainable um i think you know part of what caught me by surprise is not only like the everyone lending to like the three hours capital of the world and and how bad of shape they they were actually in it turned out but i also had um partially in the crypto banking side especially thinking the block flies of the world a false sense of security maybe because these loans are collateralized loans so what could possibly go wrong but like they were collateralized by assets that were trading off peg and gdbc and you know you kind of see in the details that that things were um not as clean as they seem they seem but the concept of free banking are you still a believer or what kind of reforms should we be making oh i mean like the yeah completely i do believe in it i don't think this episode in crypto discredits the sort of overall idea which is just that you can have a functional banking system without a central bank right that's the idea and without real oversight from the state um what reforms would i like to see i mean i i so a lot of people use this as an opportunity to be like oh d5 is better but they're kind of doing a different thing you know like this these are like more wrapped in a legal uh structure um and some of them were fully collateralized some under collateralized um but there's like a sort of default process and like it's wrapped in orderly legal wrapper whereas like the you know obvios and compounds of the world that's it's kind of like a different thing it's you know you're borrowing against like highly liquid assets um so i wouldn't i mean i do think that d5 looks well looks like it's done well comparatively speaking what i would be interested to see would be more of more transparency and it's kind of funny because you know i have a little debate in my head which is do you actually want that much transparency when it comes to banking so let's say you're going to go put some money in the bank right they don't hold on to the money they go and deploy it into a bunch of small business loans or mortgages or whatever and so let's say what you were able to do would be to look at the mortgage portfolio which you can't right you can't go to your bank and be like where are you putting the money um but let's say you were able to you were able to go and get an itemized look at their mortgage portfolio you'd probably be horrified you'd be like oh so you're lending you know to like a stripper and like an only fans model and like you're lending to like such and such it's like never mind somebody is crypto my god yeah yeah exactly so um you know you actually kind of want there to be some opacity i would say to build credibility there's like an interesting blog post about this um and which i kind of believe but at the same time for the sake of repairing people's confidence here i like the model of um some of these undercollateralized d5 lenders that do have a kind of institutionalization built in and where you can see who the counterparties are so you put some funds in a pool and then there's like a delegate or some entity that administers it they do real underwriting they lend and then you know it is actually transparent where the funds are going that's not foolproof it doesn't mean there's never going to be defaults but at least sort of then you have a better idea of the portfolio and maybe you're going to sort of assess it better so i i think that would be like an interesting and because you know the problem is you have certain big counterparties that borrow from everyone and maybe they're pledging collateral many times over right you know maybe the the lenders aren't talking to each other right so there's i think there's some common sense reforms you can see there i worry that you know the regulator is just going to come in and like nuke the whole space well what do you think about this so um there's a recent interview you did in forum forbes and they quoted you as um nick carter expects regulatory response to recent carnage to be harsh aggressive and warranted maybe at the time you were talking about like um tara ust or something like that and it's a different context but um what do you think about this harsh aggressive and it may be warranted do you think that we've been talking a lot about sins and sinners in this in this episode do you think that you know regulators should make the crypto industry pay for their sins oh we're sinners yeah for sure that's the thing whenever there's like a financial crisis um you get regulation i'd like clockwork basically because that's when there's the popular support for regulation before when everyone was making money we didn't want regulation now that everybody's lost money it's like oh yeah maybe this regulation thing makes sense so i think if you asked a bunch of crypto people they'd probably be like yeah kind of sympathetic here um let's uh let's impose some common sense regulation so yeah i do think that that we'll get something in the us here um so nick i know uh we're at about time but you know we want to finish with maybe something that's um a bit more optimistic because um you've just you decided to stay in crypto during the last you know bear cycle uh and um i'm assuming you're deciding to stay in crypto for this bear cycle as well uh there must be a reason for this all right like why should people stay in crypto why are you staying in crypto what should we expect on the other side of this bear market what makes you optimistic well it's the most exciting market in the world i mean it moves the fastest it's the most active you know information gets priced in it's 24 7. like how could the i don't know man this is just like so turbocharged it's fun um even when it's like feels like you're you know being hit with an artillery strike or something like all your like friends and businesses are just like blowing up and you know things like that um yeah obviously i believe in what's going on i mean like look bitcoin is worth 120 of the value of gold i think that's i think its terminal value is obviously way higher than that uh stable coins i think we're gonna see crypto dollarization i think that's gonna be good right i think we're gonna see a ton of these sovereign currencies i think these in emerging markets i think you're gonna see a ton of these currencies wiped out and uh i'm not like a dollar enthusiast but the dollar is just to basically destroy these things on crypto rails and that's going to be good because it means that regular savers can adopt this they can adopt the currency of their choice and protect themselves so i think the effect is that the fact that crypto infrastructure exists is going to bring about the failure of these sovereign currencies faster than it would have otherwise occurred so it's going to be like hyper capitalism you know things just happen faster everything's happening faster now i think defy is a powerful and important thing i think there's been a structural failure in this country to create credit credits become very politicized uh and and so have financial rails generally but especially credit after dodd-frank um you know small banks got crushed um as interest rates fell as well um as it became much harder to be a financial institution small banks lend to small businesses there's just a structural positive credit now and it's a very political thing who gets access to credit now it's sort of like who has access to these like government stimulus programs basically i think that's a terrible situation that's not a market-based situation i'd love to see d5 fill that gap and uh and you know actually you know make credit equitable and abundant once again um so yeah i think there's a huge amount of positive stuff here a lot of d5 i've been very critical of d5 i mean i've written a few things i think there's a lot of bad ideas that need to be eliminated the circularity certainly the ponzi structures that seem to appear everywhere and i think they will because his financial conditions are tight and and maybe ponzi's aren't going to work in our sort of brave new world here but yeah i mean i still think fundamentally what we're building is an incredibly important thing uh nothing about that's changed and uh there's gonna be a lot of chaos out there in in the real world uh and it's important that we build structures that actually work and and work for people and are neutral and and are predictable and do what they say they do well i'm sure you would agree nick the best time to be in the space and to do those things is during the bear
