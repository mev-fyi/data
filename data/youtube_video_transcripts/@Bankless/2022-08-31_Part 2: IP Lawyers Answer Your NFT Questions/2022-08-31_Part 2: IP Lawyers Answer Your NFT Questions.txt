[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs this is part two of the ip panel that began a couple weeks back we have brought the dream team back here to help us unpack some more problems in the nft space regarding ip and the law and also to talk about some of the solutions that might exist for those problems so joining us today we have some of the folks you'll you'll recognize from last time max kernan the ceo of remaster alex modell ceo of remaster also a trained lawyer himself we have jeremy goldman who is an ip lawyer who focuses on copyright and technology at frankfurt current klein and cells who really has carved out a practice for himself that is basically entirely supporting web3 projects at this time so again he works with some familiar names to all of you so he recuses himself from time to time when talking about these issues in specifics we have daniel barsky who is an ip and technology lawyer with holland and knight and he co-directs the startup clinic at the university of miami and finally we have sarah odenkirk with us this time got had some cross wires last time she wasn't able to make it but she is the partner and co-chair of art law and the nft practice group at cohen debates abrahams and shepherd quite the mouthful of an introduction but i'm so glad to have you all here great to be here great to be back excited for the sequel it's going to be better than the than the original yeah running it back and running or relate the weapon potentially the empire to the star two okay that's what we're going for unfortunately we have a great lead in sarah so we do yeah we have sarah this time so we we we must be better um okay a couple things but we're gonna dive into here but a couple caveats before we start so first this is not legal advice we of course always say not financial advice in this podcast in this case it is not legal advice we are joined by four lawyers i guess on this call but uh but please don't go and take action on your project based on specific advice given here um also if you have not checked out the first part of this series please go do that first it sets the the base and the foundation for a lot of what we're going to talk about now it's an awesome episode i virtually never listen to my past podcast episodes because it just makes me anxious but i did go back and listen to this one uh in preparation for the second conversation and i was like damn this is good it's a good episode so all credit to y'all who really break things down exceptionally well um we talk about the difference between trademark and copyright in that episode we really break down some specific contracts like the board api club um license and terms and conditions and really get into some of what's vague there what we can know based on that license gave our thoughts on the rider rips lawsuit that's um that's out and we then identified some additional thorny areas of ip rights when it comes to nfts and the blockchain so we're going to dive deeper now into that thorniness and also excitingly talk about some potential solutions that that remaster is working on but before we get into all of that good stuff i do have to ask that you please subscribe to this podcast if you are listening uh on apple or spotify or wherever you get your podcast or uh yes alex is pointing or subscribe to the youtube channel if you're watching this on youtube it would mean the world to me and help this show grow um and then before we dive into all the good stuff here is a word from our lovely lovely

that we really started to get into last episode and max i think you do a really good job of breaking down distorting this we're going to take it in a couple parts i think the first part we want to address is this problem that you keep raising which is that the blockchain is really good at helping us identify ownership right i own this token if i sell this token to you you own this token and that token being some combination of like a smart contract and you know pointing to an art asset on ipfs but what this space has evolved into is this token also has all these rights associated with it that's the quote-unquote utility that we think matters so much in nft land and we do not at this point have a really good like those rights are not in that smart contract along with the token that we just bought so like it's almost like there's this missing middle communication layer connecting the token that we purchased with the rights that are supposedly associated with that token and the fact that we don't have this communication layer can cause some problems so i just gave that overview but max maybe starting with you do you want to elaborate on that and then you know you give a good example i think with real estate and then maybe start talking about how remaster is approaching this problem yes so first off you actually did an exceptionally good job at i just listened to you explain it in the last podcast episode so i think i pretty much myself uh explain it again because uh maybe i'll be a little rusty but no fundamentally you're you're exactly correct you know the blockchain is fantastic at proving possession ownership provenance so ownership of these tokens associated to wallet addresses how they transact from one wallet to the next and these tokens you know as jeremy basically stipulates with his copyright layer cake points to different components with nfts that are you know so popular right now digital collectibles are images part of that nft actually points to a specific file that's not actually held within the nft so that same high level concept exists in relation to rights ownership rights so nfts which are tokens effectively digital assets we understand the asset and the possession of the asset is is handled by the blockchain but the issue is in relation to the permissions around utilizing these assets and right now why we're seeing such a you know this prescient use case is in relation to digital assets specifically art and commercial rights commercial rights are permissions to utilize this specific work of art in a specific way all of these utilities essentially are defined in these legal contracts that are written in text by you know some of these lawyers right now on the call right now have done an amazing job writing the actual lexicon around permissioned use of these said assets the issue is that in the blockchain or on the blockchain which is a you know hyper-liquid environment pseudo-anonymous environment most of these contracts are held on amazon web services you know ipfs at best but they are static files that exist in their own sort of as their own entity and they don't actively communicate with the actual asset so you have asset which the ownership and possession and sort of permission around using that asset is governed in the actual smart contract the erc 721 logic so transfer from it's very very primitive logic it's you know vending machine logic i put money in and you know the asset effectively transfers from one wallet to the next complex permissions such as commercial rights for other utilities that are defined in these legal contracts don't actively communicate with the asset i mean they're written in actual text so you have this disconnect between what the law lawyers creators want you to actually do with your asset you know the permissions what you can or cannot do with your asset and the actual on-chain logic that's happening on the blockchain so what remaster is doing is effectively working with lawyers utilizing their you know custom lexicon that they they write so well associating specific logic with the actual text and permissioning based on what that actual text says so if you're talking about a license for example a license essentially is a permission to utilize an asset in a specific way so the way we go about it is permissioning people to add specific subcontracts associated to these specific assets so without getting into you know too much granular detail you can effectively imagine the permissions of a legal contract having on-chain actionability through actual logic because we're turning a legal contract in to its own smart contract so now you have a legal contract that exists as a smart legal contract and then there are a few additional functions within this new erc 721 that are bound together and the actual legal contract can add more complex permissioning around how this nft is utilized by the token holder and is interact with and transacted on the blockchain so i'm going to pull the lawyers into this in a second to talk about like in the absence of this what are some of these like worst case scenarios we could see but max going off of that and you explaining what remaster is doing could you speak about it in specifics like could you give an example of of what you might do with a with a remastered smart legal contract or how you might use that in a practical way yeah um happy too so in this first uh project that we're actually doing um with the haas brothers multi-beast and utah so the haas brothers you know have 20 years of brand equity that they would like to protect but they also want to engage within this web 3 ethos of allowing the community to engage in a new methodology of ownership and ownership rights the issue that we're contending within the space now is you basically have two options it's i'm gonna give you rights and i'm never gonna sue you and i'm sure i'm gonna get pushback from all his lawyers but i'm going to say it anyway or the counterpoint of that is you know i'm keeping all of these rights and if you do anything i will sue you so there is no nuance there's no balance that because there's been no infrastructure to allow these things to to actively communicate so what we're effectively doing is saying you own this asset you own this collectible but you will have the permission to engage in some of these licenses as vetted based on what the creator is saying so the creator is the one generating the asset they should have the ability to determine how they want people to use these assets so they will be bringing licenses to the ecosystem that the community will be able to opt in and exercise their own unique ownership rights based on you know certain eligibility requirements but it's effectively a way to have a more hybrid approach of imparting certain ownership rights to the community and having them engage with these licenses or ownership rights as you know things effectively come up so to be specific you could imagine and i'm going to talk about vegadies here but specific vague ideas um you can imagine the haas brothers uh bringing a large apparel deal for example to the community and saying hey we're going to permission eligible token holders to engage with this specific license so we're effectively turning on the specific ownership right in relation to apparel this deal and in right exactly so you have this base contract which determines ownership rights of possession of the actual asset and then this specific license which is a subcontract which inherits the logic and variables from these preceding mother contracts if you will and certain token holders with the necessary permission and eligibility status will be able to engage directly in these licenses and buy their own volition opt in or opt out to some of these larger brand deals and tactically speaking is that like they they sign a thing they click button yes so from that perspective they will have to actually look through the specific base contract they'll have to go through the the actual licensing agreement this licensing agreement is dynamic and will actually inherit the their wallet address and all the necessary variables associated to that and they will verifiably have to sign that agreement not just you know a pdf docusign agreement and not just a metamask signature we're actively adding a few additional components to utilizing metamask not in terms of of creating a brand new signature product but the way that we're compiling the constituent information of what's associated with a metamask signature so just to get a little specific there metamask when you sign something on the blockchain there is a hash associated to a blockchain transaction but if you wanted to find the context of what that user actually signed it's only associated to a blockchain transaction so that blockchain transaction is not actually connected to the specific legal contract associated with that blockchain transaction so there's a huge disconnect so it's again the ownership piece is clearly established you're signing away ownership and that's obvious what's not obvious that is that you're also signing away rights that maybe you had associated with that and and so that's where this is disconnect exists okay right so what we're working on as just one component of enforceability that we're adding is and i'm sure all of these lawyers will be able to talk significantly better about this concept of privity and manifestation of ascent to ensure that users downstream buyers are actually providing their conscious acquiescence to the actual signature and we will verifiably be able to prove through this sort of logic of you know the e-sign act of 2000 which is already established but instead of verifying all of the information from a centralized source such as you know docusign hello son adobe sign whatever we will be pulling various constituent components from the blockchain so the text of the legal contract stored on ipfs the smart contract logic associated with this legal contract the actual nft the text has rendered on this variable uh on this legal contract and in that sequence of events be able to verifiably take to a judge this hashing sequence of hey this person located at this specific wallet address we can get into an uh anonymity later um but effectively sign this document with this specific text as rendered on this specific date on this specific time and now compile all this information together to to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this person provided their acquiescence uh consciously and actively okay we'll we'll get more into all of that and then the practicalities and what you're describing with the solution but stepping back let's i'd love to bring the lawyers in here to kind of explain like in the absence of this like what could go wrong so you know i want to do a whole part two on the transfer of assets which we've already started to get into because it's tied in with all of this but this this core problem which is that the the rights that are associated with my token are sort of abstracted away from any interaction i have in buying that token what are what are scenarios that could play out that might be bad like if we if like could i be sued because i don't actually have commercial rights over this thing and i'm trying to use them commercially like what could go wrong maybe sarah i'll start with you since you're our newcomer unless you want to punt it to somebody else well i'm sure that we all have things to say about this because this is of course exactly what we're focusing on right now and max actually used a term that i think is really important which is the hybrid approach and so i think that in the absence of having something that is definitively attached to the token what we have is we have a hybrid approach that we're looking at to figure out what rights are transferring or not transferring with with each of the tokens what that does is it creates a lot of opportunity for there to be inconsistent language for there to be inconsistent connection between the the collector of the nft and what's been stated in terms of of what those rights are and so um if we've got something for instance and i know that that both um daniel and jeremy can speak to this as well a lot of what we're doing is is creating terms and conditions for websites um where these tokens are being dropped and sold those terms and conditions live on the website and they're not attached to the token which means that people have to somehow know where to go back to now it's it's relatively easy when you're talking about uh projects that are well known but not all the projects are board apes or crypto punks you know there are a lot of other projects out there and it's not so clear and evident to the holders of those tokens they need to go back to the website and read the terms and conditions you'll also see information in the frequently asked questions on the website those faqs may be different in some way from the terms and conditions and then which one is going to control then you may have some information that's attached separately to the token itself and that's the thing that i keep advocating for is that if you have rights that you want to delineate for a particular asset you need to separately write it out and attach it through the metadata of the token itself so that it travels with the nft and anybody who's interested in you know figuring out what rights travel with the nft all they have to do is look at the metadata of that token and follow that link to see that the articulation but again that articulation could differ from what's on the website so part of our jobs as lawyers is to look at all of the different places where that language could live so that we have consistency not only in what's stated but also um you know we're paying attention to how people access that and what that means down the road because you're absolutely right what will and has been happening and is going to continue to happen is that it will result in lawsuits when people are doing things that they're either not authorized to do and don't realize it not authorized to do and do realize it you know or that or that things have been unclearly stated and so there's truly a miscommunication as to what was intended to be transferred let me ask a specific specific hypothetical like is is a risk here as things are currently constructed i mentioned last time the hypothetical example of like jimmy suing ryder rips for use of his broad ape in a derivative work could uh could ryder's defense come back and say you actually never had commercial rights to this for this to begin with because you never signed a thing or on this terms and conditions on this website is so abstracted away from this token you own that a judge could like throw out the case on the grounds that jimmy actually doesn't have those commercial rights to begin with is that a risk because these two things are sort of abstract from one another i mean i think you're going to have risks and daniel and jeremy please jump in but i think you're going to have risks at every single level of the analysis as to whether things are protectable to begin with as to if they are protectable what rights were transferred or not transferred the copyright law does allow for um licenses to be given that don't require signature of the of the creator if you're giving away rights and we can i imagine you spoke a bit about cc0 in the last podcast we can get back into that again today if it makes sense but you know there are different ways to manage rights and um but but normally speaking the purchaser does not receive copyrights to the underlying asset uh unless that there is a transfer that is in writing signed by the person holding the copyright so that you know that creates of course um a very specific area where there could be some challenges and and it's possible that that jimmy being who jimmy is like has that from yugo lads on a one-to-one basis but then if we if we look at like a bigger picture here like okay so you know maybe there's sort of some one-to-one thing that happened but like does just an abstract kind of terms and conditions on a website hugo labs to 10 000 people does it kind of conf if it says it confers that right does it con for that right and i feel like the answer i'm getting is like i think well i actually i don't i i think there are problems but i actually think that it does confer that right i don't think that's really unsettled i actually think there's been we've been operating in a world of open source licenses and creative commons licenses for for decades now um i think i mentioned during the last episode there has been very little litigation um around those issues but i think it's generally accepted that if you're the creator of something and let's put aside whether they're copyrightable you know and i think it might depend on the nft project but i think a lot of the artwork that we're discussing that you discuss on on your podcast carly i believe most of it vast majority um is gets should get copyright protection let's put that aside artist creates a piece of artwork and they announce publicly and they put a document that is their document it's not a forgery they put it up on the website and they say people that acquire you know copies of this through this means or that this is going to be the license that's attached to them something that's you know you might call an open license it's kind of you know a community license a general use license those i believe are enforceable i don't think that uh there's much challenge that those rights are enforceable um so i don't think that's where like i think if writer came back to jimmy and said hey you don't have those rights i don't think the court's really going to hear that argument when there's a document right there that was published by the creator by the author saying you do have those rights i don't think okay the court will really entertain that i in my in my opinion there is risk with all of this but i think max really nailed it on the head i think the value that platforms like the one remaster is working on the value that they bring is about bringing this ecosystem to the next level it's allowing it to evolve and expand because it's very limited in the way it is right now because like max said you actually max you mentioned two paradigms which is give everything give all the commercial rights to people or keep all the rights the third one is one sarah just mentioned which is cc0 i'm going to give all the ipo rights away to everyone not just the holders but the entire community and i think that for a fully decentralized ecosystem that involves ip to materialize you need to have nuance you need to have the ability to grant licenses for some situations but not others to grant it for some countries but not others to do it based on duration on type on the you know proposed derivative work you know you know if you're an artist like the haas brothers you're going to be very protective over uh the uses of your artwork and what people do but you know you could imagine somebody that owns one of these pieces and saying hey i just made a really cool animation that uh you know using my artwork that i want to feature on on this platform or that platform and they might say you know what we love this great go for it and they might say great go for it let's split the revenue they might say go do it and take all the revenue they may say let's donate it there's you can imagine a million different arrangements that could happen and to me you can't and you can't do that without in the present system so to me the risk of the present system is a little bit less about the risk that nft owners are going to be sued for you know not having rights that they think they have i think that people that have commercial rights have them it's more about the limitations that the current system brings on the on the market but you know i think jeremy you're bringing up a really good point about all the nuances in between because it's not just keep all the rights or give away all the rights there's everything in between i think the real problem comes in changing those rights so if you put out one day that you're giving certain rights and then you decide i don't really like that i'm going to change it and you change it within the terms and conditions that's a problem so that's a that's a big rabbit hole i would love to go down let me but right before we do that max giving the thumbs up before we do that help me understand why we couldn't create this nuance within the current system why couldn't we just have more nuanced terms and conditions that outline okay it's this for this country it's this for jurisdiction like why does it need to be taken off of the website and and put somewhere else when you get downstream you've got an nft that's completely separated from the terms and conditions of the original website where it was dropped and there's not necessarily any connection that could be made and so people aren't going to go digging for that information it's the trade that that transfer piece right i was gonna say there's there's a couple concepts that we need to make sure we're clear on here there's the concept of can it transfer the rights and i think all the attorneys agree theoretically under legal theory yes it can you know terms and conditions on website etc the other side of that is does it okay and then prove it and that's the problem because you can't if you get into a lawsuit for whatever reason you can't just run into court and say well yeah the terms and conditions said so judge you actually have to get those terms and conditions into evidence and you have to prove that those were the terms and conditions that existed at the point at the time of origin and that's a lot of the issue that we're having to deal with is having to say okay right this isn't like um like when i buy when you buy a house right now right and there's a there's a deed and you can go to the county recorder's office and you can follow it all the way back and you can say okay here's the first d the second d 30 and you can take it all the way through it's all there it's all time recorded we know what happened when because you know they put them in a book sequentially here if i go back to say the hugo labs website okay but you know i see the terms and conditions there how do i know that's the terms and conditions that existed on the date that that particular nft was minted i i don't know and then i've got to get that into court and i've got to prove it somehow if i'm in a dispute and again i don't know and i'm using i'm using litigation as an example here keep in mind this is also applicable if your due diligence if you're conducting due diligence on a transaction of some sort somebody says hey you know somebody comes to me says hey dan i want to invest a bunch of money in this company um but i need to make sure that they own all the ip or they've got all the rights they claim to have same kind of analysis is going to apply okay well did did they own the rights what did they give away and what is the current state of the of the ecosystem there so those are two very the can and did and prove it are two very well three very different things go ahead alex and then i yeah so um one of the things that uh we're working on i is this idea of legal provenance like an ether scan for legal signatures that you could verify on a decentralized website uh that looks at the blockchain and says this metamask that owned this digital asset at the time signed the terms and conditions or did not plan the terms and conditions um i i think in circling back to a few things that that you uh brought up currently one is let's put jimmy aside for a second uh because jimmy's special we all know jimmy's special shout out to jimmy um it i'm one of the five or ten thousand board ape holders that was duplicated in the rider reps situation and i did not file copyright there are two components of that one if i was the original mentor very clear direct provenance between yoga signing the terms on the site and acquisition of digital assets if i'm a reseller or a third second fourth owner of this digital asset that nexus gets pulled apart jeremy did bring up a great point on the last podcast shout out to part one of this that if you are relying on the representations in those terms and conditions it's hard to say that you didn't read them right it's hard to say that they're unenforceable um the second component to that right uh is we i think we mentioned previously the hugo labs hired artists i believe uh that were they were work for hire to to yes um to create the images and components along with others and the body shape the hat the jacket the ears etc uh i i'd be hard-pressed to find uh any judge to not say that that did not include a modicum which is the only requirement to to be imbued copyright creativity of creativity uh in a tangible form and there's a great uh twitter thing of like the actual original hand drawings which i somehow found a very deep dark web but that clearly has copyright associated with it now the mixture of the hat and the jacket or uh the robot body versus this body uh yes that was auto generated upon mint but the constituent components of it um are for sure have copyright protection associated with it so i'd be hard-pressed to find that yuga did not have the original copyright again this is my opinion and not that every master but that yuca had the original copyright that was based on the terms and conditions and license on the website that was then passed as it says you own the underlying art completely um which which is a big component of it yes you have hard issues with title 17 and copyright transfers have to be in writing and ownership as it says in the terms and conditions is entirely mediated by smart contract and unfortunately i was like one of the uh besides the d-gen's out there going through the entire 1800 lines of smart contract code it doesn't mention copyright transfer it does mention that dm gargamel apparently in the discord which is kind of funny by a smart contract developer a shout out to anyone that actually finds that besides me um but uh it brings up some interesting components that i think you need to consider in making this analysis you just made this point about like copyright transfer and i want to double click on this for a second which is that we established last time that there's sort of two different things there's full copyright transfer and then there's granting people licenses to use copyright in various ways and in licenses that allow you to use copyright in various different ways there's exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to use that copyright in different ways and those each have different implications in a case of like full copyright transfer the law stipulates that you need to have a signature in order for that copyright transfer to go through and i'm gonna have you guys confirm that but and and that obviously would pose all sorts of issues in this world because we don't have that kind of thing happening right now where we have like actual signatures and a and a metamask signature would not count for this it's that full copyright transfer thing as it currently stands seems like it's it's sort of off the table but these granting licenses for people to use copyright could still be on the table is that a correct summary i would say so um and you know jeremy and i were just talking about this yesterday about how and this is going to be maybe a um non-obvious comment but ultimately copyright ownership might not be what what really matters what really matters is the licensing of the rights that you can you know that you can then use so i see i see the waving um so you know ultimately it doesn't really matter if you transfer the copyright to the subsequent owners or not what you want to know is what can i do with it people aren't really that interested in registering their copyrights that's not the end game here the end game is what derivative rights can i make how what commercial use can i make of this and of course you know we've got the added issues of um a lot of this being pseudonymously executed so you know you've got to when you're creating the the licensing terms you've got to think about enforcement and so there are a couple of things that i think remaster is working on that address not only the ability to articulate the licensed rights that that travel on and whether that's exclusive non-exclusive and you know carly the the other element to that would be whether it's sub-licensable or not or whether it's exclusive to the owner because that becomes a huge issue in the creation of derivative works um but you know but also figuring out how to indicate that uh within the smart contract structure and logic i i just i i wanted to echo um and amplify what sarah just expressed so eloquently uh and and there's a reason for it carly and i'll bring it up there's you know there's this report that's floating around by galaxy digital i don't know if you saw this um but galaxy digital put out this sort of click i think it's very click baity salacious report where they say when you buy an nft you don't actually obtain any ip ownership at all um and they you know they suggest that even the projects that grant broad commercial rights you know you're not really getting anything at all you're just getting a license is this sort of the suggestion like you're not getting copyright you're just getting a license and they're shouting this from the rooftops and i i think that what sarah just you know zoomed in on is so critical for the community to understand that this is what we call in law school a distinction without a difference for the most part okay and i'm gonna read now from the copyright act one sentence from the copyright act we're gonna do one sentence from a statute and it's very simple and it says that when you it says the owner of any particular exclusive right that means like an exclusive license right the owner of any particular exclusive right is entitled to the extent of that right to all of the protection and remedies accorded to the copyright owner by this title okay that means that when you get an exclusive license and i would submit that even if it doesn't have the word exclusive if it's talking about a commercial license that's going out to the owners of these nft projects and it says you have a broad commercial right where it says you have an exclusive right that you have all of the protection and remedies accorded to the copyright owner of this title it also by the way note that it says the owner of any particular exclusive right so copyright talks about owning an exclusive license and they talk about you have all the rights of a copyright owner so this suggestion that just by not having the whole pie the entire copyright you're somehow in a lesser position than a licensee is just plain wrong and so that is just miseducation that i believe is putting out there for um click bait and to create controversy that i don't believe actually exists we're going to clip this this is the moment we're going to clip this moment in the podcast circulate that on twitter and i invite galaxy digital to come on and and debate me on this novographs anywhere please yeah but the concept that i want to highlight there is like copyright license it's all a permission to do something with your asset and if that permission is decentralized to the point where if we agree to this term and i'm not violating anything then this contract will not change based on my own understanding it cannot change so like for one example when we talk about decentralized terms and conditions um royalties is a big sort of uh i think royalties actually just change of one of the of the me bits contract and it may say in that terms and conditions hey we reserve the right to change these royalties whenever we want and forget about the legality of that if i'm a meebits holder and the creator changes the royalties with without my knowledge it is materially affecting my asset and if i haven't actually provided my conscious awareness or acquiescence because i haven't you know utilized something for commercial rights but i'm just holding on to this asset passively and now they're upping the royalties that materially changes the value of my asset from a liquidity perspective so could you say would you have grounds to sue in that scenario not if that's what you agreed to i mean yeah that's why go for it i was gonna say and that that's why there is maybe in terms of in terms of a pure litigation standpoint there's there can be very limited differences to no differences you know just difference without a distinction between ownership and license but in terms of valuation i'll say that usually ownership is valued at higher than a license even an exclusive license there's something that attaches to ownership that is worth a little bit more money i i just i'm trying to keep pulling us back to what is the consequence of this murkiness and then max i want you to finish your thought but so in this like what is the consequence of this murkiness if if you know me bits changes the royalty structure in their license in the current environment where i never kind of consciously signed anything and at no point like what is the consequence to that murkiness and the fact that these terms and conditions keep changing you know in a worst-case scenario let's say and and it could be like litigating against now hugo labs who owns me bits but that's what daniel actually just pointed out is that the the value of the asset may change based on that uncertainty and so um if if when you purchase the asset you say that you agree to the terms and conditions and the terms and conditions say we can change the royalty at any time then there's an argument to be made that you bought it with the understanding that that was the structure that you were buying into and so that's what you've bought but when you've got again downstream purchasers who aren't necessarily going back and reading those terms and conditions and don't know that those are terms and conditions that apply to that asset that's where it becomes very murky and that's where you have the likelihood of lawsuits coming up where the downstream purchaser goes well i didn't know that you could impact the value of my asset at any time without my input and that's not okay and i'm gonna challenge that and the me bits guys or whoever are gonna say well that's that's the way we set up the project it's your problem that you didn't take a look at the rules and that's again why i keep shouting from the rooftops or spitting into the wind depending on the day that we need to attach these things to the nfts and that's more than um just having a signed contract i mean that's taking the remaster capabilities but taking it again a step further where it's not just about putting it into the smart contract it's about making sure that you have that articulation securely associated and embedded within the nft structure you asked for you asked for worst case scenario in all of this everything we've talked about are the one-off you know potential lawsuits between you know the the issuer and the holder or you know maybe your company is not worth as much on a fund raise as you thought it would be these are all you know things that affect one person here and there i would submit the worst case scenario is that a whole bunch of people lose a whole bunch of money and congress gets involved and now we start getting heavy-handed regulation handed down by people who do not fully understand the industry and are just taking broad wax because there's public outcry against what has happened i would submit that that might be the worst case scenario here or perhaps that people who would otherwise be onboarded to the web 3 environment lose complete faith in this structure as a as a place to to operate in any legitimate way and just don't participate and then you've got a problem because you don't have ongoing onboarding which means that the whole ecosystem suffers and does not take off in the way that it has the potential to yeah so there's there's a few things i guess really to unpack number one is and it sort of ties back into your infrastructure why the current infrastructure is is not working for today carly and it's primarily based on because we're using web to legal infrastructure it's why jack dorsey is like i'm building web5 because what's going on today is people are using the current legal system that has worked for large you know tech enterprises like terms of service agreement where people are accessing their content based on the terms of service but when i'm accessing to content you know whether it's a subscription i don't actually own that specific asset so access to the content is conditional based on me logging onto the website every single time when i own an asset i'm effectively perpetually logged on for the duration of ownership of that asset so right now we're trying to find ways of large brands or large creators limiting their own liability in relation to whether or not they can or cannot do stuff and that's fine i don't even we don't have to get in there more existential but why it doesn't work in this ecosystem we've talked about downstream buyers downstream buyers the blockchain is the blockchain web 3 is web3 because of this level of hyper liquidity where assets can move around fluidly in a hyperliquid trustless environment and the bulk of these transactions are happening on these marketplaces openc looks rare whatever essentially and because there's no infrastructure in relation to the signing and the legality of the actual contracts that are being imparted there is a massive issue that we've all highlighted but just to get a little more granular as to why it's a big issue and i think miles jennings actually highlights this in uh in one of his a16z papers where you can actually see like the blockchain then you have smart contract protocol layer then you have the client layer which is effectively where open see all of these platforms sit on that client layer which is not as foundational as a smart contract protocol layer they say these are the terms of service the only way you can use openc is by green to our terms of service yeah you sign a metamask thing but that's you know it's a click wrap agreement of you agreeing you know having access to openc for example i'm just using openc because it's the biggest player not pointing blame directly going to open c but effectively because the access to these assets is based on a user complying with open seas terms of service my experience of my asset is subjectively based on open seas platforms terms of service even though it's my asset and even though my asset exists on this entire protocol so why this infrastructure breaks down is board ape um you know seth green had his board ape stolen and it was verified to a seth green went to openstack said hey my my board ape is stolen so the the asset was flagged on openc openc said hey you're not allowed to transact this asset on our platform limiting their own liability but that asset was still able to transact on you know 30 other marketplaces that don't care about limiting their liability from that specific perspective so now you have open seas platform terms of service which doesn't actually impede the transactability of the asset and this is one of the real issues that is being highlighted when you have legal contracts which determine asset flow permissions of interaction with an actual asset but they're not communicating they're not remotely linked with one another so this asset can transact on looks rare but not open c and now we're starting to realize that the breakdown of this infrastructure is is not supported because of this lack of yes enforceability but it's why at remaster we're adamant about shifting the needle from retroactive enforceability which is hey i can prove that you've done all these things wrong so now i'm going to sue you or now i'm going to you know rectify the action versus building programmatic logic alongside the intent of the creator and the lexicon of these lawyers deploying that as its own smart contract so you can build legal rails bumper rails you go bowling and you know putting out the the the side rails to limit the potential misuse of the asset whether it's intended or unintentional i mean no one has any idea what they're doing in this space let's just be honest and assets are being misused all the time not by bad actors necessarily so providing bumpers allows not just enforceability from a large fortune 500 company to feel comfortable but just from a misusing to allow genuine consumers who don't have a physics degree you don't have like a phd in like you know computer science to interact in this space without feeling like their stuff is going to get stolen i mean it happens all the time like you see ceos of these web 3 companies including myself who have had assets stolen from phishing attacks just because of the the lack of um you know ui ux enforceability it's just it's a learning process at the core are you saying in that last bit that we need to take this stuff out of the platform level right right now it's like subjective like openc can decide one thing looks where i can decide another thing magic eden has come out said we're not going to freeze your assets like it's taking it out of the platform layer and putting it that layer below right like saying two layers it's saying it needs to be connected to the the original nft smart contract itself yes the rules of the asset does that have any implications for for individual buyers then the implication is you're agreeing to something you understand the terms around how you can interact with your asset as defined by what the creator is actually intending if you don't agree with that and no one agrees with that then the asset won't be created in the first place so it's like this weird chicken or the egg thing of like i'm a creator i want to control how people are using my asset or not control but it's of my own volition if you agree to that we've both agreed so you still have this permissioned infrastructure based on like law but now because you're building in logic once we've both agreed to these terms now i can't change it you can't change it unless we both come back again and agree and that's where the trustless component comes in and that's where the nuance of of uh you know web 2 and web 3 comes immutable x is the layer 2

help me i feel like i have this very primitive understanding of of your solution and my very primitive understanding is okay you've effectively convinced me that just having some terms and conditions on a website even if they were super nuanced while maybe end up covering and protecting all the parties that need to be covered and protected downstream it's way too tenuous for any of us to want to feel good about that and so we really need to take this we need to move away from like okay i've got some terms and conditions up here on a website and like you've all kind of agreed to it like la da into something that's a lot more substantive but when i'm kind of picturing that in my head i'm picturing like here's the the the the terms and conditions on the website and we're now putting it into the smart contract you're clearly talking about something deeper than that because you're talking about taking this legal language and actually turning it into programmatic language and my brain hasn't really caught up to the implications of that or what that tactically means sure so i guess what it tactically means is like in these legal contracts you have text that is the code around determining what you can or cannot do with your asset it's like this is then logic if you do this then this would happen then i sue you if you misuse this asset then i see you it's all that's effectively what legal text is and it implies that the event has to happen in order for you to say hey you did this on this point you misused this asset now because you agree to this contract i can sue you but in web 3 because of the liquidity you could have a thousand a hundred thousand transactions of an asset in a week and let's just assume we had this signature infrastructure where every 100 000 you know users signed the actual contract and we did have grounds to sue them how do you litigate a hundred thousand or a thousand transactions in the span of a week like that is sounds like chaos i mean maybe this is a another conversation but so let me let me pause you there stay on your thought but i just want to like so so so one thing that you guys are doing remaster is doing if i get it from what you just said is like creating the capacity for these signatures so that every downstream buyer is in privity with the mothership these were terms you guys were using last time about what the terms and conditions are at any given point in time right so max you're selling your board ape to me in the flow of that process i'm properly signing something that is effectively like an agreement i'm agreeing to the terms and conditions that are now attached to this asset in real time while i'm buying them so that we can look back legally and say okay great carly agreed to xyz and and and hugo labs because i'm buying your board or whatever agreed to xyz tacitly like in the moment that this this sale happened and that cleans up some of this from uh if this was to go to court right that's one thing you're saying okay now you're bringing up this point you're saying it's so liquid let's say that hap that happens a hundred thousand times like ah how are we supposed to litigate and and something had gone wrong in one of the in one point in that chain and now it's like oh my gosh now what are we doing litigating these hundred thousand things you said that's even in the case where you get these signatures what are you doing how is your solution helping with that problem because as i said before these legal contracts are text like as you we're using like english language to determine how people can use their asset if you can turn that english language into programmatic code so like that's right then is helpful because if then is super helpful it's like if you have a certain permission you can interact with this specific license if you don't have that permission you can't engage in that license so it's this like minority report thing where like you can't commit the crime because you literally just cannot do it you can't interact with your asset in that specific way so let's so okay so for example i it's always helpful in my opinion to get like really specific so grails 2 just dropped and if you have a moon bird that has a grit that has grails traits you were entitled to um to to grails to get a girl now this is kind of a weird example because this is just token dating and we already have this technology but like you're saying if this was sort of like this broader right that was conferred as part of the terms and conditions or maybe we can make this apply for your hof brothers example where like they want to partner with an apparel company you would have a logic within the within the the sort of smart legal contract as you've been calling it that would allow or prevent certain transactions to go through based on the rights that have been conferred is that what you're suggesting yes sounds very hard that's why i'm i'm not the technical one maybe we can do uh uh the the more technical version and have our cto on but uh yeah i i would say it's actually kind of relatively simple from leveraging the blockchain for what it does great which is a distributed ledger right and it's this wallet this point in time owns this digital collectible that has this right to sell a t-shirt and as soon as that digital collectible is sold on the secondary market that wallet no longer has the right to sell this t-shirt through this media but how the smart contract doesn't know if i'm selling a t-shirt so yeah you connect your wallet to essentially uh an e-commerce site right like a a token assuming it reminds me of the royalties problem conversation that we're having where it's really hard you can't really enforce royalties on chain and so what it strikes me and maybe correct me is like well max is giving me or i please chime in on that max i mean that's the topic du jour you can't i mean you can enforce royalties it's just this is i mean this gets more into like some of the issues with standardization and eip and actually enforcing that stuff like if you move into standardization you have to give up a lot of certain things if you want every single marketplace to inherit certain logic sure then you need to give up certain components but for example you could theoretically say if you you cannot sell this on openc or any place for under five ethereum and you can bake that in to a smart contract well okay so but but let's like let's let's do this right like that gets because yes the the the the solution to the royalties problem that i feel like i hear floating around is we could have some centralized list of marketplaces or you know some list maybe a dow forms it'll be a centralized list but there's a list somewhere that is contributed to that says these are the whitelisted marketplaces and these are the blacklisted marketplaces based on royalties and yes you could have a smart contract that goes and looks and says okay is this is this marketplace on the whitelist or the blacklist and behave some way accordingly but there are still lots of ways around that so i think what we're getting what you're what you're getting at here is like you cannot 100 enforce me selling a t-shirt on the blockchain because i could go out and do it independently myself but what you are doing is now establishing a precedent where like it becomes a lot easier to win a legal case it just goes a lot simpler to win a legal case if i want to sue someone for using my ape that they previously owned on their t-shirt or whatever and they actually didn't have that right they signed away that right in this signature moment that now happens when they sold me their asset because a lot easier for me to go to a judge and prove hey they don't have the right to make that t-shirt anymore because look here on the blockchain certified providence whatever on this date at this time they signed away that right and they they actually signed it and that itself may deter like whatever that can be a big win without it being like directly enforceable by the smart contract itself can i can i i want to add something that we haven't talked about which is a real i think real important upgrade and and benefit that could be brought by a platform like remasters and that's about um when you know if you if you get a commercial license and you get rights to do something with your with your nfp or if you get utility or benefits right like you get to redeem get certain merchandise get tickets to a show get tacos for life whatever it is the problem right now is that there's no visibility um and there's no connections that show to the a downstream buyer what rights have been exercised what's been out there already right and so if i and let's just take an example if i have my if i have a pfp and i've used it on a food truck and i licensed it for a t-shirt and then i want to go and sell my token yeah there's both like the licensing question of like well do i does it cut my legs out from under me like once i sell once i sell my token do i have to stop using those things and i would say you know if you look at the new crypto punks license it does a it's very clear about what happens um to those rights and if you have something that you used um that's out there in the world that's been published and used you can continue using it um but that's also like a one-size-fits-all option i think what would really in order for this world to evolve and develop and for people to invest money into these things they have to have the security that if you get a piece of art and you want to invest money into a derivative project you want to make a television show you want to make a video game um and then maybe you want to sell the nft subject to that existing license continuing on and being able to continue on there's no way to do that now there's no way to tell people about it and having a platform that sort of identifies and manages and communicates to the market says okay i'm gonna buy this how much juice has been squeezed out of lemon what is it that i'm buying what's the car report on this nft which are is there merchandise i can still redeem did somebody already use that you know redeem the tacos for life what's coming with it and none there's no mechanic for that and i think we're talking about licensing but i think the remaster platform or something like it that allows you to track the different activations that have been executed in connection with nft and communicate that is a tremendous um tool and something that the community really needs in order to build this out i've used this example before but it's effectively like i want to know if if the world of women i'm buying has starred in a porno like i need to know if like if she's been like licensed somewhere to somebody to do something like you know that i maybe don't want to be associated with and right now it's just like a black box what other agreements might exist between a particular asset and and so having that and you know kind of you have this standard whatever smart legal contract that i've latched onto that term and then you can kind of add these sub licenses on top and it all travels with the nft so that's no longer a black box i think you you gave the example last time max on the same exact front around real estate like if if there's like other debts associated with the house or the property like when you buy a deed to a house you know you know any hindrances that are kind of coming along with it and we need that in nfds alex i think there was something you wanted us to circle back to around this issue of of litigation and who has a right to sue yeah and and the crucial part is how do we get our foot in the door of court right and yes uh as an artist a creative and etc you immediately get copyright uh by fixing your uh modicum of creation of creativity into a tangible form you actually need to register with the uspto for a copyright registration and you could either get accepted copyright or the registration or you could get a denial and have the grounds to sue so i think it it's crucial that although one may have the copyright they may not be afforded the rights of copyright protection if it's an unregistered copyright and just kind of a call back to uh part one of this terrific podcast jeremy you want to add anything on that or well there's two there's two things that come up one is sort of who has the right to sue and you know a copyright owner has the right to sue an exclusive licensee has a right to sue going back to that point of not really and sarah's point of there's not always so much of a difference between the rights of a copyright owner and exclusive licensee then what you're bringing the second point is what do you need to get into court and that's a copyright registration um both an exclusive licensee and the copyright owner can seek a copyright registration but really what i think you're getting at is a broader question which is when you you have a collection of ten thousand visual works um there's sort of a logistical administrative problem at the u.s copyright office that there's no easy way to go and register ten thousand works of art um they don't really allow very expensive and it's small it's expensive when you multiply one you know getting a registration in one piece of art is like you know under 100 bucks but you multiply that times 10 000 and it's prohibited so right you know with the way that generative art is being developed there's not really a great match that's something that sarah should talk about me so i asked this last time but just quickly to bring this back to remaster one of the questions i asked last time was okay let's say i go out and get a copyright registration for my asset and i so i have the right to sue does that transfer with the asset or does the next owner need to go out and try and get a copyright registration is that something that remaster can solve where that can be now affixed to the smart legal contract and a determination can be made like it can it can travel with the copyright registration the thing you need to actually litigate could be transferred with the asset i think the challenge for that is that remaster can't dictate what the copyright office does and in order to transfer copyright ownership according to the copyright office you have to file a transfer document and i will say that the computer systems at the copyright office are pretty um elementary they're not 21st century they are not and it's very generous it really is a problem that you know that there's not even a way to really put a put together a program that can automatically register copyrights because there's no interfacing with the copyright office so that's a whole other bucket of issues but i want to raise one other beautiful news for the blockchain those era right like to record copyright on the blockchain and publicly available would be a terrific use case for the uspto and web3 yes that's very complicated and definitely requires an entirely new conversation um but i want to raise one other really important issue which is that we're talking about u.s law right now a lot of these sales are not necessarily in the us like we've got jurisdictional issues and not every country in fact you the us is the only country that requires registration in order to to establish the right to sue so when we're talking about either assets that are created in other countries or people who are living in other countries buying these things we've got some uh we've got some bigger problems too yeah we could we could have a whole separate a whole separate podcast on you know burn convention and all the other degrees about recognizing other countries rights etcetera it's it's that's going to be a real interesting problem it's the a-lev layer or layer a that we teased on the end of the last podcast the authenticity layer there's one thing i wanted to circle back though just just briefly in terms of carly what you brought up around transferring copyright well that's not something that we are doing or because we have to contend with you know ancient industry ancient technology and it's not necessary um what we are able to do is based on these permissions so licenses for example there are two options if i own a board ape i could license my board ape to adidas for example adidas could say i want the license to follow the nft or i want the license to remain with you the nft holder because i actually know who you are so what that does is put restrictions either restrictions around the transferability of the asset or restrictions around who can engage with the actual license so from that perspective there are certain eligibility requirements to engage with that license with adidas maybe they're like you need to be from nebraska from this specific street and we could have five people fit that eligibility requirement and if i'm the nft holder and i'm in a license with with adidas and that license is bound to the nft i could only transfer it to those five people that meet those eligibility requirements so we're putting a base layer of legal enforceability and once you have that limiting factor you can start to add liquidity back in on the flip side of that is i don't want the license to actually transact with the nft that's when you know the downstream buyer needs to be aware that when they're buying this board ape it no longer comes with that adidas license and that's where the due diligence is crucial so there's two options there both are entirely feasible it's all just a function of logic and transparency yeah that and that's such an important point you know i've been talking about all the the fact that the merger is going through and that means that 99 of the environmental concerns are going to go away and how wonderful that is because it makes the water and ethereum and nfts that much warmer for brands and you're describing a very similar thing which is that there are plenty of brands right now who probably would be very hesitant to engage in a licensing agreement or work with an nft asset because they're like if it gets sold and it gets sold to some you know somebody a murderer or like like we can't have that brand affiliation or whatever the case might be and so this now it sounds like could give them that security and that feeling of like all right i can enter into this because i can clearly stipulate and set all sorts of parameters around what the rules for this asset that's being licensed to me are and i'll be able to have a legal recourse because i'll be able to point to this contract that the two-party signed if it is ever sold i'll have that legal recourse if if they violate that um which is huge so let me ask if if is this something that can be retroactively what you're working on can it be retroactively applied to projects or like does it have to be new projects launching thinking about this out the gate no um it's funny you're bringing this up now because uh it obviously we can't contend with you know the nfts that were already minted um and using our you know standard erc 721 with these few additional functions does allow for this to be baked in you know for new projects it's a little more seamless but for existing assets that are interested in engaging with some of these licenses we could wrap the asset with this permissioned infrastructure that plugs it into our legal architecture and then we're also building this sort of commerce you know sort of hub where people can communicate and interact with one another all around the transfer of assets the subdivision of rights the transfer of those rights together so we would be able to wrap a board ape for example the owner would still you know own the board 8 but they would actually own the wrapped contract and certain permissions around interacting with that ape so one of those permissions is you know if it's a board ape and the licensing ability is with the token holder so if i'm jimmy eath and i've wrapped my board ape i now have permissions to add all of these licenses that comply with our system and we're adding more and more you know every single day so now i can instantiate those licenses so for example i have my nft i have a gaming right license which i've now added on top of this base contract and now i want that gaming right license to make derivative nfts of my initial nft so jenkins of valet and they're sort of derivative assets from that perspective you're able to go back and trace all the preceding contracts are all the dogs she's she loves this field she's so excited about instantiating rights into a wrapped board eth you know yeah she's honestly she's probably just sick and tired of listening to me talk about this um but yeah from that perspective you're now are able to have a numerous amount of derivative assets that are all tracing back through this permissioned infrastructure and because there's this limiting factor of enforceability of like only these people can interact only these people can transact based on these stipulations you start to add liquidity back into the system i mean the way i like to think about it maybe it's a little bit of a cheesy analogy but if you know air tags apple air tags like the risk of losing your keys after you've slapped an air tab you know an air tag onto your keys is that much less and you don't now have to worry about where your keys are every five seconds um i don't know if that was that's the first time trying that analogy so i i like it where my head goes with it and i don't know if this is like tell me if this feels right it's like i'm like look air tags can't 100 fool proof keep you from losing a thing or like you know it's not 100 fail-safe but it's uh whatever it is 75 reduction or 90 whatever in the likelihood that you end up losing or leaving your keys and that that's you know i i see this is honestly what i've been saying about about the royalty problem too is like what we need to do is just make it like highly inconvenient or the best we can do is make it really inconvenient to trade without without royalties we can't 100 enforce it because you can over the counter you can agree to something off chain with somebody and send them a thing and get a payment like you just cannot 100 prevent this but if we can get it down so that it's like really really inconvenient you know we'll at least weed out a bunch of people from from doing it and and to me broadly what you guys are doing is is better than that because you're still going to be able to solve things even if you can't solve something on chain you're giving a way to solve it in the court system um and so you're you know you're you're going that far but that's what i take away from yeah no i mean that's exactly right the one additional thing is you know if you can verifiably prove that something has gone wrong even after the you know the transfer has already happened you can take that evidence to a court and some of this contract arbitration stuff that we're working on where a lawyer you know or an arbiter can render a default judgment and potentially rectify the situation after it's already happened so that you know having that layer for super super super high valued assets is i think crucial if they're ever going to engage in this sort of environment so final question i have a new project launching and i'm like i'm bought in i want to prevent i want to you know prevent any potential litigation i want to work with you what what do they do well we're in the process of redoing our website so i'd say wait until about september 5th to before going to our website uh follow us on twitter dm us or what's the twitter handle uh remaster under underscore i o um that would be the probably the best way to actually contact us until our our website is live but i will also say that we are launching our first project with the haas brothers we touched on them jimmy eath shout out to jimmy who's actually taking this personality test it's this interesting thing where i've personally i've taken it yeah oh carly i forgot you you've actually taken it you can actually speak to it um yeah yeah well you can speak to your experience but yeah we're launching september 19th uh officially so yeah i've talked about this on twitter spaces but you know i think we've more people listen to the podcast so yeah that you know it was a funny thing it's it's not like any personality test you've ever taken and uh i took it in like in a zoom call with like five people other people there i think so i don't want to give anything away but this should encourage people to go and when this project launches go check it out and check out the personality test and then imagine taking that test where you had to verbalize your answers to the questions in a room of like five people and uh hey there was one woman and she was not on camera so as far as i could tell it just looked like five you know i think we realized uh this uh this this may have been awkward you could also reach us at remaster at info remastered dot io for those not info remastered wait one and it's also on max's chat for those watching the youtube so yeah we'll put a link we'll put it in the show notes or something all right well thank you all so much for joining for this for this part two there may be parts three and four we've all been kind of on this on the behind the scenes talking about potential follow-ups all this because i do think getting legal uh not advice not legal advice but legal uh opinions perspectives in this space is super valuable because we're a little bit like cowboys out here running around in the wild west and if we want this to go mainstream we're going to need the grown-ups in the room to come along so um
