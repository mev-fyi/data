everyone has mistakes in crypto bury those mistakes deep down never think about them that's my strategy for coping all the things I've missed David how many things have you missed oh my god I've missed so many things I've missed zero things there's not a single thing that I've had well uh bring that Alpha to me man because I've missed a lot over the years bankless Nation happy fifth Friday of September September 2022 that is David how you doing today absolutely fantastic Ryan how are you good man what are we getting into today uh so you know how was it last week that was like the cope bear Market weekly roll up yeah this one's this one's good one uh nfts came alive this week and a very unexpected ways uh so and the theme of this week is that nft is one bigly uh so I'm pretty stoked about that so is this a glimmer of hope in the midst of the in the bear Market that nfts had a crazy big week oh I I don't really think anyone who's still at this point in this market now is like doubtful about the future of this industry uh and I think this is a great example of a build Market uh prices are down but things are moving uh there are tectonic shifts happening both in the layer 2 space and also in the nft market uh and there's like there's like five different massive things that happened uh and we're gonna talk about all of them because Ryan it's a Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier with a cup of coffee yeah a cup of coffee my I have my cup of coffee I do I know it's a little late for you and by the way David the other reason bankless listeners David is bullish today on today's episode is because he just told me he had a fantastic night of sleep all right occurrence yes and uh David with like nine plus hours of sleep in him is a different David he is a bull market David is that fair yeah people who pay attention to though I have troubles with sleep so when I wake up at somehow 9 A.M after sleeping all the way through the night I get real excited well we got some huge wins across the board in the nft to talk about Christie's doing some stuff also the fidencer Creator just sold out a new batch of nfds yeah what else in the nft world David uh New England Patriots football team are going web3 what the hell does that mean uh and a massive crypto Punk sale uh again uh just and that's just the tip of the iceberg for what happened this week uh of course some bad things did happen as well uh cftc going after Dow token holders joining the ranks of the SEC doing the regulation by enforcement strategy uh we thought we thought the cftc were the good ones um sad but we'll get into all these details and more as we go throughout the weekly roll up before we get in want to tell you about our friends and sponsors at swellnetwork David and I are Angel Investors with this product too because we think it is really cool it's decentralizing ethereum staking David tell them about swell and how people can get involved yeah swell is joining the ranks of rocketpool and Lido as a decentralized staking as a service Dao it's it's permissionless like rocketpool so any node operator can come join the network with a 16 eth Bond but is also permissioned like Lido where Dao or the Dao votes on who is allowed to run a validator node without a bond so both trustless and trusted at the same time trying to go after the Best of Both Worlds uh Community owned and operated Dow they want you in the Discord so they can grow this network out and and so there is a link in the show notes for you to get started with that I just noticed uh Mark Cuban is involved in this too oh wow cool wow yeah Angel Brothers with Mark Cuban all right what's up Mark trying to decentralize staking right here yeah definitely check out that Discord get in on the ground floor of this community uh they're building something really cool all right David let's get to markets today gotta start with King Bitcoin it is still the King right now uh what's it trading at this week as at the time of recording I think this week Ryan the prices this week set an all-time record for the most flat weeks uh we are literally at the same price as we were seven days ago I think Bitcoin is down point one five percent which you know if you're gonna call anything flat in crypto it's that so start of the week at 19 300 ending the week at 19 300. we're flattened Bitcoin we also flat on 8th David same story uh start of the week at 13 20 ending the week at 13 20. wow okay flat wheat crab market as we've called in before I guess the last seven days the crypto markets don't know what to do how are we looking on the ratio David is that giving us any signal in this this is the the Bitcoin ratio well no because everything else is flat too people noticed last week Ryan when we skipped over the BTC ratio we started talking about something about like the eat gas markets and then we just decided to skip the ratio and people were like oh yeah super convenient of David to skip the ratio on like the bad week well were they wrong David yeah they might they might have clued into something perhaps but yes over the two-week period the East BTC ratio is down uh we are down to 0.069 nice um but uh this week is a slot this week was flat this week is flat other week is down kind of weird to see it down post merge I guess maybe are you surprised about that yeah I guess it's the merge unwind but also the bear Market uh again the mer it was the merch trade is never about the week after the merge or the month after the merge it's about the year after the merge uh and the year four now it's going to be saying the next three to five the next three to five not yet not priced in yet guys give it time all right give that Supply burn some time to activate fully are we a good burn day today by the way we'll talk about that how about cryptocurrency market caps as a whole are we above or below a trillion dollars we are below a trillion dollars we're up on the week though so where Bitcoin and ether where the Blue Chips were flat we're actually slightly up on the total crypto market cap uh .094 trillion up to .097 trillion in the last seven days so we went up 30 billion dollars in seven days so that means somebody some tokens in the low-cap gem categories got an increase in valuation 30 billion in value created just like that okay I remember when the crypto market cap as a whole was less than 30 billion dollars now we're just talking about 30 billion movements yeah yeah a minor movement from week to week uh all right let's talk about um the dollar for a minute because I think it's like a bullish chart yeah this is uh this is a bullish chart I kind of wish this was the Bitcoin or eth chart but it's not this is actually a chart for the dxy this is the dollar relative to a basket of other Fiat currencies primarily this is the Euro yeah the Dixie and the and the Yen and it looks like it is pumping yeah that's happened right there yeah uh so yeah the dollar is just and other currencies of course are going down versus a dollar the British pound have fell off a cliff recently that was a big Topic in the macro world the euro is down to like 96 cents on the dollar uh the dollar everyone wants dollars dollars are in so dollars a time so if you are a dollar holder it's as if your chart is going up uh versus like the rest of the world so congrats to all dollar holders out there you Fiat trash monkeys hey I'm a double holder don't call me a trash monkey don't you have dollars you're a trash monkey too what are you doing I mean but I will say that this is a parabola right uh and so that's unsustainable uh have we topped out on this Parabola I don't know well so that why is the dollar a wrecking ball there's this kind of the the dollar milkshake Theory at play um who's the gentleman behind the dollar milkshake Theory His Name Escapes me at the moment it is a podcast Brett Johnson Brett Johnson's the guy yeah Brett Johnson so this is Brett Johnson basically Theory playing out so markets are down half of it yeah half of it what's the first half the first half is there's demand for the dollar okay the second half is there's the collapse of the demand for the dollar so like if the dollar pumps oh he's ongoing order of operations you mean his his dollar milkshake theory has two parts to it there's a part one the dollar pumps pumps pumps and then there's where it collapses correct yeah there's a the anti-dollar milkshake theory is that the dollar pumps and it doesn't collapse which I actually think is a pretty fair take and when we talk to to Noah uh unreleased podcast no opinion he was like yeah everyone really wants dollars right now uh and so you could see a world where the dollar grows in relative strengths versus all Fiat currencies and then doesn't lose that and it just is the last standing fiat currency like I I think that's a it's what's always interesting is there there doesn't seem to be another fiat currency that is like contending the dollar right now not even close but you're seeing all of liquidity from the other Fiat currencies being being sucked out have you seen those images uh David lately of um hurricane Ian like Tampa Bay we're just like looking at kind of the the coast of Tampa Bay and all of the tide has been sucked out for the hurricane this is like liquidity getting sucked into the dollar that's what's happening right now from other assets as other assets are going down we'll talk about Bonds in a minute this is uh Jim Bianco though talking about the dollar and he says this the U.S economy is about 25 of world GDP all right Americans your economy is 25 of world GDP so you got about a quarter of the GDP but the dollar is 85 of World Trade 85 percent of World Trade is priced in dollars you got a GDP worth about 25 but you have this exorbitant privilege Bianco is talking about of 85 percent of the world trade is priced in dollars you just look at that the dollar is the absolute Champion right now in the fiat currency world and David this is a graph I saw actually on Reddit look at these numbers this is year to date of the dollar and all of the other world currencies falling relative to the dollar you can see the yen in there down 20 percent the pound in there is probably worse by by now but down 20 percent at the time of this recording so the dollar is actually is is uh operating as a wrecking ball and sucking all of the liquidity into it at the same time David the bond market seems to be getting torched the bond market okay these are treasuries and Sovereign bonds this is another tweet from Jim Bianco I think the Bond Market is very big very opaque and very complicated this is why it blows up regularly in GFC 2008 a GFC 2008 the repo 2019 kova 2020 now question mark question mark question mark is that what's happening now what have been the warning signs trouble is brewing Jim goes through some of the tweets above but look at this David this is year to date bond market okay the absolute that line looks different than all other lines this is a scary line okay and this is here today Total return technical analysis it's scary this looks scary to me Bloomberg Global aggregate index all right and we are down in the bond market down about 20 year-to-date look at all of the other like starts of years that that were bad the second worst in 1999 which around this time was down about five percent here we are in the bond market down 20 percent year-to-date so bonds not doing too well I remember when we had Jim Bianco on it was about at that first Mark I believe in the the Blue Line there that first dip around June and my mind was like oh okay it's really really bad it how bad can it get can it really get much worse maybe you got versus here and then it got better and then it got a lot worse uh so this thing has continued this this line has continued to diverge from all other previous lines again some high quality technical analysis not technical analysis and high quality market analysis by bankless lines looking different mines are different lines looking different lines looking bad um lines going down on the bond market well line going up on the strength of the US dollar this is another line this this looks scary here's a great line uh this is the tweet no words and this is depicting the drawdown in total market capitalization of U.S equity and fixed income of course fixed income is primarily in the form of bonds U.S Equity we know what those are that is stocks and look we are down 57.8 trillion on the year-to-date basis and what does that mean can you explain like I'm five this is the total market cap of stocks and fixed income stocks and bonds down 57.8 trillion from their all-time highs wait so 57.8 trillion dollars of wealth is gone in the last like half of a year from all-time high yeah from all-time highs that's a that's a lot from whenever the all-time market cap yeah it's big the crypto total market cap is uh under 1 trillion so we've lost we've lost 58 crypto Industries in 2021 2022. there you go so when you put it that way I don't feel so bad David I cannot doing great uh Mike novogratz makes the comment that this is 3x GDP that's what we're talking about 57.8 trillion dollars is 3x GDP all right so if you have your money in equities and you have your money in bonds which most pensions do you're feeling a wee bit of pain right now like this does not feel good this does not feel uh this does not feel healthy certainly and uh we are actually maybe starting to see signs of Pensions get into hard times pensions going bust question mark I don't know too much about this story how it's developing but this is a headline from The Wall Street Journal UK pensions push into hard to sell assets expose them to a cash squeeze that headline sucks yeah that headline's pretty bad what it means UK pensions push into hard to sell assets that means previously UK pensions bought hard to sell assets and that exposure to them has put them into a cash squeeze Wall Street Journal improve your headlines but basically pensions have a bunch of illiquid assets uh and they can't sell them because of illiquity Crisis get get advice from bankless headlines okay lines going down all right that headlines are terrible break it down so that people understand all right Wall Street Journal uh so that's what's going on and I guess the you know the macro take here is has always been the take as we had sort of that macro Sprint uh back over the summer of just trying to understand what's going on right strengthening dollar bonds getting worse the question is how long will bondholders be holding the bag for uh all of the inflation costs right and so the question in my mind and the question that that Bianco and other macro analysts that we brought on Bank lists have always brought up is how long will the central bank will Jerome Powell continue to tighten and the answer has always been until things start to break all right are these signs of things breaking I mean bondholders cannot be happy at this point in time we have uh UK pensions maybe feeling some pressure in a squeeze are things starting to break are we starting to see early signs of a fracture and yet the FED continues to tighten so this is the question and I almost think David I want to get some more macro voices on on Bank list to answer this question of how far can the FED actually push uh the markets before things break well it seems to be it's breaking in a number of different ways all at once there seems to be a number of things that seem to are on like the precipice of Breaking the Bond Market I guess that pushes the pension plans into bad spots stock market's bad down bad like people are going to start to go and solve it in the stock stock market uh I mean it's now it's a game of like no wait what's going to break first like because there's many different fractures including there's talk of like you know inflation being sort of a lagging indicator and maybe we're actually entering deflationary territory and I mean that could be worrisome because if you tighten too hard too fast and you're only responding to lagging indicators what if you turn the entire economy into worse than a recession into a deflationary depression I think the the idea that we have a ton of inflation because the Fed was too slow to increase interest rates followed by now we have a bunch of deflation because the Fed was too slow to Pivot and reduce interest rates seems like a reasonable future scenario to have that's too simple though they've got to see that right let's not if your power is just like let's not make the same mistake we made by respect the thing you would hope okay all right our our Central Bankers smart or are they dumb I've never been able to answer that question I've never been able to answer that because sometimes I wonder if they if they are smart but they're acting dumb that could be part of it because like that that whole angle really throws a curveball into the whole analysis I think they're actually smart I think they're smart and dumb and sometimes they play dumb I think that's the case and sometimes they're just dealing with the the cards they were dealt sure and like kind of the political um yeah the tools at their disposal as well uh but let's talk about the crypto economy an economy that we understand a little bit more ultrasound on money makes me feel so comfortable I understand everything on this page so do I I understand this page it all makes sense to me it's just like ah I I don't have to worry about like it's all algorithmic the lines on this page look good yes the lines look good all right so we are actually not ultrasound though David right post merge yet um so we looked at this last week just I gotta look at it again this week we have increased supply of eth 8500 eighth worth of Supply however I'm gonna click this button this is a fun button if we didn't merge we would have been how much David you said a hundred and eighty thousand so eight and a half thousand versus a hundred and eighty thousand ether issued uh yeah that's different so eth issuance hanging at about 0.18 that's the annual issuance as of now but that can change quickly and David maybe we go through that in a few tweets uh what's this first tweet we're looking at yeah so this was an interesting take that actually a lot of people in my circles were like oh I didn't think about this uh this tweet says minor payouts artificially increase the gas price now that they're now there are 500 000 less of such regular transactions I think they mean that I don't know what on a time frame that is maybe on a daily time frame um but basically here's how this works um minor pools if you are an independent Miner mining at home or you have just like you're not a massive you're not massive you you generally join a mining pool almost everyone joins the mining pool you just smoothed out your payouts that way you grouped together so that instead of like once a year you receive two eth uh you get a regular payout of like point one eth every every bit of time every time you accrue a balance uh and so I remember doing this when I was um I would mine with a nanopool and and so I would get every time my threshold my like balance would hit point two eth I would get a payout it would go to my wallet and nanopool would pay me out they would mind the block they would get all the rewards and they would pay me for my hash power that's how a mining Pool Works and so all these individual miners are getting paid smaller micro transactions on every on chain as they as miners are paid out and so this was a huge part apparently of ethereum blocks based consumption of just regular ether payments to miners all over the world as they comprise these mining pools so eliminating the proof of work mining also eliminated all of these highly regular micro ether payments to all these miners all across the world and so that's a big reason as to why gas prices have been down so much post merge is because we are no longer paying out like thousands and thousands and thousands of miners all at once all over the world uh people people forgot to consider this so the take here is the merch made ethereum transactions cheap yeah what is the gas price right now David uh 15 quite 15 great Yeah we actually had a huge Spike an hour ago uh actually I think I put that into the weekly well yeah you're about to click on that tweet uh so we had an nft drop I think I believe uh gas price hit a hundred way it was between 60 and 100 way for a good like almost hour or so uh and the cool thing is is that we burned about eight hours worth of ether inside of 40 blocks so like in five to ten minutes we burned eight hours worth of ether issuance uh and like this is a point I've been trying to drive home we could go like a year of inflationary ether and then if another nft Market or nft bowl or D5 season whatever happened we could burn all of that inflated issued ether for the last year inside of two weeks if the gas markets pick up again and so Dom oh shout out to Dom I'm gonna this is gonna be the last time I shout this out because I'm totally gonna take all future credit for this uh Dom in my in my replies uh said uh capped issuance uncapped burn nice job Dom uh capped issuance uncapped burn and so that's a great way of illustrating the monetary system of ether and Dom every time David tries to steal that from you I'm going to remind folks where it came from okay that's yours Dom take that the other interesting thing I saw this week is back onto that ultrasound money supply growth chart you can actually flip back to the actual website you can see the days of the week in The Ether issuance and so you see in the left hand of that that curve that that waviness where like you know the mornings people wake up and they you know do some transactions and then in the weekends ether gets issued because like gas markets are depressed is depressed this week this week was almost an ultrasound week like that it looks like it's capped over the last like five or six days so there hasn't been much issuance over the last five or six days and it's the difference between the weekends where the wavy Parts where you get the congestion the rush hour if you will of ethereum versus uh the weekdays excuse me the weekdays are where you get the Rush Hour the weekends or where you get the supply growth wait wait you say on ethereum we're bankless yet we're keeping Banker hours like we don't do gas transactions the society organizes around human economic activity uh and so like yeah like take holidays off exactly the Express expressways on highways go point in certain directions based on user Demand right and so I just think it's cool that ethereum is such a finely tuned machine that you can see the days of the week on the supply growth chart which I think is illustrative of a great system a great system absolutely great system uh really cool um David let's talk about one of the other pieces of meta we think might exist during this bear Market season that we're in and that is an emphasis on protocol profitability love it this was a really good dashboard put together by the folks at token terminal and it shows the earnings of all sorts of different defy and layer 1 protocols I think actually only ethereum the ethereum is the only layer one here I haven't been able to see the others but you can actually look at this on a 24-hour day time Horizon a seven day time Horizon 30 all the way out to kind of Max and see let's look over the last week ethereum earned negative five million dollars negative five million dollars it's not profitable but that was a lot worse previously when it was issuing so much so the way you get profits of course is like what are the revenue what what's the revenue of a blockchain blockchain spell sell blocks as we've said so many times so the revenue is uh burnt eth essentially and um and fees as a result of a payment for blocks uh and the cost is the issuance itself and so the earnings over the long run of Youth look real bad negative 21 billion dollars in eth issuance that went to minors this is why miners are so toxic sorry to cut you off but this is 21.7 billion dollars that got handed to minors so miners are not all that money they got all that money it was very expensive that's what we would say it was like a combustion engine relative to a new engine that gets far far more yeah electric uh and so we have other D5 protocols as well and you can look the last seven days openc made two million in earnings dydx we've got metamask here we've got magic Eden here Lido Finance what do you make of this dashboard and earnings in General David so the the first thing I'm noticing on the on the right side the earnings is like there's a lot of red uh ethereum negative 343 million dollars over the last 30 days that's because a lot of the last 30 days have proof of work issuance but uniswap negative 302 dollars I mean 302 whatever openc made 904 million dollars that's why it's a good business Lido negative 5.9 convex Finance negative 2.8 of a negative 72 000 so not that not that much GMX negative 3.4 dydx negative 3.8 million lots of negatives lots of negatives they're all red uh the next era of crypto and crypto is going to die if these things don't flip green they have to flip green at some point in time and I think we're going to this I think this is going to be the crescendo of the next bull market is that slowly one of these one of these orgs figures out there issuance their costs their revenues and it flips green and then the next one flips green and then the next one flip screen and this is going to trigger the next bull market is that these things all start to flip green and their earnings outweigh their costs we already have a decent number of things that have flipped green openc metamask there's centralized companies so they don't have like protocol issuance but maker Dow green Perpetual protocol green one inch green arbitrum green magic Eden Green but then if you keep on scrolling down it's just like red red red red red token issuance yield farming like Dow payments yields incentives blah blah blah make it green if you're if you're part of the Dow that's red go into your Dow and start making it green so we can have our bull market back that's what you need to do go find profit I think there's some gems here too to to be looking at from an investment perspective is investing in profitable protocols might be some Alpha uh David Alpha could you imagine yeah can you imagine a protocol a crypto critical that actually makes money uh David we get a lot coming up next number one the cftc is attacking Dallas next is that did our good regulator just turned bad did they go the way of the SEC and also we're going to talk more about the nft industry how it's exploding inactivity guys we'll be right back with the rest of the roll up but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible Juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your checking account with Juno you can send money

ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but crypto killer apps need ZK sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge

a future proof Foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zksync's website at zksync.i out and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on Twitter too at zksync the cftc charges Okie Dao for an illegal offering of off-chain digital asset trading registration violations and failing to comply with the bank secrecy act all normal things to charge something for if they did all that stuff but they charged a dow and they're going after token holders which is very new and very different and puts forth an interesting premise that the cftc will actually have to prove in court that Dow token holders did these things but that is exactly what the cftc is going to try and do apparently they are trying to sue a Dell how that is going to work will be interesting I was pretty stunned by this last week when I saw these tweets pretty disappointed this is the filing itself and so the cftc which is the commodity Futures Trading Commission of course they regulate Commodities in the US um and they're I guess uh their brother organization is the SEC which regulates Securities they just issued an order and a filing to charge b0x bzx also also also known as okidal it's one of the same thing I guess they rebranded and so they are charging the founders Tom bean and Kyle kistner for illegally offering leveraged and margin retail commodity transactions and digital assets engaging in activities only registered Futures cftc Merchants can perform and failing to adopt a customer identification program as part of the bank secrecy act compliance program so these are the charges laid that in itself is is somewhat surprising I'm not sure exactly what b0x was into and up to and the most surprising part about it was not the charges but who the charges are laid against this is a tweet from carlo.eth yesterday the cftc filed a declaration in forming the court that it seeks to essentially charge every voting member of Oki Dao via its chat bot and form posts so the cftc filed a lawsuit against members of the Dow itself this is a stunning new development for the space because if approved by the court it will create legal precedent allowing Regulators to claim proof of service of a legal action against every member of The decentralized Entity every member of the Dao via notice to its website the cftc claims that it got confirmation that members were served by monitoring the chat posts between down members it remains to be seen how the Dow members will mobilize and fight and respond stay tuned for more so the cftc was actually monitoring chat posts between Dow members and they are not only charging the founders of this protocol they are charging individuals inside of the dial particularly those individuals who voted in governance of this protocol that to me David is absolutely stunning and it is completely unclear that they have jurisdiction over this this is really a regulation by enforcement type of move by the cftc what's interesting here David is as you were alluding to early earlier the cftc has traditionally been kind of crypto forward crypto friendly curiously Innovative well it seemed like the SEC to date has been much more aggressive um you know late like a much more aggressive and hostile and unclear take on the crypto industry writ large we haven't previously seen that from the cftc and so this is a kind of a stunning move and I was very surprised to see it yeah this is this is going to take a while to unpack there's a lot of things to to think about here there I'll always stand by what I say which is if it can be regulated then it should be regulated and so it's interesting to watch the attempt of the cftc to regulate a dow um just because something is a dow doesn't mean it's has immunity right and so if the Dow is doing illegal stuff and those members of that Dao are like kyc'd and identified and known to the cftc that gives the cftc kind of the surface area they need to go after the bzx entity like the Dow itself if they're going after the individual members so they're not like taking the bzx like LLC to court because that's not an entity that's what a Dao is but they are taking individual members in leadership of the Dao and going after them which kind of effectively is the same thing kind of even scarier if there's no limited liability Corporation protecting these individuals uh all I see here Ryan is like there's probably members of the Dow that are Anonymous the cftc can't go after because they don't know who they are all this is doing is promoting and incentivizing anonymity uh which is probably bad I think it's pushing an anonymity it's also pushing uh defy Innovation outside of the borders of the US because why would you do this as a US citizen this is Jake travinsky's take the cftc's bzx enforcement action may be the most egregious example of Regulation by enforcement in the history of crypto we've complained at length about the SEC abusing this tactic but the cftc has put them to shame wow strong words coming from Jake he continues it's deeply disappointing to see the cftc damage its own reputation like this among those who care about the future of crypto in the United States especially at a critical moment while it pitches itself to Congress as the right agency to regulate digital commodity trades this is kind of like uh you know the Obi-Wan and Anakin meme of like you were the chosen one yeah and uh the it's the cftc it's previously almost promoted itself to Congress and legislators as the group that could both support the regulatory Ambitions of the U.S but also Foster Innovation for crypto and uh feels like we're almost trading one devil for the other if this is the kind of action they're going to take against the crypto industry um but here's a bright side David I want you to read this tweet from uh WC hughes.eth sure he says a court has to agree with the cftc for these theories about Dao liability for token to be meaningful basically if you own the token are you a dow member Dow leader Dao executor the bill continues and says that's not going to be an easy fight for the cftc chill out everyone the world hasn't ended so this is opening a door but there's still so much left to unpack what what is behind this door so this is going to be an ongoing saga it's another example of uh this all gets settled in courts I guess we're seeing more of more of that um there's also a silver line settled in courts right there's also a silver lining that there was a commissioner summer mercinger who dissented and Hester purse style she wrote an entire descent on the cftc's action of course she is a commissioner so she is a representative of the cftc but uh why don't you read her statement here David is basically under the the headline it didn't have to be this way and she's talking to her own organization by saying that it didn't have to be this way what did she say yeah basically she says one one small paragraph in the longer dissenting statement says unfortunately I cannot support the commission's approach to this particular matter well I do not condone individuals or entities blatantly violating the cea or our rules we cannot arbitrarily decide who is accountable for these violations based on an unsupported legal Theory amounting to regulation by enforcement while federal and state policy is developing for these Reasons I'm respectfully dissenting in this matter um thank you summer thank you appreciate it uh I I this was surprising out of the cftc like we said like cftc has always been like the good guy in stark contrast to the csec so I'm kind of hoping this is a little bit of like not a mistake but just like since it's out of character the cftc has like more like we know Gary Ganser is coming after us this could be an anomaly out of the cftc and that is like perhaps my fingers crossed Silver Lining this this is an anomaly I think that's a good take and that's a hopeful take I also wonder I have another take on this and this might be a more pessimistic take on it and that is that the cftc is is getting drained of its crypto friendly Advocates so Brian quintens left the cftc he was formerly uh you know a commissioner in the cftc now now works in crypto he now works in crypto we've also had Christian Carlo who's the former head of the cftc on the podcast uh which is very crypto friendly he kind of consults and works in crypto and so I wonder if um the only Regulators that are left standing or soon to be left standing will be crypto unfriendly Regulators because those that have kind of caught the crypto bug and see the vision for this thing are just like I don't want to stick around this age I don't want to miss the boat it's Prosecuting crypto I'm going to get into so I I wonder if that's partially what's happening as well this is of course just Ryan's speculation but that would be a more pessimistic reading of going on I can definitely see that take that it seemed like a very reasonable take which is extremely bearish it's kind of like crypto is so bullish and such a magnet for talent that it takes all the people that see it away from the regulation Regulators where we need them to be well if there's this warped view I think among Regulators too do you remember when they were talking about like preparing the White House reports right uh on crypto and anyone who owned crypto assets actually had to recuse themselves right from that right and so it's like that meets all of the people who actually understand crypto like all of the crypto books if you understand crypto you're probably going to want to own some crypto right I mean by Nature the way it works that's kind of the way it works but now everyone who understands crypto holds crypto has to now recuse themselves in the process I mean it's almost to me it's just like asking everyone who holds dollars to like recuse themselves from some sort of legislation impacting dollars like it's just you're going to eliminate everyone that kind of understands how the dollar system works anyway that might be what we're up against but let's move on to some more optimistic takes David nfts are back baby what's going on with fidenzas you remember the name Tyler Hobbs Ryan Tyler Hobbs the creator of fidenzas I don't remember him but I do remember fidenza certainly yeah so he the creative credenzas coming out with his second generative art collection uh 900 new nfts uh and he just finished a sale of at 14 e each so he raised raised Revenue made money of 12 600 ether inside of the sale 17.6 million dollars in a bear market and Ryan they are beautiful they are beautiful nfts uh if you are into this game of general advice oh that one is great they're looking like kind of like patterned embroidery like seashell art kind of thing for the the podcast listeners out there but there is some new mechanisms at play here and so this isn't just another art blocks drop that somehow did very very well this is a brand new style of drop where there was a something called like a strike price where you could bid how much ether you're willing to pay for an nft and then there would be one price selected after the fact and everyone would pay that same price and if you over bid you got some of your ether back so that was a cool mechanism and then also you get to admit your own nft so the people that bought what these things are they actually bought a mint pass not the actual nft themselves and so minting will start soon but you if you have a mint pass you can go into like this kind of create your own build an nft algorithm Workshop so the mentor and the artist and the algorithm are all having like this three-way relationship uh and so if you as a mint pass owner you can start to Tinker with some dials and make your nft look A particular way and then you get to Mint it which is kind of cool but overall I think the big takeaway is that Tyler Hobbs creator of cadenzas had an absolutely massively successful nft drop with his qql art drop that's what it's called qql raising 17.6 million dollars in the middle of an era where people thought that our blocks specifically our blocks were dead that's really impressive I would not have guessed it not in this economy David how about Christie's they're doing something with nfts yeah Christie's uh Chrissy's uh they were the place the the auction house that sold the people art for 6 69 million dollars remember that Ryan yes this is awesome like we're just recapping the bull market right now Christies announced the first ever Global auction house to host fully on-chain sales on ethereum so according to Chrissy's all transactions on this new platform including an uh app including after an auction will be recorded on ethereum and all requisite transactions and compliance tools also integrated streamlining the process that it was at times a strange hybrid of crypto Tech and 20th Century bureaucracy in the early days of the nft Boom the launch of Chrissy's 3.0 can be seen I'm reading from the announcement here the launch of Chris D's 3.0 can be seen as a direct result of the beeple sale in which Christie's accepted cryptocurrency ether and allowed buyers to transfer the crypto to the auction house directly from their digital wallets that sale was orchestrated in part by Christy specialist Noah Davis who subsequently left this firm to go work for Yuga Labs now pioneering the crypto punks and then also from the Christie's website here's where it gets really really cool uh straight on the the website it's what is Chrissy's 3.0 Christie's 3.0 is an on-chain auction platform dedicated to exceptional nft art whether you're new to nfts or already a committed member of the community discover and bid on exclusive drops curated by Christie's and then there's the Q the the question like how do I buy to bid on Chrissy's 3.0 auctions you need to connect a digital wallet for the best experience we recommend connecting via a desktop browser using a browser extension such as a metamask or coinbase after can after you connected your wall up you can then set up a Christie's 3.0 account if you're already a Chrissy's client you'll be able to bid without further identity verification if you're a new user it will ask you to verify your identity once verified you are good to go so metamask coinbase integration into Chris Keys add some k YC and boom you are you are making bids on the Christie's virtual metaverse Auction House wow that's pretty cool and also the website looks fantastic this is just like like right in the art world right Chrissy says probably at the center of the Art Auction House world and they're basically pivoting and they're saying stake in the ground our new auction house all of our resources are going to be in crypto based on ethereum look at this question from that thank yous David what currencies can I use on Christie's 3.0 Christie's 3.0 accepts ethereum eth that's it right this is like nfts being denominated in ether once again and blows my mind if if we didn't just live through a crazy nft bull market and you had told me two years ago that there would be such a website and this would be in the Christie's FAQ uh I would have been over the moon excited about the adoption and because I think this is happening during a bear Market no one really notices right life goes on so Ryan this to me here's the most bullish scenario for this the normal Christie's business continues to go on the regular Fiat like paintings physical paintings you know analog art that's still going to go on but there's also infrastructure for normal analog art to receive a digital correlate a digital like version of itself and the reason why this is so bullish for Chrissy is like this auction house is Because The Internet Is global right you have more Market Market participants because they don't have to leave their own home they use internet rails like ethereum to get money into Christie's who can participate in this and Chrissy's 3.0 versus the actual physical chrissies is an order like orders of magnitude the scale of the internet right and so you can totally and easily see analog art starting to be auctioned off on Chrissy's 3.0 because of the global liquidity of ether and accessibility and so I think you know this is going to start as normal nfts as we know them but it's going to also start to bleed into like regular Boomer analog art also auctioned off on this platform and eventually the Art Market the physical Art Market is just going to be consumed by the digital art Market because that's how the that's how technology Works software eats everything yeah totally agree guys more hot nft news coming up next this has been nft week nft bow week uh Disney's doubling down on nfts and so they've just revealed some big things we're going to talk about also Apple wants a ginormous cut of all nft sales what are they talking about Tim Cook what are you doing we'll talk about that there's so much activity guys we'll be right back but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible rocketpool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your East with rocketpool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your ease and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by taking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating notes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16eath to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking Commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if your bullish is staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your known to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pole community in their Discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so I'll see you there lens protocol is an open source Tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps Bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create so in order to get started there is a secret code word in the show notes enter that code word in the Google form links and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3 social Disney is revealing some of its intentions with a job listing because they are looking to hire a principal Council specializing in nfts the metaverse blockchain technology and decentralized finance to guide the company through what appears to be its coming and aggressive push into web 3. so there's a job posting for this position explaining that this uh the attorney the the name of this position will provide legal advice and support for Global nft products made in collaboration with Disney media and entertainment distribution as well as Disney Parks experience and products Ryan to me that sounds like the full thing that sounds like that's just a whole the level of Disney Marvel Disney the princesses it's all of it and additionally the announcement continues or the article continues the principal Council will provide day-to-day legal advice to Disney legal and business teams on nft and cryptocurrency related matters and issues and provide thought leadership and strategic Direction on products involving digital currency and blockchain Technology wow that doesn't sound like a hey who's some Zoom or Millennial kid who knows about nfts this sounds like hey who is uh an operator who's done some awesome bang up job in the web 2 space that is all super knowledgeable about nfts and wants to lead the entire Disney Company into this nft thing so this is going to be a huge hire congratulations ahead of time to whoever lands this job it's going to be some Chad uh probably and wow uh I mean what I mean think about the surface area between Disney and nfts it's got to be infinite yeah I think one thing you know we've been talking so much about like building the the through the bear market right and when I think of Builders I think of like just all of the D5 builders that we've had on the podcast you know the Hayden Adams and the you know the Stanis and the Kane warwicks and all of these people of course but this season of the bear Market it's actually companies it's actually corporations that were like huh that nft thing was incredible and we know it's not over and so and we just saw Christie's uh open up their auction house in the bear market now we're seeing Disney doubling down and hiring a strategic position to guide all of their Global nft efforts during the bear market right these companies are building during the bear Market as well and I think we'll uh we'll see the fruits of that on the other side when things get frothy again Ryan I remember your take that nfts are less threatening to the web to traditional world than Defy is to the banks defy disrupts the banks nfts enhances the rest of the world uh and I think we're definitely seeing that take play out uh and now as a D5 Pro I'm like damn those nft people are having a lot of fun well it's all right you're an nft bro too if you wanted me sure yeah what's this the Patriots nfts Yeah the New England Patriots for the international listeners that's a football team team uh sorry an American football team yes uh headline reads well no not soccer yes not soccer so it's not soccer yes nft software company chain inc's four-year deal with the New England Patriots a deal with craft Group which I'm not familiar with who makes chain the official blockchain and web 3 sponsor of the Patriots the New England Revolution Gillette Stadium and Patriot Place so the Patriots football team has a official blockchain and web 3 sponsorship in the craft group what's your favorite uh player on the Patriots huh uh is Tom Brady on the Patriots I'm gonna say yes because I have no idea well first off he's definitely not my favorite player is Tom Brady it's just the only one that David who knows Tom huge football fans on bankless uh he plays for oh he's now on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers what the hell did that damn we're gonna get we're about to get destroyed in the car we are oh we are going to get absolutely should we hang on can I make sure that he was actually on the Patriots so it better have been or we're definitely cutting this this is not making a show for this wrong uh yeah it was a Patriots it was a Patriots knew it yes all right we just don't keep up with football all the time since crypto that's that that's all it is you want you want to hear a fun fact around about football yeah I played on my High School's football team you did yeah good position wide receiver and kicker wow like was it fun were you good like no oh I was a good kicker I was super good kicker um I was called I was called kicker that's what they called me that was my name on the team they called me kicker it wasn't endearing let me tell you kicker get the water for us that's awesome uh David punks are still hot too more nft bullishness a crypto Punk 2924 AKA an ape hoodie Punk uh if you're in the punk world you know both apes are extremely rare and a hoodie is a well sought after property was sold for 4.4 million dollars um casual casual uh crypto Punk sale I will say like when I bought my crypto monk uh it was like all right I'm not that much of an nft bro but I want to have exposure so I'll just buy this crypto Punk because it feels safe it feels like buying Bitcoin after its second bubble which is way safer than buying after its first bubble because you don't believe it's ever going to come back so yeah now crypto punks have the Lindy effect uh and so I can't wait for the third bubble of crypto well I bet you're happy like this is the kind of headline straight from the the bull market it almost feels like an anachronism it's almost like completely out of place here right yeah except that 3 300 eighth in the bull market would have been like 20 million dollars not 4.4 million dollars that is true there's still a lot of eth right and if you're buying for each denominated returns like crypto punks haven't gone down that bad and there's a denominated terms there's a small chance that that 3300 ether sale was also simultaneously a tax loss harvesting event for the buyer okay so this might not be as bullish as it appears no I'm kidding by the way I love that you have no idea who what team Tom Brady uh plays for but you can tell me about 100 crypto Punk and why it's valuable oh my God uh what about this is this another oh yeah I saw this tweet yeah so uh Pablo piconso.eth Great Name by the way retweets the sale of this crypto Punk and says five years ago I sold this crypto Punk for fourteen hundred dollars ouch wow no I mean sorry okay then he's got a crypto punk in his profile he's got a great punk in his profile yeah uh but like remember uh you can't really hate on when you sell something five years ago plus you don't know uh you can't hate on it but Pablo that's a fun fact um yeah just I hope you feel good about it everyone has mistakes in crypto bury those mistakes deep down never think about them that's my strategy for coping all the things I've missed David how many things have you missed oh my god I've missed so many things I've missed I've missed zero things there's not a single thing that I've had well uh bring that Alpha to me man because I've missed a lot over the years but you didn't miss this on Instagram this is from your Instagram I think this is a recording what are we looking at yeah this is one of my friends who uh this is the first time I saw this uh a the we reported on nfts on Instagram a while ago but it was with very select artists uh and so this was the first nft that I've seen in my own person in the Instagram feed in the wild yeah uh and so uh it's nice because uh it's a cool cat so we're looking at a cool cat here but you know it's an nft because these nfts and Instagram have a little shine to them they like they kind of like shine they gloss over a little bit Yeah is this the gradient you're talking about is that the shot well you need to play it because this is a video so you need to play it but here there it is oh I see a little Shrine yeah a little glimmer yeah only nfts get that only nfts get that yes exactly that's right uh this is a screen cap recording so we can't do this but there's a little digital collectible tab in the bottom left of the nft and if you tap on that it tells you what ethereum address owns it it's on ethereum yeah yeah and who owns it yeah this is still like um I think beta launched so it's not available to everyone because it's available to everyone yeah so I was I was going to screen record record my profile of like you can go down into okay so here's how you do this everyone pull out your Instagram and follow along uh if you have an Instagram you go and you go to your profile the bottom in the bottom right and then you hit the menu yeah I'm doing it on my phone so the listeners and viewers can follow along uh your profile and then the top right the drop down menu the menu button and there is a digital Collectibles I see it oh my God it is it is rolled out to absolutely everyone uh share digital Collectibles with uh followers and fans connect to digital wallet so I click get started I hit to tap get started connect oh my God uh coins yeah what how awesome dude what this is bear Market stuff man that's right I was just saying corporations are building this is meta what how many billions of users they have like two point something all of them yeah they have almost all of the humans at this point in time I'm literally connecting my metamask and uh you see this Panda behind me yeah oh you have it on metamask I was going to do this with my crypto Punk but my crypto Punk is not on a hot wallet here's the thing I'm super private with my Instagram like I have it locked down yes you don't even have me on there I don't yeah I don't I've noticed it's super it's super locked down um because it's always mine that's why I didn't put up uh that's why I didn't put up my own Instagram account don't follow me and don't follow me I delete it I have less than 500 followers because I delete everyone well when are you gonna change that though now now you could be an nft influencer on Instagram nope not gonna happen nope it's Twitter only Twitter is for like business is crypto Instagram is for friends that's just my life that's the way my Instagram is specifically for people I have met in real life yeah yeah and like the last time I talked about this on Bank list I got roughly like 300 follows on my Instagram accounts like you guys didn't  listen scari no no no no no no this is this is the thing with crypto you tell people not to do the thing and then it makes them more bullish about doing the thing don't buy my token don't don't buy my token it works every time but you know what's crazy about this meanwhile so we've got one Tech Giant which is adding nfts to their social media profile meanwhile Apple wants to charge a 30 cut on all nft sales shocker if there's an app like say openc for example I'm imagining uh that you download from the Apple um store you put that app on your iPhone they want 30 percent of all of those sales like that just doesn't work in crypto what are you guys talking about can't do it the fact that this was even the open C charges 2.5 luxury charge is two percent like how does how did we ever become okay with 30 how are we ever okay with your take rate is my opportunity right that's the whole thing around cryptos like these margins these 30 margins can't last not in web 3 we'll just bypass Apple um somehow I suppose the Solana well the Solana phone that's what this was for I guess I don't really know a viable way aside from using the open internet right rather than app stores to kind of bypass these sorts of fees but um this can't continue but Apple thinks it can they think they've got a monopoly on the web 3 nft space 30 well fine they're just gonna they're gonna Foster more and more Innovation faster so have you have you been following uh epic like epic games you know the creators of fortnite installing it this is uh well Tim Sweeney has been taking shots at Apple for a long time there's been some beef between epic I remember I remember yeah this is Tim Sweeney tweet about this 30 nft charge now apple is killing all nft app businesses that can't tax crushing another nascent technology that could rival its grotesquely overpriced in-app payment service Apple must be stopped Tim Sweeney says Apple Must Be Stopped spicy spicy it's hard you talk bad about apple right and what do they do do you list your app do you platform you bad to get deep platform from Apple yeah you don't want that yeah it's another uh another web 2 company we have to Route Around in order to make this uh make this work make this happen meanwhile David what is the Fed doing with their Central Bank digital currency I love how the block this is the block that tweeted this out they added breaking breaking the FED has decided to not proceed with a digital dollar says Powell a break which was not exactly breaking news this has been the meme that we have been laughing about on Bank list the entire time Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says he will not push forward with a U.S Central Bank digital currency uh the in the coming years he says the coming years are focused on research and building public confidence in cbdc's which is the same thing that they said last year which is the same thing that they said it's so funny the year before meanwhile they're kind of keeps building yeah exactly I mean but also they don't even know this yet but they should be saying thank God for usdc because that is the cbdc this is this is the take I think which is then if they're deciding not to do a central bank digital currency then de facto they're adopting a erc20 stable coin they're adopting a usdc and something that's been Bank regulated and they're turning it over to the private sector because the private that's great ain't gonna stop so it's all fine with me but um I think that's what their de facto doing is the US will not have a cdbc anytime soon or it's cdbc will effectively be usdc and we should start thinking about it in those terms um David Cosmos is revamping its Cosmos Hub and the atom token economics I haven't read this full paper but I do know we are having the cosmos folks on the podcast recording tomorrow I think that episode's going to come out in a couple of weeks or so uh so I don't know the details here but I'm actually pretty excited about what the cosmos ecosystem has been building lately do you have any takes here yeah we're recording with sunny and Zaki from the cosmos ecosystem and I talked to Sunny at ECC and he gave me the line that the ethereum and Cosmos Visions converge upon the same end game and so where ethereum it has really prioritized uh security and you know know in the community has emphasized ultrasound money the cool thing about ethereum and one of the big reasons why I think ethereum has done so much better as an ecosystem than Cosmos is because we had ether to focus on as like an intentional focal point and Cosmos never really had that because they focus on app chains and so we as a as a layer 2 ecosystem on ethereum are now focusing on like layer threes which are like the equivalent of app chains and Cosmos but Cosmos has already figured out the app chain they figure that out forever ago so so ethereum is playing catch-up on the app chain world where Cosmos is now playing catch-up on the monetary Properties or an atom token shared security model yeah and so uh really going to be an interesting podcast I'm really looking forward to that uh I don't know much about the economics I'm gonna have to dive into this before we do the podcast Adam stay tuned of atoms yeah yeah super inflationary it's never meant to be money it's very interesting I was an old um Cosmo Staker from way back yeah I want to talk to him a little bit about that but a lot of building going on the space and these new economics look interesting I will say that I judge a lot of protocols by their names and ethereum and ether oh my God it's such a good name Cosmos and Adam can definitely give ethereum a run for its money do you like that great I love the names I love the names it's Cosmos and the atoms or Atomic units is this yeah sure yeah yeah it's kind of cool um all right here was something that happened over the weekend talk of reversible transactions imagine an erc20 transaction David that you could reverse after the fact but I thought blockchains were for immutability uh not the case this is the case by cali.eath billions and crypto stolen if we can't stop the thefts can we reduce the harmful effects over recent months a couple of other Stanford researchers in ninth Stanford as in the University Nigeria and prototype ERC 20R slash 721r to support reversible transactions on ethereum so an nft standard and an erc20 tokens standard that supports reversibility of transactions there was a lot of I guess back and forth about this because there's a camp that says like immutability is part of crypto what are you guys talking about bringing reversibility into our ecosystem like immutability is the whole point and there was another tick that said hey this is just an option use it or don't use it you can do either where do you fall on this spectrum I I initially was compelled by like you know this is open to our software Turing complete we can write whatever code that we want this is just another tool and a massive tool belt of what we want to do with stuff so I was initially in the option like sure like whatever like people might use this they might not I don't really I would never see a reversible transaction being a token being collateral inside of like Ave or or compound or something because you need settlement assurances but then I've thought about it more and more and more and Eric Connor helped convince me is that it's just like a trojan horse for so many bad things and a reversible transaction belongs in the center centralized layer of things put reversible transactions where there are Central authorities to arbitrate reversibility requires arbitration arbitration requires centralization and so it doesn't make any sense in the middle it requires humans so reversibility doesn't should not be at the bare metal right uh and so I'm sure anyone can build this anyone can use it I don't support it uh but you would be upset if all the tokens from here on out adopted it for example oh my God that would make it C5 that would make that would break the whole entire point of ethereum right that would be terrible right yeah that's bad yeah so I I get the duality of these takes like it's to me it's fine to have as an option but I don't want it to be the de facto option on ethereum certainly we'd have a problem if that was the case uh interesting standard though David what's going on with Zack xbt yeah Zach xbt he is this famous uh what would you call him investigator I guess I'm a detective almost like a private yeah yeah but vigilante he works for himself right he's not hired exactly yeah I would put him shoulder to shoulder with Sam's son Sam's son is a white hacker so when there is an exploit that needs to be patched Sams he's on his first Zach is not he doesn't do that but he like discloses people that aren't disclosing their things uh he's the guy he's the guy that um he finds out all the dirty little secrets on Jack that people don't want you to see he's the guy that revealed zero X Seafood to be the quadranga CX uh uh Gerald Patton or John Patton that guy so Zach bxbt is renowned for showing who is pumping and dumping what uh and so larka Davis the crypto Lark uh is the next person to have been found out as a pumper and dumper and who is the crypto Arc just kind of an influencer right he's been around since 2017. I remember listening to his YouTube videos in 2017. uh he's kind of this just like like un uh intimidating white crypto YouTuber dude uh who has just a big following and turns out friendly friendly looking face yeah uh and turns out he has more or less explicitly been like pumping and dumping on his followers uh so you know I was another Another One Bites the Dust I think 29 really or 2020. yeah he invited me to the show I didn't know him very well and he was just like come on and talk about ethereum you seem to know a lot about it so I went in and I talked about my bags David ether yeah yeah ether and I dumped them on Mark's followers you sell ether I don't sell ether actually I mean very infrequently I'm I'm a fine collector of ether of ether yeah see I think okay it's it's tough and this is one of the when I talk about the Genesis story of bankless Ryan I say like hey the crypto media world was starved for a trustworthy media institution that's business model the bar was extremely low media institution that instead of dumping on followers has ads so for all the people that hate on the ads like pick your battles yes uh we don't I I do think so um I mean you can go through all of the the details of what Zac xbtc uh uncovered but it's basically like low cap tokens pump them up um show them your followers and then dump make millions of dollars yeah right this is uh a certain breed of crypto influencers a business model it is not the bankless business business model I mean we get we get paid through uh premium subscribers and also through advertisers not by dumping on you and we're also long-term investors and I also kind of suck at low cap uh coins and like dumpage anyway but one thing I will say is I think um the entire crypto industry and particularly crypto media entities like us have to do a lot better when it comes to disclosures and transparency for sure on the back of some of this stuff from Zack xbt we've had internal meetings about okay how can we like increa rapidly how can we drastically increase the transparency of anyone who works on content within Bank lists and kind of what they're holding so we're actually looking to uh to roll out a new page with all of kind of the stats and all of our holding all of our Angel Investments everything we have uh starting the beginning of next month so we'll be including that in the link in the YouTube show notes and the podcast show notes for all of our listeners and I think there are other organizations that do this well but we also want to like um you know carry the flag and because we recognize that it's a problem in the space and if you're asking why haven't we done this sooner we have we do have a page that is like this but we haven't had a website uh so when Ryan says we're rolling out a a site we're actually rolling out an entire website as well unrelated did and and because of that website we have like a landing page for disclosures yeah we've had we've had our like disclosures out for a while it's just they're not easy to find and easy to get to not as much detail as we now have like look at this detail so it is all getting blown up glowed up uh we list our wallets our public walls yes not not our dumping wall particularly Dave don't even joke man sorry don't even hey Zach xbt I mean come on he would find me out in a heartbeat I'm too fearful of Zach now that tornado cash is gone I can't [Laughter] that guy is still there it's just you're not allowed to use it um this is cool in releases this week Robinhood selects polygon to launch its web 3 wallet beta do you remember when Vlad the CEO of Robin Hood we had that conversation with him at a permissionless I believe and he told us this was coming here it is now it's based on polygon which is pretty cool and you know Robin Hood has great ux uh wallets right so like he was talking about the haptic response do you remember this yeah I remember that it's like response when you press a button you just feel kind of a vibration yeah bounces back into you um gives you nice pleasure Sensations I don't know what this is but it does something to the endorphins uh anyway I'm looking for a really cool ux uh wallet Dave and I are hoping to get on the the beta program so we can test this out for you guys too and tell you what we think yeah uh there was always a large amount number of questions as to how Robin Hood plans on releasing some of their promises like gas-free trading Etc so we're starting to get some clarity on that so yeah that's good cool safe tokens and safe down are here this is safe from gnosis safe if you have a multi-cig or had a multi-tig or operated a multi-sig you might have gotten an airdrop there's a link in the show notes to go check that out to see if you got some tokens uh I think we got a Clemson tokens David that's something we do have to claim some tokens we have a gnosis uh safe don't we yeah also coming out of open C excited to share that optimism is currently live on openc really actually I think openc is live on optimism since optimism is the actual platform but semantics uh yeah uh so openc and optimism now working together so that's pretty cool tailwagging the dog there uh sound critical what is this sound protocol sound.xyz AKA music nfts uh is now they are announcing the sound protocol permissionless base layer artist owned and non-upgradable song contracts per permanent and decentralized metadata custom mint formats and payments with end-to-end royalties uh Cooper turley's music nft thesis slowly but surely playing out are you a sound nft pill the yet David a little bit I I am music nft pilt yeah music nft build I am music and empty build it could be any sound though yeah I mean when bankless intro music nft uh this is cool Circle expands usdc stable coins to support five new blockchains so Circle getting usdc everywhere on Cosmos near optimism and polka dot this time around and arbitrim oh cool and they just announced that at their converge 22 conference which of course we've been talking about for a while that that conference David let's get to raises uscc is not on arbitrum yes it is um it definitely is what does that mean I don't know what that is I literally own usdc I've owned usdc on Arbitrage I hope it's the right uscc David oh go no well um maybe they're doubling down on their support maybe it's a different arbitrary Network right like you know one of the term Nova yeah Nova or something like this yeah uh what's going on in the world of raises raises coinbase Ventures backed crypto firewall provider harpy heartbeat 4.5 million dollar raise uh cool there we go uh Pantera our friend uh Dan from Pantera is launching a new fund potentially at 1.25 billion dollar fund couldn't resist these bear market prices you gotta deploy some more Capital so that's what Pantera looks to be about to do David FDX and CZ from binance they're both bidding for Voyager guess who won guess who won a place for best friend now if you are listening to the podcast not viewing it place your bets here it goes here he goes Sam bankman freed one yep 1.4 billion dollar bid SBF wins uh kind of make that sense like the yeah I feel like that was The Logical one so sorry do you know um SPF is kind of like the the more I was gonna say Morgan Freeman no not that Morgan Freeman the JP Morgan of the era and buying up all of these kind of underwater Banks and coming out stronger on the other side I think both CZ and SBF are going to be an absolute force to be reckoned with on the other side of this bear Market uh by the way the Celsius token just jumped as SBF said he is maybe eyeing buying Celsius next as part of his buying spree so celsi's token owner is excited about that not much to be excited about if you're a Celsius token owner but I guess uh that little one I don't know why that that's bullish to begin with I I don't know that it is either I guess you know some bailout was bullish uh what else we got because because Celsius token holders there are no rights so like Sam could be like well we're buying Celsius I don't give a crap about the cell token holders because they have no investor rights like ignore them David give them something be excited about okay they've had a pretty hard year I think if you're a Celsius token owner are you a Celsius token holder um I had I still have funds in Celsius and I think they were giving me Celsius tokens too but that's the least of my concerns right now I want my youth back Alan now you have to ask us yeah I have to ask Sam for your reason well um well I I we've had Sam on the podcast so maybe I can it's not his problem though it's just he's he's gonna buy the assets he's going to discard all the liabilities it's going to be a bankruptcy Court's problem Alex machinski resigned this week by the way I can't believe he was still in charge but yeah he resigned from uh Celsius so I just finished a uh so remember remember my voted my bulletron last week uh Ryan it was the bankless YouTube like short form 8 to 20 minute long videos I just finished my video on crypto grifters why is why is crypto full of scams and I say the word Alex was the name Alex machinsky a few times yeah he's one he got in your top five yeah yeah top three grifters yeah he'd definitely be in my well I could guess the other ones dokwon uh the three hours capitals boys yep those top three nope well cause they just took they are they're not grifters because they they didn't like take in users deposits or or I guess there are levels of grift I mean they were super irresponsible right they're very very irresponsible but they were irresponsible with I guess they were irresponsible with other people's money but like what's a crafter yeah anyways you got two out of the three so we'll save the third for the video there we go uh jobs time this is our reminder even though it's a bear Market there's tons of companies doing tons of hiring because they have a lot of money that they've raised during the bull market David should I read a few out are you gonna dance please do I'm gonna dance uniswap Labs hey they're on here at developer relations lead what is that uh not technical yeah it seems not technical you're talking to technical people but it's absolutely non-technical a senior front end and engineer at uniswap Labs senior back-end engineer for their trading platform you know swap Labs hiring a lot solid World Dow senior web 3 developer Rubicon smart contract engineer bankless needs a social Lord for social technical molecule needs ahead of Engineering bankless also needs a growth marketer economia needs a lead designer silent protocol a full stack smart contract engineer get your job in crypto during the bear run the way you do it is by logging on to bankless.palot.com put your email address in you get these alerts via email that is the way to do it David what do we got coming up next questions from the nation uh got a nice spread of questions uh and also the takes of the week uh the five Horsemen of D5 Mr Wonderful's investment strategy AKA Kevin O'Leary which I thoroughly disagree with so we'll talk about that and why you don't cut Corners in crypto uh as well as what Ryan and I are bullish on so all of that and more right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible and so we don't have to dump on you the brave browser is the user first browser for the web 3 internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multi-train crypto wallet built right into the browser web3 is freedom from Big Tech and Wall Street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wall and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are required which gives Brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets Brave wall is your secure passport for the possibilities of web 3 and supports multiple chains including ethereum and Solana you can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp and of course you can store send and swap your crypto assets manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps so whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned Pro it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet Download Brave at brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started Arboretum is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the coolest new nft collections have chosen arbitrum as their home while D5 protocols continue to see increased liquidity in usage you can now Bridge straight into arbitrum for more than 10 different exchanges including Finance FTX UOB and crypto.com once on arbitrum you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees allowing you to explore New Frontiers of the crypto Universe new to Arbitron for a limited time you can get arbitrum nfts designed by the famous artist ratwell and sugoi for joining the arbitrum Odyssey The Odyssey is an

arbitrarm at bridge.arbitrum.io and access all of arboretum's apps at portal.arbatrum.1 in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and fiction free got a question for the nation here's some questions we have coming up as always you can follow bankless HQ on Twitter every Wednesday we tweet this out a question from the nation you can put your reply here and we may read it on the roll up this is how we interact with the community here's the first one from Wesley Tate is asking this question I'm going to tee you up for this David what are some examples of layer 3 apps that you guys can Envision for the future of ZK sync or other ZK Roll-Ups and do you have any thoughts on whether or not optimistic rollups will successfully reach layer 3 without sacrificing ease of use cost most importantly security I can hear in some people's reading of this question like another question which is layer three what you guys just been talking about Layer Two what is Layer Three is this some new marketing mumbo jumbo term what is layer three I could tell Wesley Tate listens to the bankless podcast because that came up in our earlier state of nation episode with ZK sync but tell us really quickly what what layer 3 is and then attempt to answer answer Wes's question here yeah so I mentioned late earlier about the app chain model of Cosmos versus the layer threes on ethereum so we have layer twos we have generalized layer twos which kind of feel and act like ethereum itself it's a generalized platform you can put any code on it you can deploy anything but even those things can actually approach some level of saturation or congestion now the difference of ethereum being congested is like the transaction fees go from five dollars to a hundred dollars a layer two gets congested and it goes from one penny to maybe a dollar but even a dollar is like too high of a transaction fee to pay for like so many use cases so many use cases require like point one cent transactions or less to really be unlocked and that and that is where we go from you know a lot of scale to infinite scale and layer threes is where we get that done so not only are layer threes the ultra super super cheap super fast layers but they're also the more Express massive and like customizable and specific layers going back so uh when dydx Ryan left ethereum to go to the cosmos ecosystem and become an app specific chain that was in contrast to what it could have done which has become a layer three on on ethereum either on top of like ZK sync or starkware or something but the layer 3 ecosystem just wasn't ready yet but it's really starting to be especially with ZK sync mainnet coming right around the corner and so what are some examples of layer 3 apps that we can Envision for the future of ZK sync or other ZK rollups let's think about things that are going to be crypto enabled but also want to be domiciled of one specific use case and I could see like if we have like a big AAA game for example World of Warcraft where Ryan and I use this idea of just like we kill a boss and like a sword falls on the ground and that sword is an nft and if you pick it up that nft goes into your wallet first that nft needs to get minted when the boss gets killed then it needs to get transferred into your wallet when you pick it up then you have a taxable event sorry uh but like we need these cheap free transactions to really make this possible but also at the same time like say this is World of Warcraft or blizzard blizzard doesn't want to share a chain with like a competitor or another games or anyone else they want full control over what that chain looks like and by the way if they want irreversible transactions that's the way they can put it in um and so layer threes are going to be like one chain for one thing at a time Reddit is on top of arbitrum on using arbitrums any trust model which is actually layered a layer two an optimistic Roll-Ups strategy of going off with this app chain model and I could actually even see like a specific subreddit which somehow becomes really really crypto enabled shout out re Finance this would probably be the first one where that activity those rewards upvotes updates like Rewards or whatever all of those things become like economic assets on a chain maybe they're all worth pennies but when the transaction fee is .0001 pennies and your upvote is worth a penny that's economic activity uh and so those are the two ones that come to mind but it's really like any sort of like coordinated community on the internet could find a layer three uh and there's a lot of there's a lot of communities on the internet I think one way to think about layer threes is chains on chains on chains right so ethereum being the the base chain the layer one and then ZK evm for example being a layer two and then you can actually stack chains Sovereign chains on top of the ZK evm and that because comes layer 3 and these as you said can be app specific but they get to retain their full sovereignty so dydx is a great example of this I think there could be other defy applications maybe big D5 applications that adopt this as a strategy I don't know if you saw the article uh this week David from uh Dan ellitzer but he talks about oh Danny Elsa wrote something yeah he basically the title of the article I can't I'm paraphrasing here is but you in a swap will have a chain this is the title oh yeah he was he gave out that tweet forever ago we included it in the weekly roll up and then and then that's and then I went over to unit swap headquarters in SoHo and I was like yo Hayden what's going on so like I I you know I mean Dan elster's making the case that uniswap will need its own chain at one point in time and you can imagine that being a sovereign chain of some sort maybe a layer three of some sort so these are the types of applications that we might see uh in the in the higher layers of the stack um let's go to the next question great question yeah when talking about Luna this is from discovercrypto.eath when talking about Luna we often use phrases like 50 billion deleted I think that's a Verbatim David Hoffman quote yeah that's that's amazing what does this really mean was the money actually burned or is the money still existing just in the pockets of early Luna adopters and or shorters what are we talking about there it's like I think there's like 50 billion deleted what do we actually mean it's like where does that come from yeah so this is it's a it's a facetious kind of sadly funny funny sad way of saying Capital destruction there's Capital creation and then there's Capital destruction so say say like somebody makes a makes a company five uh five ten people all start working on the startup and then they go public and then all of a sudden there's equity on the public market and that company has a market cap valuation of 500 million dollars 500 million dollars just got created out of thin air because the market values whatever startup they had at 500 million dollars so that was a capital creation event of 500 million dollars now when economies are good and they have stable foundations and people are innovating and exploring and building capital is created yet when economies are bad when we've invested we've made bad Investments interest rates have to go up Capital gets destroyed uh and so capital is largely a story that humans tell each other and this is why we emphasize like hard assets sometimes the dollar the gold base layer assets that things collapse back down into and times are bad and then there's risk on assets which where people buy when times are good but capital is just a story that we tell each other as to what this thing is worth so we can't sell the entire market cap of Apple and Amazon and like Netflix like The Apple Market Cap is like three trillion dollars if everyone sold all of their Apple stock all at once there would not be a transfer of three trillion dollars from buyers to own sellers right it would destroy a ton of capital because Apple stock would basically go to zero because there's not enough buying like there's a pretty Apple super liquid but it's not three trillion dollars worth of liquid liquidity and so when we talk about Luna and use a phrase 50 billion dollars deleted it's because the bid for Luna evaporated and so one day Luna was worth 50 billion dollars and then the buying pressure for that Luna asset went to zero therefore 50 billion dollars of capital which existed because there was once enough Buy dying there's enough of a story to buy Luna once that story ran out once the bid evaporated all of a sudden the 50 billion dollar that people had on their net worth balance sheet turned into zero and that is what I mean when I say 50 billion dollars was deleted yeah I think that's a good I think that's a good way to think about it it's like the story was deleted essentially right and like it's important I think I like that you brought liquidity into the picture there because we have to remember what how is a market cap determined well you just take the most recent price someone bought the thing and multiply that by the existing Supply right that's it that's all the market cap is you have to look at kind of like liquidity of if uh you know how many how much is available in the market to actually sell or like actually buy and how how um resilient is that market cap to cell pressure and Luna was not very resilient to cell pressure something like gold has really good liquidity something like the US dollar has has a lot of liquidity there's a lot of trading volume every single day on the dollar it's a much stronger asset and I do think you remember we did that episode way at the beginning of bankless about liquidity um and how liquidity is actually a pretty good definition of of money because that's kind of the I guess it shows the resilience of of money assurances that you should have the asset yeah exactly and that it's priced for what what you know you think it will be priced uh let's let's go to this question from Sean Gill 23 will we ever see high APR liquidity pools like D5 summer 2021 can we go back to the good old days David uh yes and no mostly no I think the high liquidity pools of defy summer were were one tiny phenomenon of the bull market and the same way like we don't we don't really see icos anymore but we do see token creation events I don't see we're gonna We're not gonna see high liquidity pool to uh pool twos of defy summer I think that was the high water mark we will see high yields we will see yields return some way somehow it won't be as big or grandiose or risky as we saw in defy summer it will return um it won't be that crazy it'll be much more sustainable and much more pragmatic I think particularly in the frontier right that'll move to like the frontier to Layer Two is to new D5 protocols to risk your things there is like a risk of return trade-off here where you see the higher apis they're probably going to be more risky and so keep that in mind as well uh all right David let's get to some takes here's one for me why don't you read it Ryan shot Adams says the US government literally sending our crypto developers into hiding right now imagine if we sent our internet entrepreneurs into hiding in the 90s I guess we're happy to let China fill the vacuum while we regulate the open internet out of existence and Ryan you are retweeting an individual's uh under the Twitter handle one-way function who says I've removed all of my crypto related code I've written from GitHub about seven years years worth of contributions to the space and will no longer be contributing code to the space under my real name all future code contributions will happen via a pseudonym David I just wrote this tweet out of pure frustration we are literally I'm I'm angry at the U.S I'm angry at our Regulators we are literally sending our crypto internet entrepreneurs into hiding in America it's what we're doing I can no longer imagine this imagine the early 1990s we set um you know Mark and reason into hiding because he was trying to hack on Netscape and he had a vision for this Netscape Navigator browser and there's some kind of Regulation against I don't know encryption technology and we said that that was illegal in the U.S and reason had to go into hiding become an anonymous developer in order to do it had to maybe move to a different country or deploy this stuff like that's what's at stake here and I'm angry that it seems like inaction by legislators and reaction by Regulators is making this happen in the U.S we are losing a generation of crypto entrepreneurs it's matting it's maddening it's frustrating it's completely unnecessary I go back to uh commissioner Summer from the cftc her line from her descent it didn't have to be like this it doesn't have to be like this this is so stupid we're shooting ourselves in the foot crypto is going to be fine I don't know if America is if it continues to persist in trying to regulate itself out of innovation and assist its population live in a financial prison done rant David what's next thank you thank you zero X tuba says I would say that these are the five Horsemen of defy I don't think any other protocol comes close and it's a screenshot of maker Dow Lido curve Ave uniswap Xerox Cuba is saying these are the five Chads of D5 the five defy apps that aren't going anywhere that are probably relatively low risk bets is what 0x tuba is saying uh would you agree with this these five I like this list a lot actually yeah yeah I think people are going to take offense to Lido being in there but it's hard to argue with they have more beef in there in there I certainly like maker curve Ave and uniswap and what I'll note is this is all very like class of last bear Market this is very class of 20 uh 2019 2020. do you see plenya how to take this week which is like hey all of the Innovation actually happened in 2019 or 2018 2019 and not a lot has happened after that in terms of like apps that we've built that are valuable and persistent right I mean you could point to nfts but beyond that at I mean what else have we built right I mean I I think that answer will come out as more and more D5 2.0 apps do make it through the bear Market um not all well uh but I'm reminded of one of my favorite van Spencer tweets saying stop asking for new narratives we are one percent of the way through the current narratives yes like we still like uniswap is enough like being able to make your own token and put it on uniswap instantaneously incredible is huge like don't forget about how massive that is yeah don't don't fade the OG D5 protocols that's for sure Kevin Leary says my investment strategy for crypto is the same I've learned from stocks in all caps diversify I own positions in 32 different coins and tokens Ryan what do you think about this week I think that's the opposite of the what I do I do not I mean I think personally I think this is terrible advice no disrespect to Mr Wonderful advice it seems like you're just random like you could find yourself randomly shotgunning into a bunch of different tokens that are actually highly correlated or basically the same thing and calling that diversification that's not really diversification yeah in my mind but what's your take on it my take on this is that did you repeat that no I quote tweeted him oh you quote tweeted okay here it is can I read it sure guys this is David's take eth is a diversified index it's an index of the aggregate tokens and economic activity on top of ethereum where 90 of D5 is located eth is diversification for you tell us what you mean so many I don't maybe there are 30 tokens out there that are quality enough and maybe Kevin O'Leary has like a very beautifully Diversified portfolio he could I just I I think I think over two-thirds of his tokens are going to go to zero over the long term just by the nature of tokens and the cool thing is with tokens on ethereum and eip1559 ether gets the benefit of that so every token that comes attempts and then dies it that token went to zero but it burnt some ether along the way uh and so this is why ether is such a nice asset even in Bull markets when they're all these ponzis and all these stupid tokens getting minted and all these tokens are going to zero it's Bernie ether along the way and then there's also the tokens that will work maker uni of a compound curve those tokens are good tokens to have so maybe diversify amongst those but even those tokens also add to the aggregate economic activity on ethereum and so ether the asset as the index of the aggregate ethereum economy nothing better will do a awesome job of representing the ethereum economy as a whole than ether the asset and the ethereum the economy is where like 95 plus percent of all nft activity is 95 plus activity of where all D5 is and so ether is a beautiful index of some of the most alive parts of the whole entire crypto world uh and so the whole like pulling in diversification even even the s p is isn't actually a very good diversification tool so you have to diversify amongst that but this is something that like an older Boomer investors don't understand about crypto and that's why you can't just take stock strategies and apply them to crypto it doesn't work I feel like you're about to dump on us David are you about to dump all your teeth on us after that because I'm I'm the person that can move markets of ether Jesus yeah do you know what I don't hate though I actually don't hate like you know um the cryptex approach which is just a straight index of the top 30 by or a top X I can't remember top X let's call it 30 by market cap crypto it's a whole market cap the whole market cap that's the whole Market okay the whole market cap I do not hate that at all that's similar if you're talking about great that's great if you're talking about diversification because because I I agree with you about eth and of course we're like you know Perma bullish Heath what that doesn't capture though is like growth of BNB for example it's that growth of Cosmos outside of it doesn't capture growth outside other ecosystems you could buy the entire crypto market cap and you get all of that that is like that's definition definitionally perfect diversification rather than go like Rando pick 30 coins you bullish on and call that diversification I think people get into trouble that way but I'd love to see Kevin's 32 coins so because I could I would probably make fun of them well let's uh David's portfolio against Kevin's portfolio throw it down you guys should make a you know Warren Buffett style bet um let's go here in almost all cases it's the mistake to try and speed up adoption by compromising on crypto-centric product design that is punk4156 saying this what does he mean uh he's saying don't cut Corners uh and so compromising on crypto-centric product design I would call this what Luna did I would call this what Wonderland did there are like certain Properties or ethos of crypto that you can ignore if you build a D5 project and then as that D5 project is stress tested it accidentally becomes a Ponzi scheme uh whether you're intended it to be that or not and so the call to action here is build something that doesn't cut corners and is crypto-centric uh and this is also a topic in my grifters video that'll come out next week do you know what's in you know it's an interesting rule of thumb I wonder how well this applies is like don't buy anything that was built during the bull market yeah yeah if you because you can't really trust it or you don't know yeah you don't have the signal it needs to weather the downside Yeah Yeah by the thing that was built during the last bear market and survived uh anyway all right David what are you bullish on this week my friend all right I'm both on New York uh the city I've been having a great time man yeah I don't really know much about New York the state but New York the city is has been amazing it's fulfilled all of my hopes and dreams uh after moving here uh so this is my call to action for people who are curious about going full-time crypto Society not just crypto work if you want to have the maximum exposure to the crypto industry you gotta move to New York uh it is the best I am having a fantastic time sponsored by the New York tourism doesn't have to dump his eat on you that's awesome you've lived in some great places though like you've lived in uh you know Seattle that's a great place nice place you've also San Diego people moved from all over the like country to get to San Diego yeah and you like New York and it's because of the people because it because it ain't the weather my friend yeah well I know that's so bad but it's definitely the people the people that are the Williamsburg specifically where all the crypto people are uh is it's so awesome just to have everyone around uh and there's something just magical about the crypto people that want to be around other crypto people and talk crypto the people here in new New York specifically attracts very interesting people and then there's crypto side of New York that you know you add another layer of crypto interestingness on top of that and it's just a fun time man I've been having a great time here one day I'll take the Northbound train come up see you one day oh yeah yeah definitely all right Ryan where do you bullish on zk's sake my friend the ZK evm uh it was a great episode that we did but just in general technology it was really cool I mean uh coming off the podcast with uh vitalik where he said a few things he said um ZK is as fundamentally important as blockchains themselves ZK uh technology ZK cryptography as fundamentally important as blockchains he said uh they plan to in the future ethereum roadmap plans to ZK snarkify the evm I don't fully even know what that means even after an episode with a vitalik I feel like we need a deep dive like title of the episode if anyone downloads it Zeke snarkifying the evm like just that because I want to learn um so that's cool but then also he said I'm survive uh surprised at the progress of the ZK evm and now in less than 30 days we're gonna have the first CK evm on mainnet now it won't be accessible to users but like I was mentally probably two years ago thinking that ZK EVMS were five years out if they even happened the whole thing was I was kind of preparing myself to just say oh this is gonna be like another plasma thing gonna be like a state Channel thing they'll get far enough along the design and just it something won't work and they'll have to Pivot and yet here we are so that's what I'm really excited about this has been called the Holy Grail I mean you have to launch the thing and kick the tires and actually test it before we know for sure but um I think it's the most exciting thing happening in crypto right now like in the post merge world what's next ZK EVMS are what's next yeah I can't emphasize how awesome that state of the nation uh was this week with with Steve from from zksync uh it was it was definitely longer on the longer side for uh for a state of the nation but it's it was just so good and so the YouTube comments loved it that's awesome this is Ryan and David dumping on you because we are advisors to zk6 that's true we are advisors to zk's thing and you'll find that in the advisory page but that's actually not why I'm excited about it I'm like I'm I'm here for the tech bro okay uh ZK EVMS uh all right what's the meme of the week David meme of the week here we go this is uh trustless State and Ryan Sean Adams on trustless State uh when the ether is getting burned more than it's issued I actually don't know where this meme is but I think this is two people what two people these are profession these are sport these people play sports I could tell they play sports it definitely plays Sports it looks like the Olympic team but the Olympics are not going on but yeah maybe it's soccer but the guy has a Europe shirt anyways it's two dudes who are definitely playing sports watching something happening there just holding hands looking like looking on the edge of Tears they're they're just broken at the just the feeling of you for it that was my exact face that guy on the right is my exact face when wait so are you the guy on the right I don't know is that is that how you identify because I did identify myself as the guy on the left oh wow there you go yeah I'm the guy on the right my face contorts in that way when I'm very emotional like that's definitely me you get you see the hair it's a little patchy you know like that's me I'm the guy to write for sure oh maybe it's a hair yeah I have the hair on the guy in the left yeah that's right the hair that did it it's accurate right people would have said it I may as well claimed it uh all right guys risks and disclaimers of course gotta tell you once again first we have a festic Moment of Zen coming up after Ryan Gibbs it's one of my favorite moment of Zen's uh it's it's a interview on Capitol Hill of bankers and Congress and then it also cuts to uh where was that movie The Big Short as well uh so you know it's good uh so pay attention to that cut otherwise you'll get confused but first Ron's going to read you some disclaimers none of this has been Financial advice ethos risky so is Bitcoin so is defied always is you can definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot the gentleman from Indiana Mr Hollingsworth is now recognized for five minutes well good afternoon I'm excited to be here with each of you before I get started on my questions Mr Moynihan I wanted to let you know so Ruthie raise your hands to Ruthie she has been my team member for a couple of years now but on Monday she becomes a Bank of America team member about which she is very very excited so I hope you'll take good care of her and know and recognize the talent that she has shown already in our office I'm sure she'll do the same at Bank of America we will do that and her father already works
