so this is something I always think is super ironic in 2017 the ethereum bull market was partially catalyzed by everyone wanting to buy ether so they could stake it and that was me I was like oh gotta get as much ether as I can get passive income baby yeah passive income because they're going to go to proof of stake in 2018 and then 2018 came and like the road map just like was not defined and then we went to a bear market and then like defy summer hit and I was like oh yeah like proof of stake by the end of 2020. like oh my God you've got to get as much ether as I can so like so I can stake it at the end of 2020 and then like that came and went and then like now we're into the second the last part of 2022 and we actually have it scheduled that's true this time so instead of like being the Catalyst for like a bull market that's actually happening right now it's a catalyst for a bull market that is completely proof of like ethereum proof of stake being driven right now
