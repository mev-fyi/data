ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com gemini is the world's most trusted

protocol robert welcome to the nation hi david and thanks for having me yeah so this is a pretty interesting project that came across my radar not too long ago and so i kind of want to want to dive into it before we actually get into the intricacies of what liquidity is maybe let's uh provide the foundations listeners are probably familiar with many of the other defy apps in ethereum maker dow compound ave maybe maybe you could kind of provide the foundation for the mental models uh so we could get into describing uh liquidity later like where should we start where does this conversation begin sure that's a great place to start so maybe i should say that like we have two foundations one is based around the concept of stable coins and the other is based around borrowing now maybe let me start with stable coins so you have like those different types of stable coins and one of them is known as crypto backed we have a few examples like maker dao and others which are following that like approach now liquid in the sense is in that sense it's also similar i mean we are issuing our own stable coin called the lusd which is obviously back to the us dollar and which is supposed to follow like the dollar price so it's a bit like different from those other systems which only have like a relatively loose like peg mechanism let's say ample force is relatively like just loosely following um stablecoin but we are trying to really uh create like a hard peg so that's the stable point aspect and on the other hand the way to achieve this is by issuing lusd as alone to people who want to borrow now i'm borrowing is uh collateralized so you need to basically um put up like some deposit in eth which is our only cholesterol type so you can get a loan against it is and like that's the borrowing aspect and i would like to emphasize that our main goal when i set out like and built this or came up with this system was mainly around borrowing and less about creating like a new stable coin but what i or what we want to do is really cr is to create like the most attractive borrowing environment in the d5 space by basically doing two things by um lowering the minimum collateralization ratio and making the loans more capital efficient and also by doing away with interest rates so those are the two um benefits that we are offering okay so it seems like the most comparable model is maker dow and people are familiar with maker dow you take your ether or your other collateral you put it in maker dow there's 150 percent over collateralization requirement because maker dow really wants that to be safe uh and then there's also the stability fee that maker dao has which fluctuates up and down which is how they kind of control the peg that seems to be the most similar product but liquidity has uh very some of these parameters tweaked right so what would you say are the main uh parameters that are actually different from maker dow that gives you guys that competitive edge so yeah it's first and foremost this minimum collectorization ratio which is set to 10 110 percent and obviously we need to make sure that the system is safe so that we can still liquidate the positions even though like we require much less margin than maybe other protocols including maker and the way we achieve this is by improving upon like liquidation by replacing like a lengthy auction or an interactive way of liquidating those positions by something which can be done instantaneously so um i can maybe delve into a bit more details there but that's like one like feature another is of course like as we already mentioned that we are not charging an interest rate but we do charge an upfront fee when you take out your loan um which is algorithmically adjusted like the system automatically determines like the right amount of uh like the percentage that you would need to pay up front when you take out the loan but that's it so it's much more i would say like predictable for you as a borrower because you don't need to pay like any variable interest rate later on okay so it seems like uh liquidity is going after a much more governance minimized uh stable coin so maker dow they have mkr governance right and mkr governance can almost change anything about the maker dow protocol uh what is there to change or what have you guys actually figured out how to fix in liquidity or liquidity excuse me that um that makes this a more governance minimized system so um the way this works is that we we have a fee mechanism but which is only like a secondary mechanism to keep the peg where it should be our main mechanism to keep like the currency stable and packed to the us dollar is a redemption mechanism and maybe i can explain it in a nutshell so [Music] you may know that other or you certainly know that like most like centralized field back currencies they have like redemption right or at least in theory people can um exchange their like stable coins back to some field money which gives those currencies like a stable like price floor and we're trying to replicate something similar but in a completely decentralized way now in liquidity by um giving anybody the right many holder of lsd to exchange the lusd um for ether but the way that you would get like the dollar amount like at face value so you when you own like 100 edius you can exchange it for a hundred dollars worth of ether so obviously when the peg or when the price of one area is below one us dollar you would then have an incentive to redeem and sell uh the ether afterwards so that you can make an arbitrage gain and that's like a main mechanism to keep the currency stable so we are not reliant on a variable interest rate in the first place to keep um like the value stable but we still have those fees as a secondary mechanism to modulate basically the attractiveness of loans i mean by increasing the fee you can make them less attractive and by lowering the fee you can make them more attractive and the way this works is by using the redemption volume or the redemption rate at which people are redeeming as a signal or a call so that i can and contract oracle in our system to determine uh the issuance fee which is the fee that you pay as a borrower so and there are many redemptions or large redemptions it means that the price is probably below the floor so the system knows oh i have to increase the fee and it would then increase the fee by a certain fraction and that makes borrowing less attractive of course and should throttle the generation of new lsd and then it does like help the price to go back to one dollar and then if no more redemptions happen uh this the fee would decay over time so it would then go back to 0.5 percent which is like the minimum fee it's like a floor there okay so something i a common theme that i see in a lot of these uh governance minimized uh protocols is there's this concept of a governor and a governor is like this older uh mechanism for that really solved the the problem of the steam engine where like if the steam engine ran too hot this like governor which is like these two metal balls on it where they would spin around and mainly it was it was a regulator it was a mechanism for regulating the energy in the system and that's kind of what i'm seeing here there's this fee that is uh going up and down as people leverage the protocol and so if people are redeeming a lot the fee goes up correct and then if if people aren't redeeming enough then the fee goes down and this is just trying to tweak with human incentives to help maintain the peg so so let's just go through this one more time so i'm so me and the listeners can follow through let's say lusd is trading at a dollar and 10 cents what would be the expected behaviors of the market participants in this scenario so that's an interesting scenario because what i just mentioned before the redemption is like it's basically a one-way mechanism that helps you to restore the peg whenever lusd trades below one dollar or one dollar minus the current fee i should specify but there is this other case when um the lsd trades above 110 110 is like another threshold so we have this lower threshold at one dollar where the redemption mechanism should kick in as a very strong mechanism to push the price back now when the price in like exceeds 110 what happens is that thanks to this very low um liquidation ratio room collectorization range of 110 percent you can now basically take out a loan at the minimum ratio at this one or ten percent and sell um the lsd on the market so that you would get back or a higher price for like the borrowed amount than what you deposited in eth so basically you can take out the loan and generate free money from it whenever the price is above 110. so we have this range between one dollar and 110 uh where like the earliest d can like fluctuate we don't uh like we are not claiming that it will be always like very close to the back to one dollar but what we can say is that we still have those like soft pack mechanisms in our system that are also around in maker and other like uh collateralized uh platforms which mean that as long as the market expects the price to go back due to this longer term perspective the and the shelling point mechanism and also like those hard floor and saving then this should be priced in so it makes sense for you to take up more loans if the price is let's say at one zero five as long as you believe that eventually it will go back to one dollar so that you can repay your loan at a lower rate so that's how this should be priced in and hopefully make make it so that the price stays relatively close to one dollar so one of the critiques of the maker dow model is that the arbitrage loop is really really slow and so uh if dye is trading at one dollar and 10 cents people are incentivized to deposit their collateral and mint die sell that die for that 10 cents premium and then they have to sit on their hands and wait for that die premium to come back down to a dollar um and that the the counter opinion or counter example is with usdc where if usdc is trading at a dollar somebody can wire funds into circle immediately mint the uscc immediately sell it for east sell that eath on the market pocket that difference in a moment but with maker dow you kind of have to sit on your hands and wait for the market to slowly um work its way back into efficiency it does does uh liquidity have any um faster loop like market loop mechanism or is it roughly the same as maker dowse so it's basically a combination of both so whenever it's above 110 or below 1.99 it will leverage this kind of fast feedback or fast arbitrage cycle where people could immediately make arbitrage gains which then should like push the price back to this like range between one dollar and 110 and within that range we we are reliant on like the slower softback mechanism maybe there is one difference or two differences there if i can go like get a bit more technical here so we have like a stability pool which is used as a buffer to uh whenever a position needs to be liquidated it's basically absorbed by this pool which is used to repay the debt of the liquidated borrower now what then could happen when like basically the price of one lsd is way above one dollar but maybe still less than 110 then those depositors in the stability pool i mean they their gains will depend on the current um elias the dollar price and the higher uh the dollar price of lsd the lower their net gains in case of liquidations because they gain the collector from the position and they lose their lsd that they deposited in the pool so there can be like this effect that as the price goes up it becomes less attractive to stay in the pool so people would take out withdraw their deposits and maybe sell them on the market which should then help to um like stabilize the price around one dollar so that's like maybe an additional incentive mechanism fantastic yeah that's pretty cool so we were talking about the fees where do those fees go like let's follow that path where what happens when they they pay the fee where where does that fee get collected right so that's a an important question because in our system there exists a secondary token we call it the lqty token so we have the lsd stablecoin and the lqty fee capture token so to say because this token can be staked by any holder and then become eligible to receive both fees the issuance fee from the borrowers but also the redemption fee okay so yeah it's a fee capture token um so people are receiving dividends in lusd um in both actually like for some implementation reason the the borrowing fee is captured or is is charged in lsd while the redemption fee is charging eth so you will get a mix of both okay very cool all right so that makes sense it's a it's a token that offers you passive income in lusd and heath and for for all the ethereum people out there that should be very interesting you know um so but you said uh earlier you said that ether is the only collateral in the liquidity system is that going to be true forever or is that is is is uh liquitea and inherently an eth maximalist uh protocol um so it's a bit uh like both words i would say that currently it's an east maximalist protocol and we can't change it because it will be an immutable and governance-free system i mean that doesn't rule out that maybe in in the in the future we would like to uh maybe create like a second system which would run in parallel which would accept maybe a rep bitcoin or some other interesting collateral type but we currently we don't see many good contenders for other collateral types just because they would need to fulfill like a set of criteria at the same time like they should have a large enough market cap they should be fully decentralized because that's like one of our like main uh goals and then also uh just be like trustworthy and large enough and uh yeah and there aren't that many good candidates but uh yeah we will like monitor the market and maybe at some point uh revisit the question right so like say that there is a collateral asset that comes along that does tick all the boxes that you guys are interested in if you guys were to include this in the liquidy system would it be in the same system as the ether system or would you just spin up two versions and they would be separate do you get what i'm asking sure yeah i mean this will most likely or for technical reasons it has to be like a secondary system i mean theoretically we could make it so that people could migrate i mean if the new system let's say it's a multi-collateral system which could also be a possibility then we could offer an easy migration tool for people who want to close their positions in liquidity version 1 and migrate to liquidity version 2. and i think that actually points out another really key difference between liquidy and maker dow where when you deposit your assets into maker dow you get an account right your assets are your account there's one address or that your assets are into and they don't they don't get commingled with anyone else's uh with with liquity i i think that there is a pool there's a singular pool of all the ether collateral is that correct um so not really so it's still like held by your trove we call it positions we call it both it's marketing lingo um so those are like separate i mean we do have more pools in the system than maybe other protocols the stability pool and also some other pool we call it default pool which then redistributes like some defaulted that as a fallback mechanism but uh um but basically the positions themselves they are still like held um okay on your wall still held by the individual so like there's still like a vault for for talking about maker dow language there's still one single vault per user right okay cool um and then also something to bring up it's i don't believe there are any oracles in uh the liquidity system right because this is all the soft peg is done by um market participants or are there oracles included the oracle's included because we still need to get the ethernet we don't need to get that very useful price yeah so the lsd price is like indeed directly determined by this redemption volume detection mechanism but for the ether we need for the liquidations and also for the redemptions by the way we need to know how much ether somebody should get when redeeming an amount of values d so for that purpose we are using chain link as our main oracle um we do have like quite a sophisticated fallback mechanism where we are falling back to tell or if chaining fails but we we are very um confident that this wouldn't happen so this is really just uh like an emergency way so it's not that we would take like an aggregate of the two oracles but just detect if there's a failure and then fall back to tell her if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract

which is uh liquidy.org um and then this last features page is really really nice something that i think is new from you guys is that you guys are not actually building out your own front end but you are actually figuring out a way to incentivize others to build out the front end can you go into that sure so yeah that's really one of the key innovations besides like the mere economics of borrowing um because we we have a couple of reasons why we are doing this so we we want to make sure that this system is also decentralized um on the front-end side so not just uh fully like immutable and governance-free on the back-end but we also wanted to be as censorship-resistant as possible and in order to achieve that it is like important to give people an incentive to run a front end i mean we don't we don't want to just rely on altruists or or like enthusiasts so that's why we have an inbuilt like we can't call it like a yield forming thing but it's really that that there is this secondary token the lqt which is groups one of them are the stability depositors who not only get liquidation gains from each liquidation but they also get like an allocation of lq divide over time just for the time they are inside being in like inside the pool and now what the front ends can do they can set a kickback rate and then based on the kickback rate um the turnover that they generate and by turnover here i mean the amount of stability deposits that they attract and which are connected to their frontline and and then put into this stability pool now based on that kickback rate um this lqtvi allocation would be split between the front-end and all the stability depositors the end-users that's very cool that so that actually starts to create this free market competition between entities that could be like zapper xerion instadap even coinbase gemini even some of these the bigger exchanges could all offer front ends and they're all going to compete for fees i think that's a pretty clever mechanism yeah and we hope so that that this will lead to like an interesting competition um we expect this competition to be a bit um reliant on the amount of extra functionality or features that the front end will offer to the end users even though we are going to release or provide a launch kit which people can just download and take as is that launch kit will be pretty much bare bones in in the first like let's say a few weeks of operation we will improve it later but like the first version won't be as nice maybe as it could be but this gives like other like developers like an incentive to create their own skins or front ends add maybe some extra functionality like let's say automatic leveraging or or like multiple actions uh combining on transactions stuff like that so and those um front ends they may have like they have a better spot in the market so they can maybe have a lower kickback rate and still attract more users than a front end that just like reuses our launch kit very cool that's very cool so l usd it's another stable coin on ethereum there's there's a few of them it's a governance minimized stable coin and there's not very many of those yet it is still a stable coin which means that it's in competition for liquidity how are you guys uh fighting that fight like how are you guys trying to incentivize liquidity for lusd um so we are just uh setting up or we just decided to add a liquidity provision incentive scheme which will be based on unisop so unisop lps for an lusd east pool would get lqty as a reward this will be pretty like a short-term incentive program because at some point ethereum sorry unisop version 2 will be replaced by unit swap 3 and we don't want to over like to continues incentivizing people on unisof version 2 and we can't change it in the future so that's why we are like we are trying to just set a high enough incentive for the first few weeks of operation so that we can attract like a lot of liquidity in that specific pool which is important for leverage seekers for people who want to exchange their lsd for other tokens in the end but it's also fine i would say if like other users they stay within the system at least in the in its infancy because what they can do is they can take out the loan in lsd and without even exchanging it to other tokens they can simply put that lsd in the stability pool and then start earning the rqty and the liquidation gains and by doing so they would also make the system more robust against price shocks awesome let's finish up with the lq lqty token uh how how is that distributed uh who's got their hands on it how much is set aside for liquidity incentives where is all of the tokens so we have a total of 33.33 percent of lqtvi tokens that will go to the community as an incentive and basically there will be three recipient groups like the two i mentioned at the beginning the front ends and the stability depositors and in addition to that there are also the unislop lps and uh so what that means is that we we have 32 percent of the tokens that will be split among the front-ends and the stability depositors and 1.33 percent that goes to the use of that piece and maybe what's important to say or emphasize is that like the the larger fraction the 33 percent is given out um according to a reward schedule which is pretty similar to bitcoin it has this kind of halving every year so like in the first year it would give at 16 and then eight and so on uh so early adopters have a much higher incentive to be become involved and because it's a decaying function there could actually be liquidity awards for many many many years into the future right right so it never ends basically it can go on forever it just decreases right and in theory the value of the lqty token would be lower today and but more of it is being issued but in theory like let's say it's it's five years from now you guys have halved it five times in a row but if the lqty token has actually done a 5x then you're actually distributing the same amount of dollar value over that over that in five years from now which is actually kind of cool yeah that would be like really our optimistic scenario that like the value that the protocol can distribute to its users like remains constant or even grows even though the nominal amounts um shrink that's pretty cool um and and just to clarify these yield farming there's no yield farming has actually started yet this is going to happen do you know when this is going to happen yes so we are targeting launch around in four weeks um so we are pretty much done with the back end and the front needs some tweaks but it will be ready uh shortly and we are ready to go fantastic all right so if one if anyone in the bankless nation wants to learn more about liquidity or join the community where should they go so we overhauled our website so it it's pretty new now with all the information and the white paper was just released yesterday the new version so everything is there we have this features page you mentioned for people who just want to get like a quick overview and then we also have a docs section with a lot of technical resources including simulation results from gauntlet and from a monetary economist and audit reports and stuff like that and we also have an sdk for those folks who want to build their own custom front end it's still working in progress but we already have like a pretty complete api reference guide and yes so we also have a few videos on youtube which are linked in on our website um where we explain like the difference between our system and maker dao and some other aspects awesome and we will get those links into the show notes as well i'm super curious about this protocol i think there is a glut for a governance minimized stable coins uh you know people harp on maker dow for not being governed governance minimized enough and i think that's you know sure i could believe it but there's definitely room for further and further governance minimized stablecoin so i'm really excited for l usc to make it out into the market robert thanks for coming on the show and meeting the nation thank you so much this was an awesome interview cheers cheers
