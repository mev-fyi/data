[Music] what's up coordination today on the pod we got kimball musk kimball is a legend here in boulder colorado where i live uh kimball is a chef an entrepreneur and a community member both in the meat space and now a community member in the dow space and he has started big green dao a dal that has created millions of dollars of funding for up to 46 non-profits who create food justice so basically since 2011 kimball's been helping teach people to grow food growing food improves nutrition security mental health increases time spent outdoors and cultivates a deeper appreciation for our collective impact on the climate kimball's been doing that irl for the last 12 years or so and kovid changed the way he approaches this philanthropic work he is now building big green dow a dow that supports schools families and communities across the country to build to grow their own food through training grants garden bed donations and providing materials to the teachers and the growers who are building garden programs i think that what's really interesting about big green dow is a the object level impact it's creating food justice for thousands of people across the world but also kimball's perspective as a successful business person having been involved in tesla having been being involved in many internet age businesses and the patterns that he sees in which he's trying to leverage to decentralize philanthropy with big green dow so really interesting episode always appreciate kimball musk's perspective and the world that he wants to create which is more food justice and using dowels to scale the ability to do good in the world so coordination really great episode for you today without further ado i give you kimbo musk so you've got some money but how are you gonna use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with

how's it going hey kevin how you doing i'm pretty good so excited to have you here to talk about big green dow today uh tell us about big green dow and how you got into food security you know i have been working on food uh for 22 years uh i my background wasn't in technology with my brother uh i have the uh wonderful honor of being part of the internet during its early early days and my brother and i built a company called zip2 that where we were the first kids literally i think the first people in the world to see door-to-door directions and maps on your computer it really was uh extraordinary at the time continues to be extraordinary but so to be able to put our stamp on the internet that way is really cool and after that when we sold the company i decided to go learn to be a cook because i was literally a chef food has always been my passion i went to new york learned to cook didn't really think i would open a restaurant but i had the awful and also amazing experience of being in new york during 9 11 right after i graduated cooking school and i got a chance to cook for the firefighters for six weeks really changed my view in the world on how much community is created through food in fact it brings me you know really maybe the common theme of the big green down and what what i experienced there was community seeing these firefighters come in from these giant piles of melting metal covered in dust the chefs me and a whole bunch of others who were just lucky to be volunteers frankly because there were so many people trying to volunteer and we we cooked for them and then they would come to life and we would send send them back out that put their put their suits back on go out in these giant piles of melting matter metal literally melting weeks after after 9 11 and to go dig through to save american lives it was uh the most powerful experience that i had you know until that point for me and got me into got me into food so then i saw opened a restaurant in colorado started supporting non-profits working in helping kids connect to food then um in 2010 i had a personal very serious accident where i was like you know my life can end at any moment let's i'm just going to double down on what i really care about which is food and and philanthropic work in food justice which is not the same thing as food you know food justice is about uh equity and and people getting getting access to food whether it's for nutrition security or mental health and led me to forming big green amazing well it sounds like quite a journey and um it's really great to hear the backstory of how you became a chef and understood that community is is built through food um and i think that the the story of that leading up to big green dow um you know is is sort of special for me as a boulder right uh for those of you us who are listening to this episode from across the world you might not know but kimball's restaurants in downtown boulder the kitchen the kitchen upstairs the kitchen next door are a staple of how community is formed in boulder so uh you and i have that it's really beautiful how long have you been in boulder i've been here since 2013. um cool and i've always liked going to the kitchen kitchen next door to hang out with friends on weekends thank you yeah it has become i mean our mission from the beginning was a community bistro community through food and we really are this wonderful community hub in in town amazing um well community i think i want to talk about the parallels between community in person and online and i think that my next question is a bridge towards that so can you tell us about big green dow and the the why the what and the how of a big green dow yeah absolutely i mean what an exciting journey we've had uh i first of all i want to thank all of the people in web 3 that are watching this to uh be so gracious and helpful in having someone like me really a web 1.0 guy and then really been in web 2.0 sorry i skipped web 2.0 i didn't i didn't get into social media or anything i like to use twitter but other than that i don't really play in that space and so i again focus on food and involved with my brothers companies tesla and spacex but again they're not web companies you know so from uh from a web one to a web three jump pretty big jump and i just i'm so grateful for the warm welcome that i've gotten from everyone in in the web 3 community that i now count as i'm part of that so the uh uh big green we started out very successfully building these beautiful outdoor classrooms in schools around the country school gardens had always worked when they worked when people use them but the problem is they were always put in the corner of schoolyard and usually a teacher would retire or a passionate parent would graduate their kid and then the garden would stop getting looked after and you'd have to put more and more money into it every year and we decided to try a different approach which was a more permanent beautiful classroom that that is an edible schoolyard where kids grow food as they learn lessons primarily science so teaching science through the growing of food we got up to by 2020 but by the time i've covered it to where we got up to 650 schools around the country these are 50 to 100 000 outdoor classrooms like this big big deal and then um uh 350 000 kids but we're being taught every school day in our in our classrooms really i can't be more proud of the team and what we achieved but when covert hit schools were shut down we weren't allowed to literally illegal to work on school grounds and it continues to be so today even even two years later but for a year and a half we we weren't even allowed to do our work at all and so it was around then that i started to just talk about well how could i help in other ways how could we we at big green who we are experts now in the space i mean we've been been been working hard on the ground uh detroit chicago l.a pittsburgh memphis i mean some of the toughest neighborhoods in the in in the country and um doing good things but also realizing that this problem is way bigger than anything big green could possibly solve which is uh kids learn to eat really bad food from from a very young age kids go into kindergarten in these neighborhoods sometimes i believe over 40 percent of kids go into kindergarten obese that is not something that they did to themselves that is something we did to them and uh how do we help how do we help now that we can't do our gardens anymore uh and so we to be clear we do support our gardens that are in schools today we find we provide them financial resources to continue to look after them but because we couldn't travel because we had to really operate from um not even an office i mean we don't have an office anymore big green web 3 kind of was this magical solution that came along right when we needed it and web 3 is this way to build community without a physical presence so we have people from all over the world and primarily the united states but people also from all over the world that are on our discord uh discussing in their language so we have a chinese channel we have a turkish channel we have a greek channel we have a south korea we have a korean channel and um it is just incredible to watch them talk about these the the food the challenge of food just in their communities and web 3 enables us to build this community without physical without the need for physical presence that being said our community wants physical connection so we now meet once a quarter in person where our previous meeting was in atlanta the one before that was in denver the one coming up will be uh probably be in colorado we're not sure it'll be in july and august and the desire for these folks to travel from mostly again mostly from the united states but really also from around the world uh it's just incredible uh really really incredible we we are now a 19 person dow and in atlanta we probably had 30 people show up even even people who didn't have voting rights yet or were not able to participate because we're still kind of growing slowly they're like that's fine we just want to be there and it enabled us what what what we did we had a lot of financial support from our donors and we needed to figure out how to how to provide that financial support without physically being in a location so for example we want to help someone in in detroit in a suburb of detroit in our previous world in a pre-covered world we would we would either fly to detroit or we'd have someone there locally and in fact we had an office there and we'd get to know those people we would determine how good they are and whether or not we can help them financially in a web 3 world you decentralize that you give voting rights to people who who can pick the non-profits to support in detroit for example and then you also decentralize accountability so in a year from now when that nonprofit wants to ask for more money okay well what's the community say about how are they doing and all of that done all of that is done through discord and what's beautiful about it is the the web 3 the dow the actual dow part is so it's all transparent so we know exactly where the dollars go we know exactly how voting rights work like they might not be perfect we might have to change them but at least you know how they work um you you you have a trustless system that enables you to build amazing levels of trust because you if you were to ever leave the dao you you understand how you would be removed or you might choose to leave but people there's no one person who could violate your rights or take it away from you uh it's been profound and so as a result we've now given away uh almost a million dollars up until the end of march and now we're about to give away up to another 860 000 uh we have 46 applications for this quarter just so just so people know how the dial works many dowels are done very differently to us so what we did was we started with this concept of progressively decentralizing and it's a concept that matthew markman came up with he's a architect of our dao amazing amazing human uh and you can you can find him on twitter uh he he he just has this academic view on things rather than a uh what i did see a lot in which was really too speculation focused and that's not i don't want to judge it but uh that wasn't what we're doing we're philanthropy so he really helped me create something that was uh how do we do the how do we how do we do good things so we started with six non-profits rockstar non-profits that that big green knew really well and one of them is big green and five five um uh others uh three african americans one native american uh from the kochiti tribe and one hispanic amazing woman and then one person from big green and they voted to bring on 10 new non-profits last quarter and now we added some donors including myself i got a vote this time which is really cool which by the way is really cool like i gave up my vote in the beginning and then they gave me one back and like i think that's really cool now i feel obliged to vote of course which is exciting but you're like oh my goodness i i'm a my decisions matter i mean it's really cool and you guys at gitcoin have been an uh invaluable resource in teaching us how to how to vote effectively and assign dollars and so forth um but the uh we're gonna potentially bring up to 46 non-profits the 46 have applied that doesn't mean we would choose all 46 but we have funding for all 46 it would just be based on how much money they get and who gets more and less and you've really taught me this concept of quadratic funding and and i've heard about quadratic voting and really is wonderful to see it in action it's very hard to explain in words and then when you see it in action it's really fun it's a fun not a game i wouldn't call it again but it's because we're we're taking your advice we're not doing voting on one day we know we're doing it over a week or ten days you get to vote and and every additional vote you give in on profit is worth a little bit less and and you finish up and then you go to the discord and you discuss a little and then you go back to your voting and you can change your vote because you've learned a bit more and then over the week you kind of have this collaboration that is created and that's come back to community it comes back to this uh amazing power that web 3 has that is really different to the to the the web 2 or even non-web world where everything kind of pushes you towards collaborating pushes you towards community pushes you towards building relationships and i think that's very cool yeah it's it's so beautiful and i can it's hard not to see the symmetry between what you said about learning about how community gathers through food and how community has gathered around big green dow can you tell us a little bit about the symmetries or what's different about the two the digital versus the physical communities you've built you know that's a great question i don't think anyone's asked me that i think that in the case of food especially eating out at a restaurant where you you're you're uh you're maybe meeting someone for the first time or you're doing a business deal with someone and you kind of need neutral ground right and um when you go sit down at the restaurant you want to order a cocktail and you might uh just for like relax a barrier and then you kind of get to know someone a little bit more uh and then you by the end of that meal you know you've been a couple of hours with someone whether it's a first date with someone or your anniversary with your husband or wife or whether it's a business relationship you know that person much much more and it it was enabled by eating in this restaurant that that is that is uh just one of the magical frankly the reason i'm in it and when you when you apply it to big green dow what we see is something similar where people come together because there are some there's a selfish reason of course they want to get funded great or they might want to donate and have their philanthropy go to a food justice cause and i mean it's a very nice version of selfish but it's they're doing it for their own reasons and then when they're there the the same thing kind of happens as it happens in a restaurant you you might post something on discord you might do a quick vote here and there and then you get to get connected with someone else who might be voting similarly to you and you or you might want to ask them some questions why did you don't get to see each other's vote but you can ask questions about one nonprofit or another and and that that uh required conversation you know it's not really optional you got me not you choose not to involve at all but if you are if you choose to be engaged these conversations are kind of required you kind of have to talk to each other and then one barrier gets broken down after the other and all of your rights are protected through the the the dao governance so you can say things that that might really piss people off and because you're reading medium you mean it or you're passionate about it and no one can take you right away brought your rights away and that that has been wonderful to see the the conversations amongst the passionate conversations where you know people people really want to do good things here and they also know the responsibility they have if they if they succeed they meaning and i'm now part of it if we at big green dallas succeed at showing that this is a more effective more transparent more efficient use of uh philanthropy uh people have no idea how big this could get i mean philanthropy in america is half a trillion dollars a year half a trillion just in america and so you start to say well we won't get all of that okay that's fine i'm sure there's lots and lots of philanthropy out there that will stay in the more traditional ivory tower approach but um this is a decentralized approach and it it'll start taking some market share and you even get to .001 percent and you're in you know you're really up there in in in money and you guys at gitcoin have really shown us how much is possible i mean the the the dollars you guys have pushed through in such a re such a short period of time is uh is really an inspiration for us yeah yeah i mean i think that you know i see some great symmetries between get coin dao and big green down which is both creating financial tools quadratic voting in order to create object level impact and and i just want to revisit that object level impact before we continue the conversation i think you said a million between a little bit north of a million dollars has been deployed at big green dow how many miles does that feed in for how long so the way big green dow works is the recipients are uh like one one of them one of them is a non-profit in atlanta that that works with young kids she might have a few hundred kids that that she helps work with we have another guy who is in denver amazing um uh we call it a cultural leader in in denver and he he reaches many many more people um then the native american community it's uh we're talking many thousands of people but right we're not we're not focused on providing food we're focused on enabling uh food justice warriors to be more financially supported right these are people that already receive a lot of support uh and it's more like okay well now that you've received financial support from a you know a major foundation great right well how does it work when you receive funding from a community and that is very cool and new for all of the players right yeah i mean i think that that's just so promising because this cause is so noble and i think that one of the things that i really see in you kimbo is that you're disrupting philanthropy using decentralization tech and the nonprofit sector is so stagnant um that you i think you said that there's billions of dollars that are going through that sector i mean how how much does this scale how does web 3 scale do you think in order to disrupt non-profits and create even more of that object level impact across the world i love that question so the the beautiful thing about web 3 is if scale is something that is important to you i don't think there is a better platform and so if you think about big green down and the very nature of what we're doing if you try to do this centrally in other words we're going to add 46 nonprofits this quarter the next quarter we'll add another 100 and we're going to bring on another thousand donors we have almost 2 000 donors on board the amount of staff that we would need to process that would be tens of people this you know maybe 100 people this quarter we'd need a thousand people within a year from now and we have we have no hiring plan at all because this is all now done by the community so if we were to go from 10 million this year to 100 million next year and a billion dollars a year after that there's no further overhead in fact the overhead maybe i mean relatively speaking in dollars maybe like you know negligible because you do a hundred million dollars through and it only still costs you a few hundred thousand dollars to run this dow uh the more money you put through it the the better the more more efficient it is so i think that really that's one of the great things about web3 because if if we wanted to do this and i've had this question on so i i do these twitter spaces every uh every now and then on a sunday evening and in fact oh thank you you you're on it actually uh recently and and what i find there i get a question from people who are skeptics of web3 and they'll say well why don't you just run this on a spreadsheet like why why do you need web3 and the answer really is just about scale yes you can run this on a spreadsheet for a little while and then and then once you get to i don't know even this quarter which is only six months in uh you you can't run it on a spreadsheet anymore you just can't like this is now this would be um an accounting nightmare and a and a grant making nightmare to grow that fast in in in the philanthropic world and i can speak very personally to that i am a donor uh in fact i donated to bitcoin's climate change around i know how much of time it takes for me to evaluate an opportunity because i want to do a good job i do take that time if i said to myself and maybe my wife and we said you know this quarter i want to support 46 non-profits the idea is laughable there's no way i don't have the time or energy to do that they're not going to hire a team and then they got to be trained up whereas now with 46 non-profits and using web 3 tools i'm very excited about it might take me a few hours to participate as the voter but there are another 18 other voters and i'm very excited about that that's very cool refi summer has arrived and cello is here for it cello is the layer one blockchain for the regenerative finance movement it's fast planet

thank you for giving to get coin grants we really appreciate your contribution to the to the climate round um i think it's so incredible to hear from you and experienced philanthropist how web 3 allows you to scale there's no team to hire because you're kind of pushing the signal generation of which projects are worth funding to the edges and you're kind of with your community deciding how to evaluate an opportunity together and so i got to ask him but what do you think of what do you think of dows in general i mean is this a future category of of human organization and um you know where what are you excited about with dallas and and what are you not excited about when it comes to the category of dials in general you know so funny uh you know there's that term uh um the uh uh the converted person is the greatest fanatic i can't remember exactly the term you can convert someone you know they become the greatest fanatic and that was me you know when i started this process frankly i didn't really started it was a bunch of my friends who were working in web 3 that kept bugging me to give it a try and uh and uh when it came to philanthropy they weren't really talking about that they were just saying kimbell you should pay attention here there's some really interesting things going on these are all smart people who i trust i was like okay i'll spend a little time working on it but i was skeptical and then i learned about this concept of a dao where you can decentralize governance you can make it very not very you can make it totally transparent you you you can enshrine people's rights similar to the us constitution but actually in a smart contract where there's not even zero people to intervene because it's not possible so um uh i am i became the greatest fanatic i i think that daos are absolutely fascinating human experiments um i do think that that taos have their place there was probably a time when i thought dallas could do everything you know because i drank kool-aid and uh and then i then i said well you know in the case of big green dow as i was designing the architecture with with markman um we we started to game it out and we're like oh wait a minute you can't you can't probably do that oh you can't believe it you can't probably do that okay so what should we do here and i i i i gotta say we we put out 10 000 hours in into the governance of the big green dow and really encourage anyone who's curious about dallas to go to dow.biggreen.org and download the white paper and give it a read and you will learn so much there our dao is not perfect for all applications probably not perfect for our application but it's going really well and so i would say some a lot lot you can learn from there and so i would say that i went through that that process of the doubt could be used for anything and then i realized oh wait a minute a dao is useful very very useful for certain things and those certain things are when does decentralization actually help you and like a good example i don't want to knock climate change because you you obviously did your round with bitcoin and i supported it so don't get me wrong here i get approached all the time for a dow on climate change and my question back to them is how is decentralizing decision making helping that because you've got to deal with governments you probably need a representative in dc a lobbyist or or the united nations i just don't know maybe there's a way a doubt could help but i just don't know okay nothing comes to mind and then one of the one of these amazing uh non-profits working in deforestation you know climate change as it relates to deforestation came to me and i was like oh well that would be an obvious one where dao would be fantastic because deforestation happens on the edges of the amazon forest or it happens in northern canada or alaska or it happens in indonesia and you need you really benefit from decentralized decision making because someone in indonesia can help decide what's going on there on the ground with the you know palm trees being being uh being grown there and destroying the forest there or in or in the in the the farmland of akrei brazil okay i get it that's going to be amazing for a dao and then what i've also learned is this concept of decentralized accountability and that is another great example uh in big greendale there was that way that works is when someone in in detroit wants to apply again for another another round we'll have members of the dow in detroit help help us make that decision in the case of deforestation it's super valuable because people in brazil or in the in those communities will be able to say yeah this actually did stop deforestation and so it's not just the decision making it's the accountability that makes dao so valuable especially when it is useful to have decentralized um decision-making and decentralized accountability got it so it sounds like where decentralized accountability and decentralization uh sort of add value that's where you're a proponent of dallas um i'm curious you know what you think of of like uh of the category of impact dials in general uh we're starting to sort of think about how web 3 can be created for impact and like what would have to be true for impact owls to disrupt nonprofits and and ngos and and and become a top five or top 10 charitable giving or charitable organization in the future um i guess another way of asking this is what does the world look like where you're maximally successful kimball in creating a big green dow and having as much impact as possible you know i i love that question you know people look at me and and uh they they see me disrupting things you know whether it's my first business you know disrupting yellow pages or um uh big green you know doing doing this thing here it's actually a way it's way less uh uh dramatic than people realize so the way i would encourage anyone who's forming a dow to think about it is what do you need to do today what do you need to do next month what do you need to do the next three months and make sure you're doing those things correctly and then make sure you approximately have a 50-year goal right so let's imagine big green dow has a 50-year goal of showing the world that that of giving dowels where philanthropy can be used through dow's in an effective way uh great and that means like 100 billion dollars a year goes through philanthropic taos wow that would be a wonderful a wonderful uh fingerprint to have on on or legacy to have have in the world but actually that that's kind of put aside what matters is this quarter will we bring on great non-profits that will do really good things and will they join the dow and vote on the next round that's what matters and um if you get too caught up in the long-term vision uh i know that it's it's cool and fun to think that way but actually you end up losing sight on how to how to truly disrupt which is doing good things actually showing good progress on a day-to-day basis and keeping your eye very close to the ground on that and just know in the back of your mind that that it it if you do if you do good things you will change the world really no matter what you do got it i mean amazing i think that your point there about just making sure that you're focused on the road in front of you is so important for us who are working on the impact owls and dreaming big because it's really about that day-to-day execution that's going to make it happen and i know that i've seen that in the last five years as i've been building bitcoin i think that we're coming up on time in the next 10 minutes or so so i'd love to just ask a totally open-ended question is there anything i didn't ask that you want to that you want to tell us gimbal well i think the the most uh fun part for me is is being being an old person in web3 this is just fun right so i i started in the internet and uh back in 1994. so you know this is pretty actually mozilla just come out but pre-netscape and the whole thing and so people who know those times very very few people were believers on the internet and uh i remember working with my brother on this idea of creating a yellow page business online where you do this crazy thing you would type in the name of a you know i want a restaurant or i want dry cleaning and we would not just tell you the name of the businesses around you we'd show you a map of where they were we give you door-to-door directions to their location and um to me it was like so obvious that this is going to change the world and everyone is going to want to use this versus the paper yellow pages and i'm in a meeting with a guy who is probably my age you know 40 late 40s early 50s and uh he was the owner of the yellow pages in toronto canada and he he we're in the middle of my presentation showing him this incredible technology that's going to change his business frankly his business i mean and he stops the meeting and he picks up the yellow page which is big city right so a good three inch thick yellow pages and he throws it at me and he says do you ever think you're gonna replace this and in two years his business was a zero wow a hubris and so i just remember that and so when i think of being an old guy in web 3 i want to be a i want to be a better old person right got it so it seems like if you're not mindful of the disruption that could be coming your way then if you're not on that alpha if you're not on that frontier then you're vulnerable to people who are on the frontier and this is kind of a a way of of of staying sharp in in in a way i don't want to put words sharp staying sharp being super humble believing that that the world can change at any moment and you don't want to be caught you know sitting back drinking a mai tai thinking you've got to figure it out because that's just not how the world works and and of course young people i mean for sure in the past few decades are the leaders you know if you were pre-internet days maybe old people were leaders but in the internet and technology and we have three days young people are the leaders and that is very cool so for me i'm here to learn i am here to to join the community and and do good things one step at a time try not to mess it up and i mean as we all know we're playing with fire in many ways but but if we do good things and and be very very thoughtful we are going to have a wonderful uh we meaning web3 community are going to have a wonderful positive impact on the world yeah that'd be beautiful i mean i guess you know do you have any advice for any of the regen web 3 people out there how do we build this into a movement i mean i would love it if in the next three years regen web 3 and impact owls were what the public knew about with respect to web three and we could sort of subsume the more speculative uses of this technology and create more of that object level impact on everyday humans like do you have any advice for someone for us as as we're trying to engineer this movement and whip up that action yeah i definitely first of all i have a view on speculation that is maybe not as bad as other people where you know it serves a role right so uh i'm in this space because i believe it adds a lot of value to the world you're in the space for the same reason anyone who's working on a on a giving dao or a philanthropic dollar an impact out is doing it because they want to make a positive impact on the world but the specular speculators also bring a lot of capital to the table so we're not here to i'm not here to knock those guys but the um the the thing that i would really recommend which again comes back to community is to learn from the other other giving down so in the case of git coin we have learned that big green down we cannot thank you enough for being so open and here to teach us how to do quadratic funding or credit voting or working with othello your recommendation on voting using a quadratic funding approach there is no way we would have come up with that by ourselves no way zero zero chance and so being able to leverage the learnings of other dows get to know them get to know get coin get to know big green dow uh get to uh i hope our voting is relatively public you can't vote of course unless you have a have a token but i believe it's public and so you can see how the voting is going you can read the white paper you can join the discord and learn learn from everyone and anyone because the more mistakes you can learn from other people the less you're going to make yourself right beautiful uh let's see kimball i think that that's that's probably about the end of the episode where can people find you online if they want to get involved in in the movement uh and how can they join big greendale so my twitter is at kimball k-i-m-b-a-l and uh there are two ways to join big green dow one is to make a donation there's no minimum donation to join the discord there's one ethereum minimum to be a voter and then if you're a non-profit you can join the discord without any charge at all and you just apply so please please do that if you are a impact hour or giving down out there that wants to learn from us i recommend you join the discord as a you know put donate a dollar and join in there and and if you get excited you think it works donate anything become a voter because man you will learn so much and uh we would also welcome you into our community beautiful so check out green built green big green dow everyone in kimball musk thanks so much for being on the pod thank you again kevin for all your help and thank you for having me on today [Music]
