monolith.xyz what up bankless nation we are here with anthony cesano anthony needs no introduction however i will do that anyways anthony is one of the few people who in addition to eric connor i consider ethereum's unofficial community manager anthony does a really good job being a steward of information around ethereum one of the co-founders of ethub and what the project that we are introducing today the daily gray anthony welcome to the nation hey david thank you for that very nice introduction and those very kind words uh great to be here excited to talk about you know everything i'm doing and maybe some other things later on as well yeah let's so let's dive right in why does the world need the daily guay oh well that's a good question uh i think i mean if we take it back to first principles what the daily way is is basically an education platform so started as a newsletter where i kind of write every day about ethereum about the biggest things happening in ethereum with the goal to basically teach uh you know people's at least one thing new about ethereum every day and that's that's kind of like been my overarching goal with that and then recently i launched uh kind of an ecosystem around the daily gray where i'm doing a youtube kind of channel where i do daily updates on ethereum like what's happened during the day to make sure people are educated there and to give them context around things that are happening because what i noticed is that a lot of things happen people tweet about it right but unless you're like super in the weeds it's very hard to get context around why it's important you know why you should be excited about it and you know how you should feel about it basically so that's kind of what i've done there and i also plan to do more you know educational materials for for not so much the people that are hardcore ethereum but like the newer people because i think as we're going into kind of this bull market we're going to get tons of new people coming in and i want to make sure they have the right information in front of them because there's a lot of there's a lot of bad information out there unfortunately that's just the nature of the space so that's kind of what my aim is with with the youtube channel there yeah it's coming into the world of crypto is uh to use a metaphor that's that's very favorable in the crypto world uh a dark forest right there is there's no path right there's no crypto university there are barely any like crypto classes that people take there's no like academic path like this is how you learn about this it's always like it's every man for himself when it comes to learning about crypto and that's what makes it so hard hey there's like so much to learn about and b like finding the right sources in crypto to learn about crypto is extremely difficult because you don't know how to vet sources at the when you are just getting into the world of crypto and so like uh what what we do at bank list and what i see you you doing at the daily grade is like we like trying to be like a teacher like we are leading a classroom except the classroom is like you know your youtube or your newsletter um so talk about the importance of just capturing the attention of people coming into the space and why why it's beneficial if like they land on something like you know the daily grave versus some like you know pumpamento's youtube channel yeah yeah so i think it's extremely important that people don't fall into the wrong kind of echo chambers right and it's very easy to because as you said there's no defined path right there's no one telling you like you know in real life you go to primary school you go to secondary school you go to college university whatever then you go get a job right that's like a defined path and you know that from when you're a little kid basically uh whereas with crypto you you could come in in various different ways right you can get started on reddit you can get started on twitter you can get started on youtube you know wherever you get your first kind of sense right you know imagine you just heard about ethereum you type into google what is ethereum and you come up with with all these different things and you go searching and then you slowly you know learn more and more but it depends on what sources you're learning from so you know unfortunately a lot of the stuff on youtube is is kind of that like pumpy you know chilly stuff where people like to pump some coins and things like that which uh you know i mean there might be a need for that and people enjoy watching that but i think a lot of it is unfortunately uh not great from an education perspective uh and it maybe puts people into the wrong mindset of like this is just a casino where you you know you gamble and and none of the tech matters or whatever so you know the counterbalance to that is is is stuff like you know bankless uh the delegate ethub you know d5 does a lot of really cool d5 tutorials uh and on yieldtv as well so uh you know we we we kind of need that counterbalance or else people are just going to go and and and and kind of watch these these things and then get a wrong impression like especially because you know i mean we all know that there's a there's there's cohorts of people out there who love to spread misinformation about various projects to bet to benefit their own agenda so you know we need to kind of counterbalance that with with great information with accurate information and that's what i'm trying to do i mean that's what you and ryan are trying to do right and that's what you know i think a lot of the the people in the ethereum ecosystem in the weeds are trying to do but unfortunately you know our reach can sometimes not be as as grand as these other people so we're you know i'm just trying to to grow the i guess the pie and grow the reach there yeah if you go to youtube and type in like what is ethereum the list of accounts that show up or or like videos that show up is like if you are somebody who's interested in the success of ethereum you don't like that list of videos like the videos that pro that come up first are need to be replaced and one thing i'm really bullish on in 2020 is ethereum media back in 2017 we didn't have ethereum media there was no ethereum media there was no one producing content specifically about ethereum and the ethereum ecosystem so this is going to be like the first bull run where there's actually people like you putting out youtube content putting out newsletter content that's actually producing media content that isn't just like you know watching the charts and just like is this coin going to pump here's some news that's going to pump this coin like blah blah blah like it it's really legitimizing that ethereum media is always is here and it's also i think going to be further legitimizing when a bunch of new people come into this space so anthony let's talk about like what kind of content do you think that you are going to like focus in on or specialize in on that that you are doing with your your daily grey refills refuels which i'm thoroughly enjoying by the way uh like what what could uh people expect to to hear from from the daily quiet yeah so i guess we were talking about this a little bit off air uh kind of like the plants for the channel i think the daily great refuels were easy to start with because you know it's just kind of me saving some some things to talk about during the day and then and then recording myself talking to them because i already have all the context and knowledge around it that i can that i can put out there but i do want to extend past that i want to do kind of more i guess you call them structured educational videos where i go from like first principles go from like zero basically and get this person up to like one right so they go from like not understanding this particular subject at all to having like a really great understanding of it towards the end of the video and that's actually really hard to do right because you know i've been trying and making vid making scripts and and slides slide decks for it and everything and you know i put content on there i'm just from like my brain and then i look back on it and i'm like wow i need to actually explain all of this stuff first before i get to this point and that's another issue with i think uh with with new people coming into this ecosystem is that it can be very complex and the people that that that are the smartest within the ecosystem and have the most knowledge it can be hard for them to to kind of like go back to first principles as well because the space moves so fast you know unless you're keeping up with it every day you know you can get left behind so i'm trying i'm i'm trying really hard to make sure that the educational content that i put out there is easy for like a brand new person to understand right and then uh also for them to kind of like you know increase their knowledge on their own too without me having to kind of hold their hand but having that framework to work from like i don't want them you know i mean you you mentioned that like when you search what is ethereum on youtube you get these old videos that basically describe ethereum as it was like maybe a couple years ago and you don't even hear about things like d5 right the main use case for ethereum so i want to kind of make videos that are kind of not timeless but like don't age as horribly as these other ones have and you know those people who made these videos they weren't ill-intentioned ill-intentioned or anything but the problem is is that because the space moves so fast you know that's just like old information now absolutely and and i i see the content that i that is coming out of the daily way here here's how i have it like meant uh modeled out mentally so so correct me if i'm wrong but like i kind of think of it as like the a barbell type of content where like you have you're going to make some really easy beginners type content but then you also have your daily refuels and if it to put to use an analogy of like learning a language this is like you know uh spanish 101 like donde esta la biblioteca and then the daily refuels are like fluent spanish where you just like throw someone into the middle of it you don't you don't give any explanation because there's no time for that but like you that's like the 401 level content and like to some degree the only way to learn about crypto is to take the really complicated stuff and like slam your head against it like a bunch of times right and so like i feel like you know having a bunch of beginners content where like you hold their hand and then you have like this fluent like here's what happened in the ecosystem here's what happened today here's like all the things that like are important vetted by anthony you know like you know uh curated by anthony and then you kind of can go balance back and forth between those two things and bounce back between these two ends of the barbell to bring someone into like you know a quote unquote like university level understanding understanding of crypto yeah exactly and you know every individual is different right some people learn uh like that like getting blasted with information and then picking it apart they're on their own and going and researching further i'm personally one of those learners right i mean you know that's how i basically came into ethereum you know especially you know in when i discovered in early 2017 as you said there's none of there was none of this media there was no way really to start you were just thrown into like a million blog posts that you had to read right and there you know it wasn't just like uh the content from 2017 but also the older content to get context around things so there's those types of people there's other people who want to just that basically their hand to be held through the whole thing which i think is is fine and and that's that's a fine way to learn but those people are definitely the ones that i i want to try and capture because as you mentioned the the daily great refuel fills that hole for people who are just like want to be blasted with all this information with no context just like you know a stream of consciousness basically from me whereas i want to appeal to those people who want their you know to go from like spanish 101 to 401 you know and all the steps to get there not just uh having to go into the deep end sort of thing yeah so in in addition to uh the youtube uh channel what else is the daily guy because it's a it's an ecosystem right it's not just a youtube yeah exactly so you know as i mentioned we have the daily newsletter which again is for people that are kind of like in the weeds as well it's not a beginner's thing i try to to keep it like higher level and not go too technical with it but it's definitely going to appeal more to people that are already in the ecosystem there's also a discord channel where you know you can jump in there and you can ask questions to people you know you can you can ask me questions and i'll try my best to explain explain it as well because i think having that one-on-one support or that one-to-many support within the community is extremely important especially you know in discord or something where we have different channels for different topics so you know conversations don't get lost you can get help from people because the best thing that the ethereum community the story that ethereum has is the community right there are so many helpful people that will give you the answer will link you to the right places uh you know and and as long as there's content exists for that they'll they'll do it if there's no content they'll just create it themselves right uh and they'll explain it in their own words so yeah those are like the two main things well the three main things sorry the discord the youtube and the daily newsletter uh there's also a twitter account but that just serves as a purpose to like amplify the the messages as well um and yeah i mean i'm also doing similar things with ether right where we have the documentation section of ether that's got a bunch of beginner stuff on there as well the the weekly podcast with eric where we basically recap the week as well there so it's always good to get eric's context on things as well like bouncing off another person is always great um yeah so there's a fair fair bit going on but as i said i think you know a lot of it's right now is focused on the people already in ethereum i really want to get the the newbies and i really want to teach them how to how to get involved how to get to that point yeah and there's there's definitely an advantage to having having uh a network of media teams like ether bank list daily guay because like the chance that a new finds one of us is good decent at least one of us and then we can just shield the rest of us right there's gonna be like a network of just like ethereum media that's like here are the other trusted like news sources that you guys should go to and anthony i think we should go all the way back until like not all the way back but like the back into the bear market of like 2018 and 2019 because this is where like you and i got close together this is where like we started to like sharpen our messages about ethereum this is where like a lot of some of the ideas about ethereum and ether uh that had that we are now finally seeing bubble up to the surface like a lot of those original ideas came out of the bear market right like eath wasn't money in 2017 like that wasn't really a conversation that we had like we didn't have uh you know conversations about ether as a bond or as a triple point asset or as ethereum as like a native economy let's talk about like your perceptions as to like how these conversations why it's so super important to a have these conversations and then like why it's also important for ethereum media to exist to get these messages like up to the surface explain that thought process and your thoughts around it yeah yeah so for those who weren't around in the earlier days if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the urn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stable coin and wire will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at why earn dot finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing so for those who weren't around in the earlier days in 2017 and things like that eth as a financial asset was not a conversation at all basically um the narrative around eth was that it was used for gas and it would never accrue any value right and then we obviously saw what happened during 2017 with the the huge run up in eth uh and again but that was mostly driven by icos right people still weren't bought into this narrative that it could be anything but like a payment not a payment token like a token to to pay for gas in transparency yeah transactional token um so you know whereas you had bitcoin on the other end where everyone was kind of bought into this idea that well most people that bitcoin was like the store of value digital gold thing and that wasn't any like that wasn't in the conversation you mentioned that and you were laughed out of the room basically and then obviously after 2017 we had the bear market in 18 and 19 where these narratives started to kind of bubble up right because the only people that were left in 2018 and 2019 were the hardcore ethereum believers right and obviously those those people had you know a lot of eth and wanted to you know wanted that eth to appreciate so you know how do we position ethers like a financial asset how do we describe to people that if is more than just being paid for for for fees and things like that and you know i think a lot of people in that space has played a huge part like i think that yourself and ryan uh myself uh eric like you know a bunch of us we played like a a pivotal part in basically setting the narratives around it and you know it's come to the point now where you have eighth being viewed as this financial asset on par with bitcoin you know there's that meme of like blue chip cryptos uh you know and that's what it is right whenever someone mentions btc they mention ether as well now right there are traditional finance folks who say i'm allocating you know 80 to bitcoin 20 to 8 you know yes it's still heavy bitcoin but that would have been negative or like zero percent right that wouldn't even be in their mind space back in 2017 uh and be and before that so the fact that those narratives that were set in 2018 and 2019 have bubbled up now and are actually part of the mainstream consciousness and not just within crypto but outside of crypto is a huge achievement i think and that's probably the thing that i'm most proud of uh out of the bear market like i stuck around i put out all this content i did all this stuff the thing i'm most proud of is basically positioning eth as you know being part of the team or the no it's not really a team but like the the the cohort of people who pushed eth forward as an asset yeah the the if you actually put a team label on it the bitcoiners again it comes like i knew there was a team behind this no it's like no it was like you me eric connor ryan sean adams like dc investor you know all amplification from anti-pro but it was like the 2018-2019 bear market twitter accounts like with which like when we were bored because there was nothing to talk about we would make twitter threads about how like ethan's money from like a thousand different perspectives and like at that time like we didn't know if we were even right or not it just like made sense to us but and like we had some like fundamental arguments about why it was true but it never actually like we didn't really have significant proof until now like now we have proof that like defy collateral is primarily ether now we have proof that like if ether's like nativeness to ethereum makes it such a privileged and pristine asset inside of d5 now there's actually staking right and like now even though like previously like staking wasn't a thing like collateral in d5 was kind of a curiosity not really a big metric and then like the eip1559 wasn't even a thing until like 2019 right and and so like it used to be just this absence of community absence of messaging and that's where i think like the role of ethereum media really plays into it because the theory media i think was born in 2018 like especially with you and your twitter activities and your twitter twitter leadership um and you know eric and ryan's as well uh like that's where you know the daily grade was formed like that was the crucible the crucible of 2018 formed a lot of these efforts and like the the fact that like you know the missouri is like you know starting to beat the same drum that we were beating like two years ago uh i think it just proves out the point is like why ethereum media is important and so the point i'm trying to get to the point for the the listeners is hey you should go subscribe to the daily gray uh uh youtube because like the heart and soul of ethereum is coming out of the daily way right and so like there's a responsibility in uh promoting ethereum media companies that promote like the heart of ethereum right the ethos of ethereum and you know i'm pretty confident that anthony uh what the words about ethereum that come out of ethereum's uh that the words about ethereum that come out of anthony's mouths are actually spoken from ethereum the protocol itself in some weird mythological way that's that's that's yeah that's that's a fun way to put it um you know and i think just uh going back to your point around kind of the things that eth had and didn't have you know you're right eip1559 you know the eip to burn eighth uh didn't exist uh you know each issuance schedule and and and stuff around that like that wasn't even a thought in in even 2017 right people you know when when ethereum was first created it was basically you know you know we're just going to have this issuance we're going to pay out this much you know per block and it's going to be like this forever right uh there was no thought around it really and this is what happened in 2018 and stuff we solidified a narrative around the issuance and we came up with you know minimum minimum viable issuance or necessary issuance where we would have low perpetual issuance over time and then we would have fee burning as well so that eventually we can get to net negative issuance and secure the protocol at the same time and it's important to realize as well that staking was still kind of like a pipe dream in 1718 you know no one knew when it was going to come and there was some like big pivots that happened around the eth2 roadmap at the time as well so yeah for those who weren't around and and weren't in the weeds for all of 2018 and 2019 let me tell you it was a very different very unsure time period in ethereum it was a really goddamn slog it was a slog man like especially 2019 if you look at the eighth prize it basically ended the year like up like two percent where bitcoin ended it up like i think two times almost three times um off the bear market lows so yeah 2019 for me was the mo the hardest year because you know eighth price to me is a reflection of how successful ethereum is as a platform and whether you know for for better or worse that's how most people view it uh and then you know i'm putting out all this content and like you know seeing these prices do nothing and then people not get excited about it it was it was kind of disheartening uh and i'll be honest it was really hard to stick through it but you know i i obviously i'm very passionate about ethereum and so so you and and a few of the other people we know and that that people would know of um but yeah i just 2020 is just so different like even defy wasn't a thing 2017 wasn't really a thing in 2018 we had some some things popping up here and there right like you know uni swap and and make it down things but it was still a toy no one was taking it seriously no one thought it was gonna overtake centralized exchanges and things like that the only people who thought that were like the very very hardcore aetherians like you know like us and and it's very hard to beat a drum uh that you know when there's no one else kind of like dancing with you basically um but you know we got to 2020 and it's been a lot brighter right it's been a much better year for ethereum uh you know i think it's been best year in ethereum's history right we had the d5 explosion eth finally you know woke up and he's now back to a really great price we had e2 launch you know two days ago well the first phase of e2 launch you know we have so many things now that for me you know there were parts in 2019 where i was just like you know am i actually you know right here to to to dedicate so much time to ethereum whereas in 2020 i'm now basically like i know ethereum is going to be this huge thing for the world i have zero doubts uh it's gonna succeed and you know i'm more excited about it than ever yeah any etherean that is still in the ethereum community after the 2018-2019 bear market survived just like an onslaught two years of an onslaught of just like attacks on the narrative and gaslighting from bitcoiners and like like i'll be honest like i had this pov crypto podcast with my co-host christian there are definitely times where i'm like  do i like do i capitulate like but like the answer was no and like here we are today like almost everything that we stated like in 2018 and 2019 like was it has eventually like proven out in some way shape or form to be completely real and like i only expect that to continue and to be further than that right and like you're totally right about the eth price like like the only it's crazy to think like it's 20 20 and like dude the eath price used to be like 95 dollars in the depth of march like 95 dollars to like where it is now like a 600 and like it all it takes is like the eath price to like you know add on 50 100 150 and all of a sudden everything's like legitimate again right and so you know the people that were able to front run that opportunity and get their message out the door before before the the price rose is was now able to now able to say like told you so like got it right yeah exactly um you know it's it's just really funny when i think back on it because you're going to have lots of people coming in lots of new people and they're going to think that ethereum was always going to be the sure thing right right and i'm glad that they get to think that i'm glad that they don't have to go through lucky bastards yeah yeah what we went through but you know being an early adopter comes with rewards right um you know i i shouldn't be complaining too much uh sticking around has been has been very nice uh but you know it not just from like uh i guess like a financial perspective but also from like a personal growth perspective right i feel more fulfilled with my with my life than i ever have and that's because i stuck around and found something that i you know was passionate about um so but yeah in general i'm glad that we now have this ship on course you know it's this giant thing and and i don't see anything to be really bearish or negative about going forward for ethereum you know the fact that i mean people say oh the beacon chain launching is whatever it doesn't really do much i mean it's a it's a shelling point right it's a signal that we actually launched you know the first phase of e2 and e2 is gonna happen right it's not like it's a it's a dream anymore it's not like we're just doing test nets it's actually live on mainnet half a billion dollars almost the value is securing it you know it's it's happening so i yeah i mean as i said i have never been more excited about ethereum as i am today yeah yeah that's absolutely right and like the the 2018-2019 bear market was characterized as like trying to keep our heads above water right because like you know at some point like job security was was it was an issue right like you don't like you didn't know if you're the startup or the company that you were working for was gonna like call it quits in the next couple months and so like the fact that you are now able to like go full time on the daily way is a signal of the strength and the health and the beliefs in strength and health of the ethereum economy right because like if you if you were struggling to keep your head above water you wouldn't be going off on your own venture doing ethereum media and so it's it's both a signal to strength of the ethereum economy and also your commitment to ethereum that you're you're doing this whole daily gray thing yeah i mean ethereum's given me a lot over the years uh and i've tried to give back as much as i can and the daily grade is just another piece of that just giving back more and more making sure that i you know i don't feel like i i would debt to ethereum so to speak but i feel like i owe it to the community and to ethereum to spread what i know and my knowledge and to to you know help more people come on board with this kind of amazing thing we have here yeah it's not a debt but it's definitely a responsibility mm-hmm yeah exactly that's a good way to put it yeah anthony if people want to subscribe to the daily grade newsletter or go to the daily way youtube where should they go yeah so the newsletter is at thedailyguy. the youtube you can just type in the daily gray on the search bar and it'll come up come up there and then yeah you'll be able to find all the relevant links there as i said the daily newsletter goes out every weekday the youtube channel i do the same thing with the the refuel episodes which go out every weekday um and then i'll be having like more kind of like pointed educational
