hi everyone this is d5 dad i'm gonna walk you through a tutorial today on how you can earn uh yield as a market maker on curve finance and one of the pools actually in particular offers me the ability to earn lending interest as well so i'm going to focus on those two different dynamics how to earn yield by lending or basically holding interest earning tokens and then also the ability to make money off of market making fees so if i go to curve.phi uh at its core this is a stablecoin dex this is the ability to be able to trade between different stablecoins so you can see dye usdc tether trueusd binance usd synthetics usd and pax i can trade between any of these why would i do that well you know there's different utility to these stable coins depending on what markets you're looking at in d5 a good example is last week there was at one point i think there was a 10 to 18 percent uh interest that was being earned on tether and so if i start out with usdc and i want to get tether i can go here and let's say trade 1000 usdc for 998 tether so the rate is almost one to one and that's what's really powerful about curve finances one-to-one exchange rates between stable coins little slippage uh and you know whatever would arguably be the best rate that you can possibly get okay so uh on the other side of this equation is what's referred to as liquidity providers so this is someone who is willing to deposit their stable coins into curve and allow traders to trade between them and to earn the percentage that's paid for each trade as they do these swaps between let's say die and usdc and usdc and tether and so on so i can come here and i can deposit 100 die i will end up then with a certain share of the pool you can see here on the left hand side that there are four different coins in this pool the pool in total has almost 14 million in stable coins but there isn't an even distribution because there's different demand for these different stable coins so die there's only four point five seven percent versus uh tether has thirty four point five five percent uh also this reflects uh different amounts of liquidity for these different stable coins on the ethereum network and and i would say tether is the most liquid stable coin at this point but die also is uh always in demand so it's no surprise here that die is the smallest portion of the pool so uh here on the right hand side you can see my own share of the pool and this reflects the percentages over here on the left but i currently have uh 1526 actually i guess a better number here's 1 527 worth of stable coins and the split between them represents the percentages you see on the left in the pool so i own 0.01 1 of the pool which means i have about 70 die about 594 usdc about 527 tether and about 334 true usd i have the ability to withdraw my share of the pool at any time uh so you know what's what's cool here is i mean i can earn yield on these stable coins which is essentially a market maker fee and i can withdraw it when i want okay so now that i understand how curve finance works and how i can earn fees as a market maker and potentially as a lender if i'm holding interest-bearing tokens that are being you know traded in these pools i'm going to choose between compound pax y busd and susd those are the five different stable coin pools that i want to consider and rank which one is going to be worth me depositing my stable coins into the way i'm going to do it is i'm going to think about what are the tokens that are in each one of the pools so in this case the compound.curve.5 pool has die in usdc so it's only die in usdc versus other stable coins the other way i'm going to do it is consider what is the apy annualized percentage yield that could be from the pool having started which in this case for compound.curve.phi started around february 27th so that annualized percentage yield over the course of that many months with it being now june uh folks have averaged 5.37 percent as a return if it were annualized i'm also going to consider the other numbers here like uh what is the weekly apy what's the monthly apy just because it gives me a sense of whether or not some of these pools have been doing better or worse okay so the first pool compound.curve.phi it's just dying usdc i'm good with that the uh the annualized percentage yield is 5.37 percent i mean without anything to compare it to that sounds fine it's also a lot more than what my bank pays me next up i'm going to look at the usdt.curve 5 pool so this is a pool where it is 6.44 is the annualized percentage yield since about since about february 11th so a little bit better than the other pool but i have to be willing to have exposure to tether so it's dye usdc and tether let's assume i'm okay with that i'm willing to have exposure to tether and hence the higher percentage yield i think wins out here also the weekly apy so the apy according to the yields that were being averaged last week was 16.66 percent up above here it was around 15.46 percent so they're pretty even no big difference here then we go to the y pool the recent weekly apy was 60.33 so this is much larger this pool has been around since about the same time early early to mid february uh let's see what else the total apy is 11 so that was compared to the five and six percent and this pool means that i have to have exposure to die usdc tether and true usd this one to me so far is the clear winner and this is a pool that i actually lend my stable coins to regularly so i'm happy with that then there's the busd curve pool this is a newer pool that started actually no not that much newer it's february 28th but uh let's see the annualized percentage yield since then is 10.79 percent that's pretty pretty close to the uh the y pool so that's really competitive last week it was around 30 so that's half of the y pool so no doubt last week the y pool was getting more trading volume and performing better uh in general for earning market making returns so i guess considering all of that i guess recent monthly apy is 10.43 percent up above it's 16.22 so i'm gonna i'm gonna definitely continue to rank the live pool as my top choice and then the last one here is the synthetics usd pool this one has exposure to dye usdc tether and synthetic us dollar oh one other thing in the other pool that we just looked at with binance dollar you had to be willing to have exposure to that finance usd so that's the finance digital dollar type token and again maybe someone doesn't want exposure to that and if they don't that eliminates that pull for me because i don't want exposure or to ever let's say touch one of these tokens so back to the synthetics pool i have to want exposure to die usdc tether and the synthetics us dollar and if i'm okay with that this is a newer pool it started around april 21st the weekly apy last week was very high so 22 percent but that's lower than the 30 percent for the binance dollar lower than the 60 for the y pool and the recent monthly apy also is not as high as the ones that i found up above here oops here we go 10.43 percent on the finance dollar 16.22 percent on the y pool so yeah i'm going to go ahead and eliminate this however one thing that i'm leaving out of the equation this synthetics usd curve pool there are additional returns that are yield farming or whatever you want to call it lp rewards that synthetics offers so if i were to do this i can take i can take the tokens i receive for being a liquidity provider and i can stake them with synthetics at minter.synthetics.io and i will earn additional like rewards or funds from from having done that so to keep it simple today i am going to go ahead and work with the y pool so let's go ahead and move on to that next step of how do i deposit my stable coins into the y.curve.5 pool all right i'm ready to start earning uh with curve and i'm going to deposit my my die into the curve pool so you'll notice here uh what i've done is below i'm not worried about adding all coins in a balanced proportion just because i don't have any tether true usd so normally it would if i were to do this it would require then that it would pull from my balance in my wallet and i don't have these so that's not an option using the maximum amount of coins available i could do that but i don't want to so i'm going to add 0 usdc and i'm going to add 100 die and then i don't want to put in an infinite approval infinite approval means that in the future i would not have to do two transactions here i wouldn't have to come back to this and give approval to move my tokens i can basically give an infinite approval it's not something that i think is is wise with defy applications because if somehow someone maliciously gained control of those smart contracts they would then be able to to drain my wallet of any of the let's say die tokens because i had given infinite approval so i'm only going to give approval to move 100 die and then depositing wrapped tokens i i have die if i had why die that's what's referred to as wrapped so most everyone is going to start out with just die so let's click deposit all right you'll notice i'm going to receive 96 curve iron lp tokens those are those are the tokens that i receive because i am lending my my tokens to uh curve and so uh the way that that normally works is you receive a token in exchange it's kind of like an iou and then in terms of my gas let's just check here so i am looking up on my phone eth gas station dot info and yeah it looks like i could get the transaction through if it was as little as 22 way so that's a smaller gas price actually maybe what i'll do is i'll just kick it up just to be safe we'll do 23 and we'll hit save okay so i'm spending as little eath as possible on this transaction and oh one last thing i'm giving permission to just move 100 die so i'm not doing the infinite approval just 100 die all right so my transaction has gone through to approve the 100 die being spent so i'm going to click deposit there we go so let's see i'm checking if dot i'm sorry eath gas station dot info on my phone one more time yep and it looks like 22.5 gway will be just fine uh let's see anything else to take into account um i think the the one thing to note here is just that i'm going to spend 0.03 gas so 0.03 eth that is equivalent 8.19 this is uh because gas prices are still high on ethereum that means that if if i'm depositing an amount of money like let's say 100 you know 100 die here if i anticipate earning less than eight died during the time frame i'm going to deposit this this doesn't make any sense and i should abandon this you know so you got to think about how long am i going to hold these tokens in in curve and how long am i going to have a time frame to earn and does that does that exceed what i'm paying in gas also does does it make sense in terms of the risk you know i'm putting up 100 die what if i need to withdraw that die for like a bill that i need to pay if that's the case this doesn't make a whole lot of sense but in my case it does make sense so i'm going to go ahead and push through this transaction all right here we go hit confirm okay so i'm back about 10 to 15 minutes later and my transaction went through so i've lent another 100 die into the curve pool and again that was the y pool so if we go here to the transaction you can see that i deposited 100 die that die was converted into y die and then that was actually split across uh why usdc why tether and why true usd and then what i walk away with is i i've got these curve.5 lp tokens so i've got 96.8 of those and that makes sense because each one of these lp tokens is worth interest plus the value of the original stable coins so they're each one of them is a little more valuable in other words so it makes sense that i would walk away with less than 100 of these and if i go back to curve dot phi slash iron slash deposit uh i can go below here to see my share of the pool has increased by just a little bit and i went from 1526 to 1626 in terms of usd balance so yeah those tokens are now in the pool i'm going to go ahead and earn with those in the future if i would like to withdraw these i can just go here to the withdrawal tab again that's curve dot phi iron slash withdraw and you can choose to withdraw whatever percentage you'd like another thing is that so this is newer to the the curve pool is you have the option to withdraw in whatever combination you'd like so i could uh i could just this is standard to go ahead and withdraw all of these tokens and i would i wouldn't pay any sort of like exchange fee because i'm withdrawing what is mine that is already in the pool however i could say let's go ahead and withdraw it all in die or let's withdraw it in usdc and then i can choose what percentage of that liquidity i want to draw it's very flexible you know i could say hey let's withdraw 50 of my liquidity we'll leave the rest of it and i'm going to withdraw it in usdc or i'll withdraw it and die and that's it i just i would click withdraw and that's that's how it works so you know that's that's the magic of these defy applications uh and being able to be in control of your assets and withdraw them whenever you want so that's really it i i hope this is really helpful i think this is one of my favorite defy apps to use just because the risk for me is limited to smart contract bugs so i could potentially buy smart contract cover on something like nexus mutual.io the the thing about smart contract bugs is i mean no matter what audits there are it's it's something that i always live with the fact that this is the number one risk that i have to worry about because if someone suddenly could drain if someone finds a bug and that bug let's say allows funds to be drained i mean that's putting at risk all of my funds okay so there's that and then uh the other thing is the the peg for these stable coins if that were to fail that would create a lot of chaos for me uh i could see if the peg failed let's say on any one of these i would imagine that people would be trading these stable coins to the other ones that had not failed and so it would be like a race against time to get your coins out and to get your coins into the coin that was not failing or you know is causing all this chaos so those are those are the two top things i think about and i consider those before i ever deposit any of my own money and whether or not i'm willing to risk that capital okay i hope this is helpful let me know if you have any questions and have a great day you
