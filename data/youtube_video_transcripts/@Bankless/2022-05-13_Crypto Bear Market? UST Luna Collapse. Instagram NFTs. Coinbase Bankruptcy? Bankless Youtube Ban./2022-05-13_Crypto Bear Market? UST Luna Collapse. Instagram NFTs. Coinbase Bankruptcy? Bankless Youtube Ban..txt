bankless nation is the second week of may oh my god david what a week it has been i didn't even get to what this is this is the roll-up that you're listening to okay what do we do on the show david uh we recap the news in crypto which ryan i say is always an ambitious endeavor i don't know if we're gonna make it this week like man oh my god dude this is this is the craziest week i've ever been in crypto like i could say that and there have been many crazy weeks but we just watched a how how big was luna at the outside of this it combined about 50 50 billion dollars combined in just like three days time four days time i don't know it felt like a year but it was actually like three days time we watched that 50 billion dollar thing go from 50 to zero zero yeah you know how we talk about uh crypto speed running the history of money and finance well we just span right sp speed ran the weimar republic hyperinflation event that's what we just did i mean yeah and it's crazy and look guys we're gonna get into uh into all of that and of course a lot of people lost a lot of money which is no no laughing matter uh and we do have sympathy for the folks that lost money i think this is definitely a time to reflect in the crypto ecosystem so uh and we've said before it's not about gloating it's about reflecting on what's happened and learning and so we actually did an entire episode on this david that we that we put on the podcast so we're we're just going to do the teas in today's episode we're going to talk about the crash of the luna ecosystem but if you want more go go tap into that episode that we just released yesterday yeah we're going to go and try and do the luna thing in under 10 minutes but the episode itself is 50 uh 50 minutes for the full deep dive into the whole entire ecosystem there is a little bit extra information that has happened in the last 24 hours that we will cover but in addition to all of that stuff there's also coinbase bankruptcy fears question mark uh should you be concerned uh tldr the answer is no at least in my opinion but we'll cover as to why people have those fears uh also ryan this is the same week that the bankless youtube got banned i don't know if you remember that it seems it seems like it happened forever ago and then of course instagram adding nfts uh and so you know some bad news some also some very good news um and then of course some funds blowing up which is kind of how you kind of know that we're close to the bottom is when funds start blowing up um that is the that's what we're going to talk about amongst you know what the the instagram thing alone that would have been the headline this week and that happened on monday and it got completely overshadowed okay so instagram adding nfts how big is that facebook 2.9 billion people in in the meta facebook instagram social network they just added nfts it's absolutely gigantic but it all got overshadowed of course we'll get to all of these things before we get there i want to talk a little bit about opolis these guys are awesome okay so opolis provides health insurance payroll benefits everything you need to be a self-sovereign employee that means you can work for a doubt you know how david and i are always saying in these rollups hey go quit your corporate job it's probably boring come join us in crypto we talk about the job opportunities this is a tool for how you do that because your big question if you're quitting your job is okay what about health insurance at least if you live in the u.s that is like one of the top three questions opolis solves that problem david what do they get if they become an opolis member by the end of may i think it's may 25th is the 25th yeah you get you get tokens and we all like tokens right opulence they have their own native token and that is a reward for signing up and being a part of the opolis dial you get a thousand work tokens plus you also get a thousand bank tokens because a lot of bankless dow members are also opposed customers so there's a partnership there thousand work tokens thousand bank tokens when you sign up with opolis by may 25th there is a link in the show notes bankless dot cc slash opolis with a capital o at the start uh to get your tokens amazing all right david let's get into markets um man what a bearish week this was yeah in addition to all the other stuff i you know uh the reason i'm laughing is because we've been through this before and i'm not worried long term at all about crypto but what is the short term bitcoin price telling us on the seven day david the bitcoin started the week at thirty nine thousand dollars uh and it bottomed yesterday last night at twenty six thousand dollars yeah 39 to 26. down 36 down to the very bottom on the week uh it's recovered since then we are currently at 29 400 at the time of recording uh down 27 on the week but yeah the bottom the bottom of the week was down 36 percent a single week do you know when we get in the 20s like do you remember the top in like 2017 david big like 20 20 000 yeah 19. oh yeah that's a great and it briefly flashed up to 20 000 that was like a miracle we're getting close to that we're getting close to the like the all-time high the last uh bear bull cycle incredible overall bitcoin from the top of the the more recent top of i think like 69 000 nice uh 62 percent we're down 62 from the ver from the very very peak to the very bottom how about eth is that telling uh a different story similar story yeah started the week at 2 900 bottoms last night at 1700 that's wednesday night we always record this thursday morning uh so uh down 31 on the week at the bottom last night it was down 42 uh currently clocking in at just uh almost two thousand dollars down 65 percent from the top ryan 65 and what was our what was our top in the 2017-2018 cycle what number was that david i know it's 14 in your heart 14.40 okay i mean we're getting close right when you get to the 1000 to 2000 range you're starting to get close nowhere near the bottom of that cycle which is like 80 each we're not going to 80 dollars we're not going to eighty dollars i don't think that they are buying 80 eth you are absolutely delusional i think it's hard to imagine a world where we get to triple digit eath yes i would agree the 1000 range we could range here for a while i don't know look triple digit eth could happen who knows anything can happen in crypto that would that would really surprise me but uh we'll see what happens how about the ratio i wonder what story that's telling us ratio was holding up really really good except for yesterday it plummeted at point zero seven five down to point zero six eight uh so it took a steep nose dive which is a very unfortunate cause i actually took a long ratio position literally yesterday i'm sorry man four went out for david four went out for me there's a lot of people who need some support on the in the markets this week so if you don't laugh you'll cry yeah let it be known that uh while we're all smiles and and and joking here like oh yeah no like uh we're down big too uh there's just tears inside guys we've just the difference between us and a lot of others other people is like we've done we've been here before yeah like i was serious and sad last last cycle same same and so like you know this time i i i know how to take it on the chin people are gonna be like watching this and be like you guys sounded so giddy what like why what's wrong with short heath what did you do i was like i would never short either okay but we're down bad just like you all right guys it's just if you don't laugh you'll cry and uh this is a temporary thing so now when i say temporary we don't know how long the temporary could be it could be months i mean we've gone through years before too what about the total global crypto market cap david yeah uh i i didn't look at the numbers for the last week but it's bad uh overall oh wait no i did oh my god i thought that was the top from the top last week we started we started last week at 1.9 trillion we are down to 1.3 trillion we lost 600 billion dollars in total market cap 600 billion of wealth destroyed so that's like individual wealth fund wealth like oh like all the wealth all the crypto wealth 600 billion dollars you could round that up to close-ish to a trillion i mean it's not a trillion it's like a trillion over the last like month or so a trillion dollars of capital destroyed 32 the total crypto market cap down 32 this week yikes that is painful uh all right speaking of pain let's get to the fed watch because i mean i think some people are blaming macro conditions in the fed for some of these events and the fed just released inflation numbers actually not not the fed who this is the consumer price index it's all tied together because the fed is obviously watching these numbers the fed consumes these numbers yeah they do they consume they set monetary policy at least partially based on them the march cpi consumer price index was eight point five percent year over year the april that was just last month was eight point three percent so slight down but also over what was expected yeah uh well slight down from march uh so march was eight point five percent and april's eight point three percent so slight down but above what was expected what was expected was 8.1 percent so i don't know what the market did with that i guess just more coughing up blood right um yeah wasn't super favorable the take from ralph paul which i think makes a ton of sense is that like the the uh crypto markets the equity markets all markets are just down like down down down uh tech stocks are wrecked and this is largely where a lot of inflation came from in the first place is assets going up and then a lot of people just start buying stuff because they're rich all those people are no longer buying stuff because they lost all the money uh and so the demand is killed uh but the thing is like ralph thinks that ralph paul thinks is that demand is already dead but it's gonna take a while for that to show up in the cpi numbers it's lagging it's a lagging indicator and so like he thinks that like there's already the case for the fed to stop being like stop punching the crap out of the market and start to being a little looser but it's going to take a while for those numbers to actually show up in cpi uh meanwhile they're keep on uh they keep on punching the market right and so uh this is like this is like a remember that world war one movie in like 1917 or something where like yeah already the war was already over but they hadn't heard about it yet and so this guy had to go to the generals to say hey don't invade the war is over but like yeah so this is like that like the it's over but like it news has to like proliferate to the fed first it is a take is it take that would be a hopeful prediction and the reason we know that's raul paul's take is because we spent 90 minutes with him earlier this week that episode is going to release on monday it's our title subscribers yes it is if you're a premium subscriber if you're not you should go get it because you can download it now but that episode is entitled should we be scared and raul paul goes through maybe some reasons we should be scared across the market but also how this market's going to turn around and the tldr as david said is he actually thinks the high cpi has already been painted and we're now going to be lower from here then he anticipates the bonds will start turning around then he anticipates the fed will start kicking the crap out of the market and the pain will stop and ultimately this is a really interesting prediction everyone's going to get another stimulus he thinks that he thinks the world governments are going to actually inject cash back into their respective economies through like direct deposits and this sort of thing so anyway stay tuned for that episode it is uh here if you're a premium subscriber if not that's coming out on monday uh david what does this mean for alternative layer ones oof well i mean they're all kind of down bad they're down bad the most just like you know first first cycle things always get hit the hardest ryan so the all the alt layer ones are down way worse than the rest of the market uh for example let's start with cardano down 65 percent down 84 all-time high down solana down 81 from all-time high polka dot down 83 from all-time high avalanche down 78 from all-time high we don't even have luna on this thing because luna is literally down 100 as percent there are plenty of zombie chains out there like eos for example eos is only down 95 from all-time high we have never seen something go down at 99 i have never seen a top don't luna was a top 10 crypto asset right right bigly yeah and this all happened in a week last week yeah we'll talk about that what does this chart look like this is just like chart gore oh it's a straight line down oh my god there's a straight line down look at it yeah yeah it's like it's looking at a train wreck you can't look away in stark contrast not not that stark but you know decently bitcoin is down 56 percent ethereum ether down 58 percent uh this is uh for a lot of reasons again newer stuff gets hit harder uh but also like the the newer holders are also they just get scared more right like bitcoin and ether they have holders that have gone through a bear market uh and so this is mostly to be expected all like there's always a flight to safety in bear market so things at the bottom of the crypto market cap like list work their way up towards the top um and and it's actually nice it's interesting to see ether not down much worse than bitcoin uh last year or last cycle i mean it was down way more than bitcoin just because it was the first cycle um so yeah i i have a take about this too i actually think that um the death of of luna this week everything that went on really marks the end of the alternative layer 1 trade that has been a super super popular trade almost throughout all of 2021 and lasting up until now but i think the death of luna sort of kills it for a lot of people because there are some underlying systemic risks in many of these alternative layer ones that haven't really been priced in or factored in and what i think we're going to see in the next kind of narrative play is actually a return to some fundamentals and rotators will rotate into the next narrative as well and if the next narrative is stronger fundamentals i don't think they're going to be flying into bitcoin so much they're going to of course because that is the ultimate safety asset and crypto at least that's perception i think they're going to be coming to ethereum and then later to layer twos and uh i mean we've made this case many times on bank list but there are just so many catalysts coming up for for ethereum and layer twos the merge is one go listen to our merge episode that we dropped with hal press earlier this week incredibly bullish episode just supply and dime demand dynamics also security right it's like ethereum securities super tried and tested what we saw in the collapse of luna is not just the entire economy turned into the weimer republic we saw all of its military all of its security degraded in basically a 24 to 48 uh hour period of time now can be attacked by like a few dollars if you have it um layer two tokens are coming that's been a narrative we've got strong staking returns so it's really going to be the market the rotators are going to choose well should i rotate they'll rotate of course into fiat for a while into us dollars but then they'll come back and they'll say okay what's gonna what's gonna cr you know return fastest in crypto is it going to be ether bitcoin and i would put my money on ether because it has d5 it has nfts and it has killer economics coming up especially post merge yeah and also let's take a moment to reflect on the state of the alt-layer ones right now like uh luna did the first thing of the crypto market ever and went down uh basically a hundred percent because of the hyperinflation of the luna token because of the algo stable coin solana went down for seven hours again for like the sixth or seventh time i don't know not down in price you mean an outage an outage the blockchain went out right and and so like now there's the joke of like salon is only open for business hours uh the avalanche c chain is going up the the gas fees are going up which is like their big claim to innovation is that like the avalanche is the low low fee chain but it's not and they also are doing their scaling via like subnets but that's really just like off-brand sharding with fractured security so that's not gonna work tara already talked about tara phantom also blew up as soon as entree just left that that ecosystem's down bigly and so like almost all of the predictions that the ethereum camp made about the compromises that these alt layer ones uh have made have started to come true in the last like three months you know i'll add another one to the pile which near which is interesting some interesting tech there of course too but uh they were going in the direction of just kind of copying tara yeah they're launching and we're gonna copy the algo stable coin probably a bad idea like it's like wrong timing jonah hill like ugh not right now i mean the reason why ethereum has made the choice is that it's made yes and we're not saying alternative layer ones will never come back i'm sure they'll have another season another narrative but i do think that this week is going to change the narrative and of course david and i we play narratives a little bit but not too much we're more interested in the fundamentals but i think that's it the new narrative is fundamentals at least for some period of time it always is in the bear market and while we go into like the layer two season we're going into layer two season during a bear market so i don't really think like it's gonna be hard for the layer two season to like completely change it i don't really think that's gonna happen yes but what is going to happen ryan is layer two season is going to be a builder's bull market as in stuff is going to be built and it's not going to be reflected in price and that is your opportunity listener uh this is uh uh the opportunity to take the bull by the horns during the bear market is so strong if you just pay attention to fundamentals yeah absolutely and i don't want to go over predictor here but i actually think while we're in a bear market it's obviously confirmed by the price action i don't think this one is going to be as prolonged david no way to know that no way to tell i feel like this is the sort of thing that's going to be it's going to take your breath away it's like you know going on a roller coaster right you're just going down that big dip it's going to take your breath away it's going to be sharp it's going to be severe but it's also going to be fast at least a lot faster than previous bear cycles again that's just kind of a feeling based on where uh what i'm seeing in the market but this does not feel like a multi-year long winter that where that that lies ahead for us but the chances that the bottom is already in and i would say is pretty significant there you go i yes we'll see i think we could go further down but it just won't be as long as probably my take but let's let's talk about that as possible to be honest i mean the last time it got a little long david it was like yeah during the cove are we right i was like god damn we're going to do another for another year yes uh let's talk about coin coinbase also bear markets yeah so what did they do they just released their earnings report they are down down from 1.1 billion in q1 2021 to 20 million 1.1 billion to 20 million so that's a steep drop i think the tl dr has some big hiring there's some bear market impact um but what's crazy about this david is the p e ratio of coinbase you know what that is right now tell me four point six oh god okay well we're averaging either isn't that lower than ether right now it's really low okay it depends how you measure p e for ether but like the average for the s p is about 20 right now wow it is 4.6 dude things are so oversold the coin price is that like i don't know it was like something like 90 or 80 dollars went big down bigly after after earnings it's been going down ever since it listed at like 400 something dollars it's so cheap is like 14 billion right now 14 billion dollar market cap right now uh it's absolutely blowing my mind as well now they did do a lot of hiring i don't know how efficient that was but um i mean that p e ratio is just like crazy to me uh so maybe we're in oversold territory uh guys we got a lot to cover what are we gonna cover next right we're gonna speed run the ust debacle the usd demise terra demise uh and we're gonna talk about the the instagram nfts we're gonna talk about how bank this got cancelled but we're

robbing about at governance.ave.com all right guys we're back we gotta start here ust luna terra the biggest collapse in crypto history david what are we looking at in this chart yeah this is the the ust chart for its trading for tethers uh you can see it start to wobble on the 8th of may but it picked itself back up again but halfway through the 9th of may it dropped down to 75 cents recovered up to 90 cents uh but then shortly thereafter it dropped all the way down to 30 cents uh to where we are today at 46 cents i'm pretty sure we are actually lower at this current moment but this is this is the usc stable coin out of the terra ecosystem losing its peg bigly going down bigly uh and you might be asking why are why is it not down to zero if the whole thing is collapsed well that's because luna collapsed on its behalf luna is minted in order to redeem a ust so you can in order to get one dollar worth of if you have one dollar one ust you can get one dollars worth of luna because it will mint the luna to make you whole then you can go to the secondary market and sell all your luna to get your dollar back so luna has been hyperinflating and it went from where during this whole thing it started about 85 it is now currently below a single penny zero zero seven cents uh because it just hyperinflated because the peg became unsustainable uh the peg got attacked by an attacker who was very well capitalized that attacker made out with almost a billion dollars causing a bunch of fear so people tried to exit there wasn't enough liquidity for everyone to exit causing this hyperinflation event uh so tara for the first ever token to actually go to zero in the crypto ecosystem look at this david so all of these gains were basically within the last year or so 2021 so people bought here they bought around i don't know 30 cents or so back in the beginning of 2021 uh and then they just experienced an over 120 x gain a massive gain thousands of percent yes thousands of percent uh and then uh they lost it all in a single week yep that's what happened i've never seen it like this yeah uh i mean the only other chart that we've seen do this is bit connect but that was a verified ponzi scheme that everyone knew was a ponzi scheme uh and so like that went to zero uh but that was in 2018 and that was uh at a 3.5 billion dollar valuation and i layered these two charts on top of each other and controlled it for time uh bitcoin x went from 3.5 billion dollar market gap down to zero luna was over 40 billion dollars at the peak uh so like the by far the craziest destruction of capital event in crypto history not even close yeah incredible guys uh we went through the full story of all of this if you're looking for all of the details we just did a 40 minute episode on it and we just launched that on wednesday so go check you youtube go download that on the podcast you want to hear the full story but what david and i are doing is giving you the latest update and doing the the quick summary right here and uh i understand one thing that's happened since we recorded that episode is the the terra blockchain has also been halted is that the case yeah that happened actually in the last five minutes or last five or ten minutes uh because of the the uh luna token is so cheap it's so cheap that people could just buy it up and start to become validators on the blockchain and then basically 51 the blockchain to death so they just said like yo this thing is dead it's over we're stopping the blockchain and letting whatever assets that uh are remain on the the blockchain to be redeemed there are tokens on there the tokens are also down bad um but yeah this is the first i've never seen a blockchain actually get stopped ryan this is not only have i never seen something go to zero i've never seen people actually turn off a blockchain it's usually a meme like the asset's gonna go to zero or it's gonna kill the blockchain and in this time it actually killed the blockchain the asset actually did go to zero pretty incredible um a lot of people were affected by this let's keep that in mind of course and again as we said earlier in the episode it's like even if you were right about tara uh this is an opportunity to reflect and not gloat uh but these are a lot of tweets of well-known people well-known investors in the crypto space who lost their net worth almost entirely this is the co-founder of real vision uh remy talking this is a a founder of delphi uh talking delphi labs um do you want to read some of these tweets uh yeah jose who's the one that we actually had on the podcast to talk about the bull he was the the tara bull uh and on the podcast he talked about how he was just extremely bullish on tara and he goes brutal like many others i lost most of my net worth here my heart goes out to all the other lunatics who are hurting many much worse than me if you are feeling down please get off crypto twitter and spend some times with family and people you love my dms are open too uh we'll do a longer tweethead next week once i've had some time to reflect and collect my thoughts um yeah this is a common story throughout the luna ecosystem obviously there are many many people who are bullish on the algo stable coins uh that that and sometimes when price goes up instead of taking money off the table people put more money on the table uh and you know i mean i do that too with ether uh this is this but that's my currency of choice other people picked terra as their currency of choice and just never really took money off the table and now have sadly lost a bunch of their net worth um one thing frontier this is risky yeah well one thing i will say about jose is he took the the bull case but he also went all in so he wasn't just saying this and i think that's um you know even though he got massively hit uh during this event it is it is commendable um he wasn't just talking he was putting his money where his mouth was um but this is the the tara luna subreddit right now and uh what are we seeing here there's like a bunch of stories of people losing losing their savings uh it's just a bad place to be uh during the the 2018 to 2019 bear market like pinning uh the suicide hotline number on our cryptocurrency and other subreddits was a frequent exp thing like that happened many many times like on days like today where the whole entire market was down 30 40 percent uh and like some icos were going down to like you know down 80 90 percent the suicide hotline number was a very common thing to see pinned um a lot of people and what's sad about this uh is that like tara the ust and the and the yield wrapped around anchor was actually put into products and made into like neo bank savings accounts so like people would they would just wrap anchor and then like solicit savings and it was branded as a savings account so a lot of individuals just said oh i can get like you know 15 20 on my on my dollars so i'll deposit into this app and then the app just put it into into anchor in the back end and now a lot of retail a lot of and uniquely a lot of western retail in contrast to bitconnect which was largely eastern a lot of western retail uh really was hit by this and the reason why i differentiate that is because it's kind of when rest western retail people really get their western regulators western regulators come and that's when things get serious we're starting to see that already as we mentioned in our episode uh on wednesday this is uh janet yellen um talking to congress i believe and she's talking about she's asking for legislation by the end of this year on stable coin stable queen legislation um the sec this is a report that the sec they've already been suing terraform labs and one former sec lawyer is saying that they have every reason to continue to sue terraform and tariff for usd yes certainly um uh yeah i mean the sec served doe quan uh at main net missouri main net last year uh actually unrelated it was that his mirror pro mirror uh platform yeah but you can you can only imagine that they want to go after dokwan now they're already there will never be coming back to the united states a lot of funds were hurt in the process too i know these are these are rumors who don't have stories yet but um like some large funds were very exposed to not only luna and ust itself but to the entire ecosystem remember tara is a smart contract platform there are all sorts of different applications and builders developing on it before it turned weimer republic and just inflated away and and totally disappeared uh i don't know if we can mention any names or what we want to say about this but uh what would you say about the funds that were impacted by this and the capital outflow yeah well there's a lot of very public funds who who are all very publicly in the terra ecosystem i mean mike novogratz ryan has a terra tattoo of a wolf with a moon oh i remember that yeah yeah so i think we can go and go ahead and assume that galaxy digital took a big hit here the delphi boys the delphi team who are a great bunch of guys um they were all very bullish on terra i don't think delphi digital was uh exposed to tara too much but it was mainly delphi labs that had all the the terror exposure hashed tribe republic um some other funds are are definitely hit by this uh definitely hurting i uh one thing i i tweeted out because you know some people were saying that even talking about the events of this week right in the way that we've been talking about it which is like hey let's let's reflect let's learn some lessons let's also show empathy for those impacted particularly retail who didn't know better uh you know a lot a lot of people are saying hey don't dance on graves don't uh don't gloat and i want to be clear that like maybe some people are gloating in crypto but uh no one i respect is gloating about what happened it's very unfortunate uh no one i said this no one i respect is cheering for ust to fail all we're saying is we showed you that this was a possibility and by we i mean a lot of people in crypto vitalik was one of them for instance and many in the community dismissed it like it was maximalist flood so here's the thing a mature community can handle good faith critiques no chain is perfect this is an opportunity to grow i do think this is an opportunity for all of us but when you start to interact with the community that can't handle uh good faith critiques uh then that's when your warning signal should start to go off you know that something is wrong with this community they're not taking risk they're not taking criticism uh they're not taking issues maybe seriously enough and i think part of that culture is why we got where we got it with 50 billion in market claps uh basically overnight and definitely do kwan is to blame here he has been extremely aggressive extremely mean extremely toxic on twitter and he really created this culture in the terra ecosystem that that was an okay thing to do so when we had our terra bowl vs bear episode we got absolutely swarmed in the youtube comments saying like we're a bunch of maxies who don't know anything blah blah blah and just like this was the culture that do kwan created around his ecosystem of just like flooding every other project that says anything bearish about tara uh and so like dude dokwan takes should have all of the blame here and he has been the silence out of dokwan has been absolutely deafening in the last week all right guys so there's there's a lot more here there's a lot more that we have unpacked go listen to that episode um i'm gonna maybe close this section with with this david what do you think the takeaways are uh what did we learn from uh from this episode yeah crypto is here to completely reinvent money and finance uh we are going to completely eat the traditional financial system uh and then we're also going to make a much much bigger financial system and to replace it with so we can't take shortcuts along the way this is a long-term game and one when you see ecosystems taking shortcuts delegated proof of stake algorithmic stable coins baked into consensus fueling growth with unsustainable yields inside of anchor protocol when you take shortcuts to achieve growth you re-threaten the whole viability of this whole entire crypto project and especially as we have gone into this multi-chain ecosystem the choices that other layer one block chains impact other layer ones there is ether on the terra ecosystem there is ether on the solana ecosystem the choices that those layer ones make will come to impact the distribution of ether and the and the mechanics of proof of stake on the ethereum ecosystem we cannot have shortcuts determine the future of this whole entire financial system because the whole world will eventually become a crypto enabled world and what that world looks like is going to be determined by the choices that we make in the early genesis of this whole entire industry absolutely i think the best mental model i think fiskanti said something like this but when you're taking shortcuts like the centralization shortcuts algo stablecoin type shortcuts that you know the yield type of shortcuts that tara was taking you're actually uh taking returns and taking growth and taking profit from the future and you're bringing it forward in an unsustainable way so that is not what we want to do in crypto and that's why you know bank list has always been about okay let's build this thing right no no shortcuts let's do it decentralized let's obviously be open to all sorts of approaches but let's make sure they're they're sustainable in their long term if you want to hear our full take on that once again click in the show notes go to the crypto meltdown episode the biggest collapse in crypto history where we call uh covered all of this uh david i wish i could say this was the only stable coin drama this week but there was some other stable coin drama not nearly as significant of course but tether losing its one dollar peg what's that about yeah the timing on this is definitely just out of fear i would say um so ust loses its peg usdt tether also starts to lose its peg but the differences between these two things could not be more stark tether has money in the bank their redeemability window is always open where ust tara has to generate confidence from reflexivity which is a terrible thing to put confidence in uh tether usd generates confidence from actually being redeemable for actual dollars which it always is um but nonetheless during the fears of bitcoin dropping ether dropping almost half over half a billion dollar or half a trillion dollars of capital being wiped out people started to have fear about tether and other stable coins and so his tether started to lose its peg the pegasus i'm pretty sure since been restored uh but this just generally like added to the whole fear of the whole entire week this last week uh here's paulo arduino uh ceo of tether bitfinex or cto of bitfinex somewhere in that ecosystem he goes gm reminder that tether is honoring its usc redemptions at one dollar via tether.t.o 300 million dollars have been redeemed in the last 24 hours without a sweat drop so this is just a fear fear but getting fear uh but there's no unless i'm missing something and i'm pretty sure i'm not there's absolutely no reason to be fearful of tether and there almost has never been any fear to really be had about tether only fear mongering on the tether ecosystem not saying it's a great stable coin but it's always been redeemable yes it has i i think the thing that most the crypto industry would would want out of tether is uh additional transparency the kind of transparency we see at usdc and of course it's not decentralized either so ideally we want something much more decentralized but it doesn't pretend to be at the same time uh definitely not going to suffer the same fate as uh luna almost impossible for it to do so uh but that is not where the fear ended ryan people uh there was a report coming out of coinbase a report with the sec i believe uh that drew concerns about what would happen to user deposits uh if in the event that coinbase might go bankrupt and this became relevant because again the coin price is down bigly earnings is down uh and so people are and then also on top of that this report came out that said that when you deposit your crypto into coinbase you are not depositing it you are crediting crediting coinbase you are a creditor to coinbase and in the event of coinbase bankruptcy you would not be guaranteed to get your funds back you would be in line during bankruptcy court saying hey here's what coinbase owes me because i deposited one bitcoin whatever ether and so i would like to get that back but you would have to go to court to get that back according to this documentation so this also caused fear that people might not be able to get their money back in the event of coinbase going bankruptcy first and foremost there is no reason why coinbase is going bankrupt that is just like in the event of coinbase going bankrupt not that this is happening coinbase is not anywhere close to bankruptcy they have plenty of funding they have plenty of money so that is not a concern at all this is in the event that coinbase does indeed go bankrupt would i get my money back uh and so to address these concerns brian armstrong put out a tweet thread uh that read and gave out some of these answers and he goes well there while we have no risk of bank bankruptcy however we have included a new risk factor based on an sec requirement called sab 121 which is a newly required disclosure for public companies that hold crypto assets for third parties for our retail customers we are taking further steps to update our user terms such that we offer the same protections to these customers in a black swan event should we have the we should have had these in place previously so let me apologize for that the disclosure makes sense that in these legal protections have not been tested in court for crypto assets specifically and it is possible however unlikely that a court would decide to consider customer assets as part of the company in bankruptcy proceedings and so this is just because a crypto centralized exchange that takes user deposits has never gone bankrupt before and since crypto aren't they are not securities users and because of that there's just legal gray area so this is a regulatory concern as in we are this is unprecedented we've never seen this before therefore we've never had legislation before so this is actually not a call to action for coinbase this is a call to action for more legal clarity as there almost always is yeah i think that's the takeaway i think the the question of is coinbase going uh bankrupt or is coinbase going to take all of its user funds in the event of bankruptcy it's kind of much ado about nothing really this was as you said it wasn't a report by the sec this was an sec filing that coinbase had to make they registered it with the sec and uh it's just kind of some legal language near the bottom that i think people took they hadn't seen it before and they ran with it and they extrapolated it in in weird ways i can't imagine any court system would not decide to refund customers in the event of bankruptcy and coinbase is so far from bankruptcy it's not even a thing to worry about so much ado about nothing uh sometimes but yes but we still want more investor protections and investor confidence and that is up to the regulatory agencies yes much more legal clarity in cryptos as needed that's for sure um how about this david we were banned last sunday so i'm glad we really forgot bankless was banned from youtube okay this happened on sunday it was mother's day in fact i think i was in bed i woke up to text that morning on sunday morning david and i think it was a text from uh luke is our editor a text from you and he turned into discord and i saw this screenshot it's from ben on our team who's taking a screenshot of someone on twitter who said wtf just happened to bankless headquarters because our youtube was banned blocked we got letters we got email from youtube saying you've been deactivated uh we did get an email all right there's an email to my yeah my personal email account and it says it said something if it's not like it's helpful it just says like you broke our terms of service see you later you know i i'm like look what did we do oh no what did david do now did he upload something inappropriate but no it's just our regular bankless stuff so what happened here uh well that was the full story that's as much as we knew uh and so like this happened this happened uh saturday night and so uh this was that happened at like 10 or 11 p.m saturday night and so we kind of had an all hands moment in the bankless hq discord and we're like all right what do we do what do we do what do we do and we basically stayed silent because it was the middle of the night we know like the way forward for this is to make a bunch of noise but we're going to wait until sunday morning to do that and so uh we some we emailed uh some people that we've had on the show we know have connections to youtube but basically we knew that it was going to come down to making a ton of noise on twitter uh and so sunday morning drafted up a tweet said like yo bank list was bankless is banned retweet this to make sure that you want to let youtube know that we want to get bankless youtube back and instantiated uh in in live again and that that worked uh definitely the most liked tweet out of bankless ever hit 14 000 likes inside of like uh i don't know a couple days and so thank you for everyone that helped do this couldn't have done it without you couldn't have done it without our community um especially all the people watching on the youtube right now this is back online because we were able to make a bunch of noise what's crazy about this story is like once again no reason was given we were just completely deactivated so we had we had uh you know 150 000 subs uh subscribers on bankless youtube and then 10 000 hours of content like all of our podcasts all of our videos all completely wiped now we use youtube for distribution of course so we do have backups of this sort of thing but to be just completely wiped from a platform on the internet does not feel good and lots of people say well why don't why don't you host it uh you know in ipfs and with web3 technologies and platforms and the truth is a lot of these platforms aren't ready yet for what we're trying to do and the other thing is part of the bankless mission is we want to reach as many people as possible a billion people uh plus we can't do that unless we have the distribution of web 2 and so we need web 2 in the interim but if they're going to ban us we will go to take our content to other platforms certainly it's one thing i love about our uh our podcast david is we control the rss feed in the podcast world right you just publish and then apple picks it up or spotify picks it up now spotify is trying to be like a a platform a social media thing so they're a little bit different it's very different in the video world there's no like rss feed for videos so you have to host it on a platform so a lot of challenges with that i mean the the short story is because we got our community because you helped us raise make a lot of noise about this there were tweets people were pinging youtube people were talking about uh cancelling their uh subscription all of these things that's why we were restored it was because of you thank you we appreciate it well done thanks for the listener class for the listener uh bankless nation came through for us now it's great because we have a community that can support us and we've gotten to a size where we can get loud and we can mobilize when we need to but there were other content producers uh crypto content producers gabriel uh is one uh who are also banned in this in this crypto banning incident it's not the first time this has happened to the crypto industry either and some people don't have the ability to raise a ruckus get on youtube's radar and get decisions like this reversed so uh it's a real problem it really is and it's it's so all of this small and this happens rampantly throughout the ecosystem we're just those small indie producers who just like making videos for their small community can't figure out how to get the attention of youtube and so those people just do not have a voice because they are silenced by the web 2 world eventually we got a reply this from team youtube saying confirming bankless channels back up we're so sorry this happened looking into other channels and channels you mentioned in your tweet thank you so much for bearing with us dming you with more uh they still haven't reinstated others i will say that one of the bank list's best assets is that we have is that we talk about the value of censorship resistance and de-platforming we talk about the perils of web too so this is the wrong community to mess with because we talk about this all the time and so like when youtube and other web 2 platforms come to d platform crypto relevant communities like we know what we're doing what we're dealing with we know what we're talking about so it's just like the wrong thing to mess with yeah absolutely this is a invading russia in the winter type of move here uh i i will say like we don't know fully why we were banned and a reason was never given this could have been bots going crazy this could have been a complete mistake but that's just the point isn't it right it's like you get banned you have no idea why no one tells you anything and there's no recourse for you uh so voice was our only recourse and that's what we used to their credit youtube did reinstate us quite quickly and also and i thought very highly of this the ceo of youtube okay she apologized publicly on twitter this is this is susan from the ceo of youtube we clearly made a mistake bankless glad our teams were able to fix things quickly and then she goes on can you dm me your contact info and we can talk offline love the level of conversation happening around crypto on youtube very interested in web3 and the role we can play in the topic so i think the bankless community just helped us perform a jujitsu move which is we turned crypto youtube like channel gets banned into a conversation with the ceo of youtube so now we're about to go have a conversation with the ceo of youtube she's scheduled something for david and i have no idea what she wants to talk about but i think it's about this david very interested in web 3 and the role youtube can play in the topic okay again earlier like you know earlier this week instagram adding nfts okay web 2 realizes that they are going to need web 3 in the future and so i think we can turn this into something good not saying we have full um you know like unmitigated trust in in youtube and we want to depend on them for everything in the future but they can help propagate web3 protocols and web3 technology and so we want to use them whenever whenever we can to propagate that freedom so uh turn this into a good thing and it was thanks to the bankless community thank you thank you once again once again well done we needed you guys all right let's go in and get into some layer two things because while many many things are down some things are up here's kelvin fitcher on twitter saying optimism hitting a transaction day record today interesting stuff seems to be holding up so i put some data together here in this image here two things that are at all time highs on optimism is daily transaction fees hitting records for three days in a row i think dwarfing doubling the daily average transaction fees of history and also fees earned per day also at just gargantuan all-time highs on the optimism layer two uh if you don't know about retroactive public goods funding and how the fees on optimism layer two can go into your pocket you gotta listen to that uh layer two trillion dollar bowl case for layer two opportunity episodes that we put on the bankless youtube and podcast recently but optimism seeing just some great growth and you just love to see it also a fantastic article very short article three minute read was released called the economics of roll-up feeds from alex beckett there's this line that roll ups get cheaper with more users and it goes into the full deep dive about how this is true there are various costs for layer twos fixed cost variable cost average variable cost total cost marginal cost average cost and when you put all this data together you get a full comprehensive other understanding as to how layer two fees work but basically layer two fees go down the more people use them this is a great resource to understand some some more technical content in an easy to understand format there's a link in the show notes to read all of that but tldr is rollups get cheaper when more people use them that's crazy because layer ones do the complete opposite they get more expensive as more people use them so there are no economies of scale uh and this is great news for uh for roll-ups and just some quick and final stats on the layer two ecosystem right now optimism did five hundred thousand dollars of fee revenue just yesterday arbitrary two hundred thousand and layer two is ryan can consume two point two percent of all daily gas used on ethereum yesterday the second highest on record so when i say when you guys are we're all sad that the prices are going down but the bull market opportunity is on layer two so you gotta grab the bull by the horns gotta grab the bull by the horns yeah this is uh we'll see how layer two is fair during the crypto recession but it's looking good so far and um yeah i'm expecting big growth here too crypto recession i like that more than crypto bull market yeah i think that's uh i think that's what we're in i think it's is a crypto recession right kind of a blip uh nft stuff though this doesn't feel like it should happen during a crypto recession because this is big news i think on any other week this would be what we would talk about the most and lead with instagram is now providing support for sharing nfts uh and they started doing this on monday mark zuckerberg talked about i actually didn't get caught up with all of his comments but the tldr is we want to work with web3 web3 is very important we're going to be kind of the centralized pieces but we recognize that decentralized protocols are also important and so we're going to incorporate nfts into our technology stack into our platform into what we're doing in virtual reality but also more immediately into freaking instagram okay 2.9 billion people on the planet use facebook use instagram use meta products and now we're providing them another gateway to crypto that is not recession stuff it's kind of bullish uh what platforms are they plugging in well uh one of them is going to be ethereum of course uh in the future solana and flow as well but co-launching with ethereum is actually polygon uh and this is pretty big so the rights a lot of the the reads will happen like if you're reading nft data from from the chain you just want to display something in instagram that's going to be ethan polygon solana and flow but the rights according to uh one of our sources will happen only at first on ethereum and polygon the rights that means minting they're going to mint on ethereum and polygon and this functionality will start to be exposed into instagram david i feel like we have to unpack that entire story like i feel like we need somebody from meta to actually come on bankless maybe maybe this is enemy territory i don't know how they view it but maybe we're collaborators uh as well i mean they need us more than we need them right okay so they just come into our house let's come on bank list mark zuckerberg let's talk about what you are doing uh with nfts and how you plan to incorporate that into meta but i feel like this is super bullish yeah we are actually recording with the polygon team tomorrow friday for an episode that will come out uh while we were at permissionless on tuesday so we're going to talk all about this and of course i'm sure william peacer out of the metaversal newsletter from bankless will also be going into the deep dive as well so if you're looking for more information on this stay tuned because bankless got you per usual per usual leading into this one ethereum nft collection doodles names billboard executive as new ceo so nft pfp communities getting ceo getting executive leadership uh i mean we saw it work with yugo labs and board apes so why not why not other others and doodles definitely have the capital to get it done uh so congratulations to julian holgwin holgrin for joining the nfc collective doodles that's cool uh the pope's getting into nfts david can you believe this man i did see this dude you didn't see that coming the vatican is preparing a gal that was not a joke i saw the news no i did not see it coming the vatican is preparing a gallery in the metaverse with nfts uh so nfts are for everyone man look everyone's getting into it i could read more but you can click a link in the show notes to see what the vatican and the pope is doing with nfts in an effort to democratize art in the vatican city in partnership with augmented reality company sensorium and humanity 2.0 will create a virtual exhibit exhibition based on nfts uh i did not have that one on my bingo card also breaking out of pool suite this one's really real quick and easy pool suite it's a nft company nft team that got this nft membership for joining pool parties uh they are launching manor dow because they want to buy a manner so if you want to be a part of manor dow you can join manordal at manordow.com uh the aesthetics of pool suite i always thought was really cool also ryan this news reporter this 80s themed news reporter her name's ali i went to college with her i haven't seen her yeah right through her from the 80s how old are you david where are you dude like she she's all about the 80s she just looks like she's from the 80s uh anyways it's crazy to see this person i was hanging out with in college uh on a pool sweet twitter account tweet uh what's up ali it's been a while that's amazing do you think she listens to bank list david i don't think so i think this is her first thing go look her up send this to her uh let's talk about regulation i mean we talked about a lot of it but do you remember when arthur hayes and company bit mex uh was brought to task for illegal trading oh i have certainly i certainly remember absolutely because it seems like so long ago to me i guess this is uh what what's happening now there's a court order i think this has been mostly resolved is ordering arthur hayes and the bit mex founders to pay 30 million dollars for illegal training actually 10 million each for the three of them for a total sum of 30 million dollars uh arthur hayes i'm pretty sure his personal net worth at maybe at the peak you think he can afford it it could have been a billion dollars dude uh so a 10 million dollar fine to arthur's haze slap on the wrist is nothing is nothing that is a fart for him uh and so yeah i think he's gonna be fine uh and also like i'm kind of curious as to what happens when arthur hayes gets out from under just all of this mess all this legal mess like what he's he's been writing about crypto he's been into crypto what does arthur hayes do next oh yeah he's not retired that's for sure so we will have to see um tridefy stuff do you know germany doesn't tax you on crypto if you sell it after one year did you know that i'm moving right now okay that's that's a thing like uh brooklyn i'm going to germany germany isn't going to tax bitcoin not going to attack tax ethereum if it's sold after one year of possession even if they're used for staking amazing this is like the most crypto friendly legislation i've seen i mean maybe maybe someone lives in a jurisdiction in a country somewhere that has more favorable legislation than this but of course in the us you've got short-term capital gains if it's less than a year and then term if it's over a year there's no condition where you're not paying taxes on crypto right yep tax rate is always coming yeah incredible not in germany germany the tax man is banned after one year i guess i guess they are trying to attract crypto natives to the german economy i'm not sure why i'm sure it's gonna work what's this david uh yeah coindesk uh there was a this is a coindesk article saying uh with a headline we effed up big time millions of dollars worth of juno tokens were supposed to be sent to a community wallet because a copy and paste error validators sent the funds to a wrong wallet permanently 36 million dollars of juno tokens just deleted this chain has been kind of a mess i believe um the the quote from the article's unprecedented community vote last week was supposed to seize millions of dollars worth of juno tokens from the wallet of a whale who was accused of gaming a community airdrop so basically it was a token holder vote to snatch the tokens out of this individual's accounts and then unfortunately the validators in the juno network were going to restore these tokens to the rightful owner just like fat fingered it copied and pasted it and sent it to the wrong address they screwed up again whoopsies uh yeah these are not not in your marketplace you know ecosystems all right moving on moving on last week the hop protocol announced hopped out and of course the hop token they say today hop begins this journey to become a core ethereum infrastructure operated and controlled by our community the hop drop it's out you might have got one if you've used the protocol if you sent more than one thousand dollars over a hot protocol you got the airdrop if you sent 100 over how protocol 10 times you also got the airdrop if you liquidity provided you've got the airdrop you can check your airdrop probably the link in the show notes uh but we also did a show with them i did a show with chris winfrey uh detailing all about the hop and how where it came from how it came to be not very very little capital investment into hot protocols so like very very community owned ethos is strong they actually got swarmed by a bunch of their quote unquote community members because the people got mitigated out of the hop drop because people farmed the hell out of hop trying to farm the air drop but they did a very good job mitigating airdrop farmers to making sure that their token went to their community members who were actually engaged and this made a lot of people very very angry because their farming strategies got nullified um but and so like there's this angry cohort of people who are in the hop discord yelling at the hop team saying this is unfair you're only giving it to wales but again if you if you sent 100 over hop 10 times you also got the air drop and so i wrote an article bank list last monday detailing the changing airdrop meta because optimism also had these changing airdrop strategies to mitigate farmers and to make sure that the token goes to their community and so this is the new airdrop meta and if you want to understand that read the article but basically if you want to get future airdrops you can't just try and farm them with minimum viable strategies you've got to pretend like you're a user so you might as well actually just become a user uh and so that's a real person be a real person you have to create like 40 different metamask accounts to try to farm the thing just like use it just use it as a normal person would use it and you're more likely to get tokens now that's that's a good thing i think that's definitely a good thing uh compound finance this is actually really cool uh today compound treasury received a b minus credit rating from s p global ratings this makes compound treasury the first institutional defy offering to be rated by a credit rating agency pretty cool uh pretty cool uh somebody joked that this actually makes them a b minus is junk bond but like that's not it's it's not compound protocol it's the assets and lending uh credit worthiness of the lenders it's all of the assets inside of it and the lenders that makes it a junk bond status but at least we're on there we're on the chart we got our work cut out for us man we just need better and better assets you can't expect to start at the top of this rating scale okay booties and s p and fitch we're gonna work our way up we call this junk now but now we're on the charts what's uh a lot of ios apps i've noticed recently this is a zapper's new ios mobile app that just came out it's here um go check this out go download it zapper is a fantastic tool for looking at your nft and crypto portfolio uh enough don't look at that part though wait until the bull market yeah yeah look at your nfts click the nft section okay just look at the pretty pictures and look at prices uh until we're out of this crypto recession uh dydx they just also announced the release of their ios app they were teasing some big news and i guess this is it it's really cool that these crypto defy exchanges are starting to get into the mobile space making their user interfaces that much more friendly and getting us ready for the other side of the crypto recession david when we come out of this and on board another 100 million or 200 million users uh also coming out of the news here is zora with a 50 million dollar raise so congratulations to zora coming out of katie han coinbase kindred ventures zora is an nft marketplace but it's also an nfc marketplace protocol so kind of like how matcha is a dex aggregator built on top of xerox zora is an nft marketplace built on top of the zora like aggregator right so it's a protocol and an app and so they've raised 50 million dollars they have been very explicit that a token is coming and so if you haven't made a purchase of an nft on zora i might you might do that for the token just do it like a normal human would okay yeah so don't be don't be ridiculous just buy something you like you might get a token but they have been very explicit that the token is definitely coming uh and so cool cool congratulations to zora one other raise that was notable this week uh is decrypt g-crypt is a crypto news crypto media publication they just spun out of consensus they were incubated by consensus and they raised 10 million dollars at a 50 million dollar valuation congrats to decrypt uh for that sometimes we include decrypt in our in our stories we're going through the rollup you know sometimes um good job decrypt jobs david now is our weekly reminder for you this is for you we don't do this for us this is for you a reminder to get a job in crypto because even if it's a bear market crypto still hiring david you got a job in crypto during the bear market didn't you oh yeah i got well i got it going into the bear market right i got my job in uh february of 2018 literally like six weeks after the top and then that company blew up uh later that in that august i got another crypto job that job blew up and then i got a third crypto job that company's still around uh and then i and then and then we started bankless but the difference between 2017 and 2018 not to scare you not to scare you guys but the difference is all of these companies have raised insane valuations over the last year they are flushed with cash ready to spend it uh so i do not think and plus okay the first company was an ico advisory company yeah david worked at some shady companies okay not real okay they were legitimate after after that one was an sto security token advisory which was like after once icos were done it rotated into seos and then both of those blew up yeah it seemed like a good idea at the time all of these things right that's something that we're leaving into the history because that didn't come forward well you know what it's the future and the present is these companies are hiring i'm gonna go through a few jobs on the bankless job boards where do you find this at bankless.pallet.com job make sure you sign up also join our collective submit your resume and these

maker vault and use your collateral to mint dye directly with maker the power to mint new money is in your hands the maker protocol is extremely hardened and operated by one of the most experienced dows in existence they've been here since the beginning they've seen it all and so you can mint die with the assurance that your collateral is safe soon maker will be present on all chains and l2s so minting dye can take place on oasis.app xerion zapper or any other d5 protocol that you use follow maker on twitter at maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient down existence we're back questions from the nation again a new segment out of the friday weekly roll up this is the second time we have done this but we're doing this every week going forward every wednesday there is a tweet coming out of bank lists saying questions from the nation if you have a question drop them in here we'll choose the ones that have a bunch of favorites to answer um this one only has one like but i personally like that i'm pretty sure that's my favorite one like it's me and so empty bags dot e says i can't stop buying eth my wife wants a new kitchen my kid needs braces it's hurting the ones i love i bought a sandwich the other day and cried halfway through when i calculated its opportunity cost in the future value of eat my question is should i also be buying matic and ryan you're an advisor to maddox so you can't answer this question that's not allowed so i'll go ahead and answer this question uh i have personally trimmed almost every single token uh and sold it into eth in the last like three months or so except for matic uh and so that is one of the very few tokens that i still hold um because i mean player two season is ahead and also have you seen how much execution matic has the polygon ecosystem has done they they just onboarded nfts with instagram uh and so like i'm into the layer two thesis i'm into the layer two rotation uh and matic has been around for a very long time they are building very very aggressively uh i of course will never advise you to buy anything other than ether um but matic uh doesn't seem like a bad buy yeah i i would i would bucket this in the theme of layer twos as well we are very bullish on layer two ecosystems in general matic is partially a layer two it's partially not but it has a foot in both worlds has a lot of layer two type acquisitions well that's just the thematic polygon or the polygon proof of stake chain there's also like the infinity other zk roll ups and other chains also related to matic yeah that's what i'm talking about all right let's go to the next question uh so the next question from jasper the frog the jasper thefriendlyghost.edu are you sure these aren't your alt accounts david this is these names are real here i mean that last question kind of seemed like a little little fishy there do i look like i've got a kid with braces ryan you'd look like you'd write that in a question to us real world assets are supposed to scale die into a real usdc competitor are you worried about the introduction of assets that have pricing based on centralized agencies if dye becomes say 20 usdc 40 u.s property 40 crypto we've actually increased u.s reliance the the meat of this question is what about all of the nation state dependencies that are backing the value of dye what do you say to that david yeah so so many people just misunderstand dye and how it's built and what this ethos is so i'll i'll take that usdc isn't the most ideal collateral inside of maker but also the maker team would also agree with that however you at 40 u.s property people think that that is like a centralized centralization regulatory risk but it's actually not because every single instance of real-world assets inside of maker dow is its own specific agreement its own specific legal structure and that legal structure isn't on chain it there are individual trusts that are that are just behold beholden to the maker protocol itself so there is not one single like sweeping legislation that could stop all of these assets being good collateral inside of maker dow and so if there is like 50 different uh real world assets 100 different real world assets or if like the maker dial vision comes like thousands and thousands of instances of real world assets inside of maker dao every single one of those is its own independent thing there is no centralization amongst all of those things and so the real world assets itself are decentralized because there's so many of them it's decentralization by numbers and it also gets just just a regulatory immunity because it's playing nice with the united states it's putting it's making the capital and value of the united states to work so it's actually playing inside of an ecosystem that is friendly in a very safe and secure way and so it's both being is both like playing nice with regulators but also being untouchable by regulators at the same time it's so genius it's so genius and people think it's oh this is centralization like it's actually not it's roundabout decentralization and it's beautiful i think i think the so the the one thing that dye does depend on is uh it's basically the game theory that no not all nation states will in all jurisdictions will ban like defy and die and make her at the same time it's kind of playing that game theory arbitrage there's always going to be some friendly jurisdiction out there if there was a super if there was a world where the government went ultra evil all governments they cluded together all jurisdiction said we're going to wipe this thing off the map first of all it's very unlikely because as you said they have a lot to lose if they do that then maybe you could say hey we need something different we need something more than die but in which case we have ether we have bitcoin we have other um stable-ish assets like rye which are super interesting which is basically the die play only it's completely eth collateral and it's all settled on chains so i feel like crypto has a lot of options for this but let's get to the next question david because we got it before before before that uh just one last thing um the strength of the real world assets inside of maker dow is related to the strength of property rights of that particular country so you will never see like chinese real assets inside of maker dow just because you know china will come and take your stuff but like the the assurances that property rights are good in particular countries will lead into real world assets inside of maker dao yes um let's go to this question why is everyone saying that eat staking yield will rise after the merge from the current four and a half percent or so that's what you get if you stake eve to more than ten percent i couldn't find any explanation to that david what is the simple explanation as to why we're get close to 10 post merge on each staking yield right so if you are staking people right now with proof of work people pay and they bribe miners to get their transaction ahead of the line right if you need your transaction in immediately you got to pay miners extra above and beyond the base fee above and beyond the typical gas fee to get your transaction in the line this accounts for roughly about 10 percent of the total transaction fee and this is where these uh the staking yields will increase from the current 4.5 percent to the now hypothesized seven percent the hypothesized number used to be way higher like 12 to 15 percent but that was during defy summer when gas fees were like 400 to 1000. now that gas fees have settled down to 10 percent the equilibrium has been about 90 percent base fee 10 staking tips but in the post-merge validators get the tips rather than the miners and so the staking yield for east taking will go up to include the value of the tips yeah you're going to get those sweet sweet transaction fees is the tldr and the the percentage is also affected by the amount of people who stake so if there's more people staking if there's more capitals being staked then percentage actually goes down so ideally in our conversation with hal press earlier this week he's like in my perfect world i'd be the only staker of eth right because that would maximize hal press's returns of course also my perfect world for al press for free no for me i want to be the only saker of youth all right let's get to the takes guys this is the first one from kevin owaki it's all about daos yeah kevin owaki says the community has hurt itself by restrictively defining the a doubt to mean a community group embracing the tyranny of this structurelessness uh this is basically the tyranny of the structurelessness basically means like when there is no structure there are the people who uh people can create tyranny in that structure because there's no rules and so kevin follows up and says there's been a rather successful movement to discredit the efforts of any dow with even a loosely centralized structure as not being a really a real dow kevin follows and says in my opinion this is totally wrong the d endow can just mean decentralized governance via a permissionless token it doesn't have to mean a chaotic loose web of individuals the a in dell can just mean some level of smart contract automation to help with high level decision making it doesn't uh it doesn't have to mean that all in initiatives must be atomic well-formed compound style direct democracy proposals the oh endow can just mean what it means in trad fire a group of people and and resources with a mission and structure that to achieve that mission i've been been hammering this home for a while daos are the worst name they decentralize autonomous organizations we should actually just call those defy apps things like uniswap things like compound those are daos the dowels that people think of like bankless dao or git coin dao are actually dues decentralized organizations or digital organizations they're just basic we need all the same hierarchies we need all the same structure we need all the same delegation of responsibilities but also in the digital realm and so instead of filing like an llc with delaware you make a transaction on ethereum to incorporate a token for your digital organization not a dow and so if you are a dao it's like oh we don't want leadership because we want to be decentralized you're wrong you do want leadership because leaders get stuff done uh so when instead of thinking dao's think dudes digital organizations i think in the ideal do uh the the truth is everyone can be a leader too or anyone can be a leader which means it's very meta metocratic you can just you know chip in do something rise to the top if you're providing value to that organization so it's not as doesn't need to be as hierarchy hierarchy it doesn't need it to be a hierarchy as corporations are as well there's much more uh much more ability to just get things done this is a tweet from some guy ryan sean adams tweets out sometimes the best investments in crypto are the ones you don't make what does that mean what i mean is like you know it's kind of like warren buffett where he'll um he'll just sit there for years sometimes years goes by and doesn't deploy any capital doesn't do anything he's just patient right and i think sometimes in crypto we feel like we always have to be deploying capital doing something buying trading and that's when we get ourselves in the most trouble right sometimes the best thing you can do is absolutely nothing sometimes the best investment you make is the one you actually don't make right you just don't give in to the fomo don't give in to the the fud and you just maybe don't eat into that thing i think a lot of people learn that with tara this week it's just i you know i was getting a nice 20 yield on my my ust but i didn't realize the risks associated with that yield did not compensate for the yield that i was getting so the risk-adjusted reward was not 20 it was something very far in the negative direction right and so sometimes we'll do our best work in our best investing when we're not overly eager when we spend time to actually understand what we're investing in we feel very certain that what we're buying has strong fundamentals uh i think we've gotten in some bad habits over the past like 18 months or so in the past bull market of like aping in remember you know that term that just really rose to prominence in phase let's just ape in it's kind of fun yeah you want to ape into some things but like let's not go overboard with it uh and uh i think people are realizing that truth this week as we're coming out of the lunar crisis all right wow uh the week is over but uh what are you excited about oh hang on we still got friday left whatever happened on friday sorry we didn't cover it i'm sure something's gonna happen but ryan i'm excited for the cheap ether man like uh when we were uh uh doing the show with hal press i like opened up my gemini gemini account in like 2x the size of my daily buys and like as the price has gone down like i'm seeing those daily buys like get me more ether and so that gets me excited he did that like mid podcast what did you talk to oh yeah sometimes you say wait on your investments and i'm like well not for ethan yeah he just destroyed my last take and you were like look but this is this is the yin yang look i'm all gat you're all gas i'm i'm breaks and that's why you listen to bank lists because you get the taste of both yeah both it's also daily average buy so i'm not baking vaping my entire bank account david's not crazy [Laughter] anyways the bear market is like i spent 2018 through 2020 like learning everything i knew about crypto uh and so the bear market kind of feels like home man like the the moon boys are gone the noise is gone we've returned to fundamentals we can start to think not in one year long time frames but decade long time frames and that's just really refreshing really healthy and like you know some this is the part of the cycle where some people uh will stick around and learn the value of decentralization centric resistance permissionlessness all the things that make crypto tick and the people that don't will leave and they'll form fomo back into the next bear market like 50 too late and so the spoils go to people who stick around and learn these lessons uh last week ryan i said i was excited for permission listen to to meet you i'm so excited about that but i said that last week uh and so this week ryan i'm excited for the bear market yeah look i'm looking forward to that too but you know i'm also excited about the bear market i'm just gonna i'm gonna plus one that because i guess maybe we'll call it the crypto recession instead does that make people feel better right you feel better now and it's like it's like uh bear market building recession building is the best kind you said lower prices we also get back to fundamentals i feel like for for a long time people weren't um weren't paying attention to the things that that really mattered in crypto and so we get a lot less noise a lot more ability to kind of like focus on what matters a lot more writing gets done uh as we've said before the the tourist leave and the settlers stay so it's kind of a it's kind of a great time to be in crypto and the cool thing is i've never been more certain in any other crypto recession bear market thing that uh crypto was going to make it out on the other side and be even stronger for it it's like in 2017 2018 in that bear market 2018 2019 like i wasn't so sure i mean like when i didn't even question my sanity in 2020 right it's the only thing that we've produced here bitcoin is d5 really going to take off will anyone care like keep in mind none of these things existed nfts weren't a thing smart contracts only had one use case and that was the ico and it was just absolutely obliterated some people said tokens will never come back as a result of this uh so we've come so far and now there's not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that crypto is gonna be here for the long run so that's why you and i are just smiling throughout this episode because even though we're in a crypto recession even though we got people have bear market blues and a lot's gone on a lot of people have lost money crypto as an asset class isn't going anywhere and that's why this is still the opportunity of a generation now more than the last time you listen to a bankless episode right it's like there's even more opportunity now because prices are lower certainly certainly yeah we invented defy last bear market what will we invent this bear market i don't know but it will be great it'll be very big all right meme of the week what what we had david oh god i'm just gonna let this play uh this is the tweet is what you look like when you show your nfts to other people uh and this is like for the listeners out there this is like the tick tock video where people are lining up they're doing a move and they walk off camera i don't know what game this is but they all have something like like thing around their way like a fanny pack that's like like laser tag power ranger it's something i don't actually understand i don't know but these are like grown men dude [Laughter] is this really what we like have you ever shown someone one of your nfds in public oh 100 totally really dude i have a nft on my wall man so do i have you haven't even noticed it you haven't even seen it oh yeah your turtle's back huh yeah it's a recession market turtle okay david it's just slowing things down for the recession all right no need to be speedy were you you you were rating the hardest podcast for that one oh i had that you know what also guys stick around because we've got a really hot moment of zen from ben from the optimism team who knew ben was so talented of course guys if you
