principle which he is now going to yeah so he has been summoned bankless Nation it is the last Friday of March it's time for what is it David uh the bank was Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor this week is a medium week not so bad so everyone can take it breather medium still still a lot to happen though uh so yeah we persevere nonetheless regardless of whether it was a big week or a medium week uh in crypto and here we are you have to you have to keep going right because you never know which roll-up might be the last roll-up you just never know life is uncertain David uh a few topics of the week though oh I I gotta start here you're not in your usual place though no different background different background yeah I'm currently in Montenegro which is not ever every spot that I ever thought I'd be to be honest wait a second wait a second isn't that the place dokwan was just found or like late last week Friday of last week and you are there too I was at the same airport that Juan dokwan was at like five days uh ahead of me yeah I'm I'm on the hunt for dokwon that's what I'm doing people don't know right now whether you're joking or what's going on but we'll just let the mystery continue we got some topics of the week number one there is a cftc versus binance Battle Finance getting busted by the cftc we're gonna dig into that what else David uh zkevm continues we got two of them this week last week we had one this week we have they're done every week yeah every week so far they have been doubling every single week for two weeks in a row uh and then lastly uh Gary Denzel until the principal's office can we get Gary Gensler to the principal's office wait I thought he was the principal you can bring him to another office there's there's the principal's principle which he is now going to yeah so he has been summoned uh to uh testify are these the right words uh in court about his actions against the crypto community in court is it in court excuse me no not in court not in court in front according to the people which is congress Gary Gensler to face Congress grilling over crypto policy Gary Gensler will testify before the house Financial Services committee okay so Gary Gensler is testifying in front of the house about his treatment of us there we go those are the details I'm I'm here for a good genzler grilling I'm I'm here for it let's do it that's exactly what I want speaking of product Market fit we got to talk about our friends over at in Fiora because they have a an API nft API that I think has some product Market fit David tell us about it this one's for the devs isn't it yeah this is for the devs so this is for an 8 Pi for your nft dap if you will so whether you if you don't know what that means you're not a Dev yeah so just absorb this knowledge through osmosis I'll brute force it into your brain uh so inferior has got an SDK for you the nft Builder out there whether you are doing most of the things that nft contracts do selling in nft buying an nft minting an nft infuro has got an SDK for you to make that easy for you three smart contract templates to allow you to write onto eight different blockchains and mint nfts either ERC 721s or 115 tokens to really expedite the building of your nft process your nft application there is a link in the show notes for you to get started you can sign up an account with inferior to get started or you could just go to banklist.cc slash inferior there it is uh well will it help me shill in nft that's another verb that's uh hey we all start somewhere but uh that's not in specifically the API okay can't help you shell can help you do everything else though click the link in the show notes guys gotta get to the markets David what is bitcoin telling us on the week uh Bitcoin down half a percent which I consider flat uh so start of the week at 28 000 dish currently or 28 700 currently at 28 420. week for Bitcoin in the week I'll take a flat uh how about eth down 2.3 on the week start of the week at eight hundred eighteen hundred twenty five dollars currently at 1795 2.5 I mean all this not bad considering right not considering yeah interesting I think we'll get into that in a little bit how about the ratio what's that saying on the week also flat uh down two percent um so 0.063 so I believe the third consecutive week of a Down ratio price um yeah uh how about total crypto market cap 100.23 trillion dollars one two three not too bad I look I consider all of this a win in this economic environment yeah a bear market right yeah just like hopefully this is not only narrative hopefully there was actually real new buyers of Bitcoin in the last since the last banking crisis the worst case scenario would be that it was just sidelined crypto traders who had a bunch of stable coins who then decided to buy on the narrative that real buyers would be coming that's what we don't want to be true what we do want to be true is Bankers we're like Bitcoin okay I think that's probably still early I think it's all still the same recycled buyers but that's how all of the experience starts I know that's still the bear case but it doesn't mean that they're wrong right now and you have to start somewhere and you always start with that Foundation of existing buyers who are like I'm a little scared I'm going to stable coins and then they buy back in I think this might be the story as to why David and this to me looks like fundamentals this is from Jim Bianco this is the fed's updated balance sheet you can see the numbers here now two-thirds of the quantitative tightening has been reversed so over the course of starting in 2021 all the way to up till March the FED had been actually sorry from 2022 March of 2022 or so up till 2023 a full year the FED had been tightening they had been um destroying assets uh on the balance sheet decreasing the balance sheet I I shouldn't say and it went from like nine trillion dollars all the way to 8.35 trillions they got 7 100 billion dollars in decrease in the FED balance sheet and then what happened David uh then 500 billion dollars came back inside of two weeks so nice try fed you guys you guys really did your best uh and Ryan you're saying you said we uh the Fed was able in the last year again the interest rate started March 2022 uh now we are in March 2023 one year so we had good a good old good old try a good old good old-fashioned fed tribe let's try third old College try we started at basically nine trillion dollars so when you said we shaved off 700 uh billion dollars we we started from nine trillion dollars so 700 billion dollars is a lot of money it's quite a lot of money uh we started from nine trillion dollars we got down to basically 8.3 trillion dollars and then in the last it took us a year to go from 9 trillion to 8.3 trillion and now it took us two weeks to go from 8.3 trillion into 8.7 trillion 75 trillion David this seems to be the big deal you had a good run fed well but like there's still some debate here so a lot of people are still saying including uh Ben Hunt who we had on the podcast as part of kind of are the banks insolvent is the dollar going to hyperinflate says this Spike right here is just temporary you know he always uses the analogy of like you inject liquidity right into the heart right this is kind of the like right you wake up the patient kind of needle uh and then it it goes back down eventually whereas biology Arthur Hayes say this is permanent and by the way this Spike you ain't seen nothing yet this is going to continue to increase biology is like in 90 days this is going to be massive whereas Arthur Hayes thinks it will take years Jim Bianco gave us a pretty reason take I feel like was was kind of in the middle wait and see how would you summarize Jim bianco's take from our episode earlier this week Jim Bianco is towards the Ben Hunt end of the spectrum so I was say biology and Arthur Hayes are actually pretty close to each other in terms of their position like biology saying 90 days until bitcoin's one million dollars which is very fast Arthur Hayes saying two years to a million dollars which is still very fast two years maybe a million yeah Millions on the table in two years yeah Ben Hunt is like that's complete noise and Ridiculousness and actually totally irresponsible and Jim Bianco is less emotional I'd say than bent Hunt is but still directionally agrees with Ben Hunt saying that yes this line that we are looking at on the screen is extremely vertical we just erased two years of rising interest rates think of all the the pain in the market that we've had for the last year excuse me the year of interest rates think about the pain that we've had and then we just erase all that progress from the fed's perspective inside of two weeks Jim Bianco says okay but this Spike that we've had is not systemic um it doesn't mean the same amount of QE and liquidity injection that is Jimmy checks do and so this is much more contained compartmentalized to just the banking sector and it's not going to leak out to the actual bank accounts of you know Mom and Pop and Joe and Alice right and so uh I think I think this is actually if and of those four interviews that we did and damn did we really try and get down to the bottom of this and I feel like we did with Jim Bianco yeah I feel uh I feel closer on this honestly I I went in being like let's get two sides of the story here and what we ultimately ended up getting is like four different perspectives which is which is actually closer to reality I mean things are complicated real life is complicated and so getting all of those four perspectives uh kind of uh yeah I feel closure on it anyway this is another piece um of the macro story here this is elf saying the same thing macro elf that is it took 215 years for the US to reach 7 trillion in debt this is he's zooming out here then it took only 27 months March 2020 to June 2022 to add another 7 trillion 215 years to get to the first seven trillion David and then 27 months to get to the next 7 trillion this is of course all of the outstanding debt um you know from covid this is the big jump right here these 27 months this is the big story I think here of like if you zoom out a little bit even past the two-year mark look how large and how fast the FED balance sheet has actually grown yeah he also finishes that tweet saying uh debt is not a bug of our credit based money system it's actually a feature what does he mean by that I'm confused by that I think he's saying central banks are kind of designed to do this this is what they do I mean this is the nature of like compound interest right so like when you see an exponential curve like that I don't think it should be totally like foreign that this is happening because I mean this when you inflate a currency at two percent per year this is actually the the shape the same shape of the chart that it would look like uh this is certainly more than two percent per year but this is what happens did you listen to so Ben Hunt's strongest point to me is like you can have a hard money Bitcoin type of or ethereum type of um monetary system because what you lose is credit you you lose this the ability to pull social credit together and that's what a Fiat regime brings and and by the way he he would argue the last you know 100 150 years of economic Prosperity everything we enjoy in a modern economy is because we have that social credit we have that trust and so he really rejects the the idea that we would kind of go back in time and re-establish things uh that so that's his take and I think maybe macro Alpha is saying something similar in debt is not a bug of our credit based money system it's it's a feature right how else do you get credit David in kind of a hard money hard asset regime that that's the the question Ben Hunt posed and I understand elements of that and Jim Jim Bianco kind of echoed that and he's like hey Banks actually play this is bankless but Banks play a function did you know the function that they play is not as a data it's not as a money Warehouse that's kind of stupid I mean we can hold our own private Keys we don't have to Warehouse our money inside of a um you know Wells Fargo but the role that they do play is like small community credit creation and that is a role that right now defying cryptos is not fulfilling and there is some role for banks in that world so I understand that perspective too yeah I think the thought experiment to really um understand this this metaphor that Ben Hunt was saying was that um say say we have a Bitcoin standard you could have a bank that have big coin that has Bitcoin deposits that operate on a fractional Reserve System so they take in 10 Bitcoins and then they lend out 100 Bitcoins and then they charge interest rates to get that back the the reason why so in theory like you can still get credit in a Bitcoin system uh if you had just like a Bitcoin bank that denominated in Bitcoin and did the whole fractional Reserve thing that's technically still possible the reason why the economics would still be different is that in the Bitcoin banking system with a Bitcoin standard with Bitcoin credit you actually don't have a Federal Reserve which can mint Bitcoins on the other side to backstop Banks if something goes wrong and so even in a Bitcoin banking system you still have uh much more credit risk because again if the bank goes insolvent you have somebody who can print Bitcoins on the other side which allows for more credit at lower interest rates therefore more investment in the future therefore ultimately more debt on the federal reserve's balance sheet to happen yeah this is my question look at this chart David So this Central Bank chart how does this chart compete against this chart something like this crypto economic system by the way for those directions not seen in podcast like uh just listening to this so the FED balance sheet is obviously you know spiking up expanding at a precipitous rate and I just pulled up ultrasound money which is ethereum uh Supply decreasing um right those charts are inverted to each other so which do you want to hold do you want to hold treasuries in the dollar or do you want to hold this thing that's what I don't think central Bankers have fully calculated that now there is another option right a better option and we get to we do get to have both like we want to as individuals hold ether because of its deflationary properties and it's a store of value over the long term and as a society we also want Fiat so we can get a home loan for example both are good but I think they both have their I think you can tell totally have both yeah but I'm not holding this one I'm not holding dollars though I am well so like I I have a home loan uh I have debt in dollars I love debt debt in dollars isn't it great you ever look at your mortgage and you're just like oh my God that is just inflating away that is getting uh less expensive over time right fantastic meal I've got ether on the other side like that is a beautiful symbiosis for you it is definitely for me I don't know what it does to society I mean that this is what we're grappling with um yeah this is Chris berninski's take on this on this whole thing David which is uh he says this um maybe this kind of sums up the discussion we've had a number of people asking me what I think about in the context of the current baking crisis regulatory fights biology's bet and so on so here it goes current banking crisis is bullish for crypto long run short term we're likely in the eye of the storm so expect volatility but the banking crisis has been a monetary induced policy too much too fast with rate hikes and will be solved by monetary policy fed and other central banks will drop rates perhaps even this year as the market is now anticipating which will allow existing bonds to rally and voila banks that are currently struggling will have healthy balance sheets again in quotes this banking crisis is also more likely to cause disinflation than hyperinflation in Chris's opinion credit is drying up that's interesting btfp isn't the same as stemmy's stimmies went straight to consumer spending whereas btfp is showing up bank balance sheets which is likely to just sit there but disinflation will give the fed and the other central banks cover to lower rates and that will breathe air back into the fire of growth stocks and crypto turning regulation and crypto and then he ends with this as for biology's bet I don't take him literally but more as directionally alerting people in this distracted day and age sometimes you need to do severe things to get people's attention he's done that but as I said earlier I think disinflation from here is more likely than hyperinflation at least for the coming years really interesting take here is um biology was kind of being intentionally nomadic about this and the bit signal 90 days a million dollar Bitcoin bet that was him intentionally kind of being hypermark about this he said he said he wasn't doing that yep I know he's he said on the podcast that this is not him doing a marketing stunt yeah well so I another reasonable take from Chris and uh I guess we'll see uh we are what you know 80 days left 75 days left yeah speaking of upcoming dates what do we got happening pretty soon David uh we got withdrawals happening pretty soon Ryan uh ether withdrawals coming uh the date is April what's the date if you scroll down I can read it up because I don't have it memorized April 12th April 12th and so LSD tokens are getting uh a nice little bump in their price because of the incoming uh uh Shanghai upgrade so this is when we can as validators withdraw our ether and ether just gets violently sold into the market and The Ether goes to zero crashes yeah that's what happens next well what do you think is going to happen in at withdraw it's up or down prices go up number go down what do you think flat flat yeah staking tokens going on flat first first flat maybe for a week maybe for two weeks and then people will realize that it was quite literally a bullish unlock in the sense that the stickers aren't dumping their ether because stakers are inherently bullish either and then people will realize that everyone that hasn't bought ether in the last month because they're fearful of the staking withdrawal unlock are gonna be like oh it's over and the sakers didn't sell well I'll guess I'll buy back my ether and then David David thinks the unlock will be bullish it'll be flashing bullish and then bullish yeah I don't have a strong opinion on that so I'll just take yours sounds good David uh tell me about arbitrary are you surprised that my conclusion is that it's bullish are you surprised about that opinion I'm not David I'm not surprised let's talk about arbitrim though so they had a token launch was that last week last week before it launched just last week it was announced two weeks ago it was a long time right right it's all blurring to me arbitrim uh total locked value jumped a nice two billion dollars you can see yeah on Layer Two beat and uh there was also some reports of airdrop farming what is this tweet David yeah so this is a tweet of what looks like just uh one device emulating what looks like hundreds of devices and I can only assume processing transactions on arbitrum so this is what a modern day airdrop Farm looks like um uh I'm still yet to see an analysis a report of the farmed nature of the Arab airdrop um like 600 000 addresses and we didn't know what percentage of them might be farmed hopefully it's low but you're worried that it might be I'm sure the efforts of the Arbitron airdrop like curation like the criteria pruned away like 90 of at least 90 of the airdrop Farmers efforts but like ninety percent like they need to have well it is what it is ideally they would print away a hundred pruning away 100 is damn near impossible how close to 100 did they get is the million dollar question and I have yet to see an answer to that question how successful were airdrop Farmers we do not know the answer to that uh decentralized exchanges seem to be recently successful this is Hayden Adams tweeting Dex versus centralized exchange I don't know what to say you're not you're not gonna say sex uh Dex versus sex volume is at an all-time high of 25 since the FTX collapse uh pretty incredible on the back of new all-time high decentralized exchanges are crushing it um this is a tweet about have you ever wondered David how much eth is is just lost forever I actually wonder about that quite a lot okay well um this is Connor and he's got the answer for you want to read this thanks Conor uh Connor says uh I've categorized thousands of instances of ethereum typos user errors and buggy contracts thus far I found 636 000 ether about 1.15 billion dollars that is lost forever and I'm assuming verifiably lost forever which is about half a percent of the circulating Supply so that's a lot that's not a small amount that's not a small amount and you can see where he came up with some of these numbers the parity wallet bug oh my God that's almost like that sucks yeah that's almost like 0.5 alone that's a good piece of ethereum History lore that I bet you a lot of 2021 uh crypto people don't know too much about oh okay well why why don't you tell them uh oh God it's such a crazy story man uh so there was this library of code I don't know um this is stretching my developers like technical ability to tell the story but like there was this Library code based library or something and a junior Dev on uh the parody team was messing around with it and sent this very Infamous message um to I think inside the parody slack that says something along the lines of oops I accidentally killed it he accidentally deleted the code library or something which basically froze the multi-sig for parity uh parody was a consensus client um that um didn't how did they get all that either my memory of this is this is a polka dot raise they basically put it in a uh in a wallet a smart contract like a multi-sig type early prototypes that wasn't diagnosis safe it was their own custom-made uh multisig yup and the bug uh caused a billion dollars worth of eth now to be stranded there forever and locked forever so yeah the message is I think I killed it that is terrible um unfortunate but that means point five percent which doesn't even include an ultrasound money chart of eth is probably locked forever and it's yeah it's uh that's gonna increase over time that much yeah uh all right David what do we have coming up next coming up next we got the big news of the week Gary Gensler goes to the principal's office which yeah I'm sure everyone is listening to would love to talk about that but first we're gonna have to talk about binance getting busted by the cftc and we'll give our takes about that how serious of a deal that is uh ZK EVMS an Oiler update SBF managed to get in trouble again so we'll talk about that and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible especially Kraken our recommended crypto exchange because Kraken has been here for 12 years and I can only assume they're going to be for at least 12 years more if not the entire rest of crypto which is why if you are

earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable NF T's any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop binance gets busted David the cftc sued binance over what they say are regulatory violations this is a press release from the cftc what is going on here yeah so the cftc has filed a civil enforcement action charging CZ and three entities that operate the binance platform with numerous violations of the commodity exchange act and other cftc regulations so this complaint charges that binance Holdings limited binance Holdings IE limited and binance services Holdings Limited together Finance man that's a lot of entities and that's not all of them operate the binance centralized digital asset trading platform along with number of other corporate vehicles through an intentionally opaque common Enterprise with CZ at the helm as binance's owner and chief executive officer the defendants allegedly chose to knowingly disregard applicable provisions of the Commodities Enforcement Act while engaging in a calculated strategy of regulatory Arbitrage to their commercial benefit okay let me summarize that tldr cftc is suing binance NCC on allegations that the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products inside the United States against federal law crypto derivative is like a future or something yes they didn't get the cftc's blessing exactly yeah uh directed U.S customers to evade compliance controls through vpns poorly super advise its business didn't implement kyc or email AML processes and had also had a poor anti-invasion program and also they never registered as a compliant Futures commission's Merchant and so the cftc in continuing litigation against its defendants the agency seeks disgorgement civil monetary penalties permanent trading and registration bans and a permanent injunction against further violations of the cea and cftc regulations this this is interesting David this is not a charge of fraud seems like it's basically it's all right you did not follow them yeah file the paperwork and register for your you know derivatives products and you didn't do the AML kyc stuff that uh is required by U.S financial law the cftc um this is not like an SPF you're running a Ponzi scheme there's you know the assets aren't backed type of charge I don't even think it's the the uh the same type of charge that um bitfinex was charged with uh which was some of his but wasn't there also bitmax excuse me well bitmax was charged with violating the bank secrecy act which is a massive deal right um so what what does all this mean what like what's your take on this uh well there's there's some other things in this report as well so there's a link in the show notes to to read the report there are some pretty damning things and so here here's a link there is a thread of we are looking at one tweet in a very long thread of a summary of this report and so I'll read this one tweet to kind of indicate the more egregious side of things if instead of just like failing to do kyc and registering so uh reading from the report here internally binance officers employees and agents have acknowledged that the binance platform has facilitated potentially illegal activities for example in February 2019 after receiving information regarding Hamas transactions on binance uh lim a binance executive explained to a colleague that terrorists usually send small sums as large sums constitute money laundering uh so they send small money through buying hands because they don't want to send large money because large money triggers the flags so the colleague applied uh six you can barely buy an AK-47 with 600 bucks and with regard to certain binance customers including customers from Russia Lim acknowledged that in a February 2022 chat the quote is like come on they are here for crime binance is mlro I don't know what that is agreed that we see the bad but we close two eyes uh and so like the the more direct charge that's being made here is binance was the host of a very significant amount of money laundering and they just completely were aware of that and just looked the other way maybe perhaps totally obviously totally willingly so that's the more damning charge that's going on here yeah and I also don't think that's any surprise to anyone in the crypto industry like I I guess without any evidence I totally assume that that's what's going on yeah it's it's just interesting I I guess the posture here is okay cftc uh understood um but at the same time they're going after binance they're also going after not the cftc but U.S Regulators they're going after coinbase I mean we just talked about that right last week like shutting down coinbase staking um the wells noticed to coinbase from the SEC and I know that coinbase is much more thorough being us located on AML and kyc acts so I you know I don't know um I understand it I understand why the cftc is doing this what is um finance's response to this complaint yeah so CZ made a response to the cftc complaint so I'll just read the first two sentences here today the cftc filed an unexpected and disappointing civil complaint despite our working cooperatively with the cftc for over two years upon an initial review the complaint appears to contain an incomplete recitation effects and we do not agree with the characterization of many of the issues alleged in the complaint basically CDC saying like uh if I they're gonna fight back uh I I'll I'll assert again and I'll stay say it without evidence that I with talking with me he and my friends and this the chats that we have like everyone kind of assumes that CZ and binance was allowing a bunch of money laundering to process through their change I know uh a friend perhaps that has logged into binance while under a VPN while binance has not been allowing us customers and was still able to trade under on binance that is like an open thing that the industry has been doing Americans has been doing we've all known that that's an easy and trivial thing to do you just use a VPN I'm just saying this is what my friend did would use a VPN and then get in and get out and like that's been an Open Secret that the entire industry has known so I don't think anyone is surprised that like a bunch of illegal money laundering has been going through binance uh and so the fact that this is happening is like no surprise to me and I think an inevitable conclusion today is the finally the day and the bookcase for this is that binance pays a fine they settle with the cftc uh and and maybe even gets the green light to uh they can argue some of the things like permanent uh dismantling or whatever they can they can fight that in court but hopefully this actually starts a conversation which makes binance perhaps more jurisdictionally friendly with us it's very interesting to me because I guess they have because they have the power to do AML kyc checks and because they have sort of the you know big big red button to to ban someone or to allow them to stop logging in that they're now responsible for that which is very interesting um and as a contrast to like a D5 protocol right which has no control over these things so the unit swap code base um it has no ability to differentiate the money the identity anything else and I guess if you are this this also not only does it sort of push some of these centralized platforms to to button up which is what you're saying pay the fee and then button up I think that's probably the the hopeful outcome that binance would have it also pushes things more towards decentralized protocols where no one has the ability to do the AML kyc ban someone you know push the button where it's kind of completely open and um you know the cftc can't go I guess maybe they can try to sanction code next right which is where they what they did yeah um didn't try but the powers that B did yeah interesting stuff interesting stuff um okay two more bits of news on this thread is that in the lawsuit the cftc versus binance holding clearly states that Bitcoin ether and Litecoin are all Commodities uh the implication of this is that perhaps on an alternative world the SEC might have sued someone else saying that these things were Securities uh but the cftc is saying they're Commodities which is like a pro this is a proxy war between they just stuck that in there and the SEC yeah right yeah you think Gary Gensler read that and was like just pissed off uh I'm sure he read it on Twitter yeah and his mentions yeah uh David the war on crypto seems like it is continuing there was a an economic report from the president that came out last week there had an entire chapter this is like 90 Pages called digital assets relearning economic principles is kind of like oh do you mean the world of money and finance no no relearning economic principles is what it was called there was a you know I read uh parts of this not the entire thing but like it felt like 90 pages of just fud being like um okay so let me offer you read this did you I skimmed it today wow uh cryptocurrencies don't offer any fundamental value nor are they a better alternative to Fiat money or more effective payment system instead their innovation has been mostly about creating artificial scarcity in order to support crypto assets prices and of course the conclusion David the report uh continues is that the nation's Financial infrastructure has the potential to offer these same benefits they're basically like yeah that crypto thing is a you know a scam ponzis get rich quick uh and we could you know what people should be using is our Central Bank digital currency our existing Financial system there is no need for cryptocurrency it's just a bunch of grifters and scammers and the real solution that they're looking for is of course the FED coin the Central Bank digital currency that is the conclusion of this report hey man water wet skies blue you and I are bullish ether and the United States wants you to use the dollar like this is this is just what it is I I look it's is it the United States it's definitely the white house right now I will say that maybe there are other factions the powers that be in the United States yeah this is Fred Erickson 15 he says of the annual White House report is devoted to crypto fud uh I uh I have a question for you the admirable that you even skim this thing I have a question for you though David which is uh something that's been on my mind lately um the last you know two to three weeks uh as sort of the the anti-crypto and the pro crypto sides um some of that argumentation has reached maybe a fever pitch at least a local high do you think the U.S will ever make it illegal to own cryptocurrency like flat out ban you as a you as a citizen you must turn in your crypto kind of uh executive order 6102 remember that where FDR banned gold basically you had to sell it back to the government and individual American citizen could not own more than some amount of of gold um you know basically melt down your jewelry melt down your gold and sell it back to the Feds that that's what actually happened in the early 1930s and by the way that that law was in existence for like 40 years didn't get that reversed until like the 1970s um do you think that could happen with crypto no no absolutely not why do you not think that because they have a court of law where you will sue them but it did happen in the United States in the 1930s and there was a court there were courts of law it's not like the 1970s no no Executives were in a different Society now I happen to be outside the United States if that law ever got passed I would not be coming back um yeah well that's that you know that's interesting I I haven't read much up on the kind of the 1930s if similar gold hoarders uh made that choice and by the way that's what they were called gold hoarders this is sort of the the vitriol which is basically like um you must hate you're not a patriot you're just hoarding you're agreed you're defecting from the coordination this is a public good we need to all maintain our Fiat currencies right exactly very very anti-anti kind of capitalist anti sort of like do it for the public do it for the the social good right I guess what I'm seeing David is is similar narrative uh sentiments starting Ben's hunt pushback against biology where he's like you know you're causing a bank run biology by even saying this and biology is saying I'm just telling people to get to the lifeboats are you are you against lifeboats if if the ship is in Sinking you have nothing to worry about Ben and Ben is pointing at biology and saying you're causing this right what about kind of the social good of keeping the system intact what we lose all of these things if everyone flees to the life wrap I'm seeing the seeds of this this kind of idea of like crypto hoarders crypto Bros I'm seeing it so I don't know why you're so convinced this couldn't happen in the United States I totally think it could um I put a poll out by the way and I asked the question will the US ever make it legal to own uh cryptocurrency followers on Twitter said no 60 yeah this is a surprisingly I just don't know why you think it's not possible but you're just saying that um Society has been I mean it is certainly possible but yes it's a progression of society it's a progression of Technology things were more extreme back then uh like that was an extreme time in people's lives like pre-internet times dude we had like Nazism that was an extreme time right I think we are entering some pretty extreme not not quite 19 uh 20s 1930s level like late 1920s but like things have gotten a lot more extreme than like when I grew up in the 90s I I think even I think we've adapted as a society I think the the internet allows information to spread it allows us to learn from history faster like I don't think it would be possible for us I'm reading a bit of History lately uh I don't think it would be possible for us to have um uh like the the 60 million deaths as a result of just like a mind virus of Communism in Soviet Russia because if we had the internet I don't think that that would have been possible uh I don't think that we would have I think when there's just uh imperfect information and just the way that the society Works back in those days I think extreme circumstances were allowed to rise much more than in today's world uh and really I think I totally I totally think this is possible this whole scenario I totally think 60 million 100 million deaths could happen in the you know in the in the 21st century but that aside let's talk about this specifically which is the U.S could make it illegal to own cryptocurrency I think the first step toward that wouldn't be just a flat out ban it would be basically a choking off of Fiat to crypto exchange there's other ways to do this yeah we're already seeing a little bit of that David like we are one step down that path and the next step would be like sure you can buy crypto on an exchange you're an ETF but you can't withdraw to your um like just take coinbase take Kraken no more withdrawals to notice that seems much more possible to me well and then and then it's basically and then after that the next step would be if we ever get to this step would be yeah and by the way a bunch of crypto bro hoarders turn in your cryptocurrency yeah make it make it sounded version yeah for sell you have to exchange it for this ETF version of it I'm I'm not like I still sign like that seems slightly more plausible I can see this I still think like this is 10 probability but like if hits the fan yeah I'm saying if if it depends on how if central banks are actually threatened right as they were in the 19 1930s like kind of and and then they you know politicians and Society sort of rallies around yeah we have to be in this together it's like War times is bad times you can't you can't leave on the Lifeboat right yeah things get worse if everyone leaves on the on the Lifeboat I could see it happening but I'm gonna be I'm being pessimistic here anyway I wanted to have that conversation with you I'm glad we had that yeah now I didn't know that I had to think about that but now I do uh let's take this to the courts crypto also has Defenders even outside of crypto so David you said one of our recourses is the court system certainly the United States does have a court system and uh this is a white paper courtesy of Cooper and Kirk which is a law firm that is actually they've they've previously sued the FDIC and the OCC and the FED over operation choke point 1.0 which was the choking off of certain industries like marijuana industry from the banking system and now they are alleging in this white paper that the US government is doing the same thing to crypto what's the summary of this uh report uh yeah they sent a letter to U.S Congress regarding the clandestine Financial war against the cryptocurrency industry urging Congress to hold agencies accountable and propose questions and steps to obtain answers they are claiming that Regulators are using regulatory tools and and pressure tactics to prevent crypto integration to the financial system and that it's up to Congress to hold Federal Banking Regulators accountable now Ryan I was not here during the time in which gold was made illegal but I would imagine maybe there was stuff like this maybe I'm being naive but this is an example of like the pushback that comes very early and very hard by a very engaged community that perhaps I don't think we had way back then uh and so this isn't any action this is just a letter that is drafted by a law firm um making but you know it it is allowing the world the people of the United States to have the foundation to stand on to air their grievances yep it's basically executive branches is kind of forcing this and we have two places we can we can go to fight it judicial which is the court system which is what they're attempting to do and they're also calling on Congress to push back against it speaking of congress Gary Gensler he's got to go in front of Congress is that what's happening yeah Gary Gensler to face Congress grilling over crypto policy is the headline so Gary Gensler is going to testify before the testified Gary Gensler is going to testify oh man you sound Getty before the house Financial Services committee uh it's chairman Patrick McHenry has confirmed that this is going to happen this is going to happen on April 18th uh and he will face questions over his approach towards the crypto ecosystem Gary is going into the hot seat I'm sure he's going to prep for this there's no way that he isn't like cognizant and intentional about his strategy towards the crypto world so I'm sure he's going to come with a pre-prepared list of deflections saying something like he's already said I just looked towards the Supreme Court for guidance I apply the rules of the Securities laws that have been established before me I'm sure he's just do you want to take a shot every time he says Howie test yeah oh I mean I I don't want to die but but that's a fun game this is uh this is kind of interesting because I have observed this too there does seem to be increased partisanship over crypto I would not have said this two years ago that you know one one uh party was more pro-crypto than the other it seems sort of about even and both were kind of like almost neutral on it but that has started to change what is this tweet that we've pulled up here yeah this is a tweet from Dennis Porter who is a bitcoiner that we've actually had on decklist before and he tweets out a pro crypto and pro Bitcoin Democrats are lining up to voice their opposition to their own party stance Democrats are on the verge of driving away their own voters and losing support from this important new voter Block in my opinion it could cost Democrats to 2024 election and then there are screenshots of four crypto Twitter personas who are saying that they are perhaps reconsidering their previous Democratic base in support of the Republican party if indeed the Republican candidate was sufficiently Pro crypto and I'm sure other facts and circumstances as well this is someone saying um I have never once voted for a Republican president but is considering this um this is also Chris berninski and we quoted earlier crypto is going to be an issue for voters in 2024 and already that is a sign of us winning but I have also never seen the U.S government be so Draconian in fact so long as it's not trump it may cause me to vote Republican for the first time in my life it's very interesting I know you have a weigh-in on this too started here yeah okay what's what's your take on this yeah so I am one of the four people that are that is being screenshotted and and tweeted out by by uh Dennis and I said my entire family is Democrat um I I was once considered myself a Democrat and now I kind of consider myself just politically agnostic uh great party great great party yeah that's a great way to put it um I was once a Bernie bro because of Hillary so I'm putting my political opinions out here sorry for that um I too would vote Republican for the first time given that it is the correct Pro cryptocam candidate and also the Dems continued on the anti-crypto war path since I'm here uh grandstanding about my political opinions I also followed up this tweet with another tweet saying and that Republican would also have to be pro-choice that's how what I believe and so like if for me my personal uh political beliefs are that uh I'll vote on almost a single issue voter for crypto uh so long as that candidate is not an insane person I will vote for the pro crypto candidate it's definitely it's definitely making you question right uh previous political beliefs over of this one thing and it could start to cost the the Democrats is that a popular position in your family David uh it is not and so so actually so growing back to Chris berniski's tweet I shared Chris bernick's tweet with my in my family chat and because my entire family is like pretty thumbs up about Elizabeth Warren and I just said hey guys like my entire industry thinks that Elizabeth Warren is super cringe and not treating us with respect and is actually doing the whole Emperors wearing no clothes thing because the way she talks about our industry is coming from a place of completely just misunderstanding and being uninformed about things and it's making our entire industry not just question her stance and information about crypto but basically her stance and information about any other industry is kind of like when you when you understand how the mainstream media reports on crypto and you're like well they just got that wrong and and so are is that how they report about everything because they're getting better wrong and so what about everything else I think that's true although I will say one thing is it just I think people are inherently skeptical of like industry bias right sure there's like big Pharma there's you know the you know the gun lobby all of these things and big Banking and big crypto that could be a thing crypto is not big crypto but like crypto Bros that sort of thing to me this is less about an industry fighting for um like its ability to exist and survive although that's part of it to me this goes far deeper than that this is like a basic like American civil liberty to own freaking digital property right like this is this this is something that embodies American values this is deep the level of like constitutional like this is freedom of speech this is digital civil liberties and and to me this is not a about like one a kind of party um helping and getting donations from crypto or not or getting the crypto this is just like why can't we all rally around this being like core to a western classically liberal democracy that embodies uh human values and translates that for the digital age that's what crypto is to me um I don't know if that's uh an effective argument on anyone in your family but that's certainly what I believe and this is also increasingly what uh I think some some politicians are giving voice to so we had Tom emmer on the podcast earlier this week David and I know like you were on at the beginning you had some internet connectivity and then uh you were not fully established here in Montenegro dude you should see how fired up he was I'm looking like the thumbnail man I I is this a thumbnail from the com yes that I think I saw that face during he is so fired up and we talked to him a year ago so we talked to Tom emmer a year ago and he's Pro crypto and this this time it was a different Tom emmer different politician he clearly thinks that um crypto is going to I don't know his motivation but assume he's just kind of a politician going with the votes and that sort of thing he clearly thinks that this is a Cornerstone of his platform and I think David because he is the whip in the house that is number two most powerful seat in House of Representatives I think this could become a platform for Republicans because the Democrats are letting them have it for the Republicans it's like this is free real estate basically and somebody's got to go get that cohort of votes and we've got a two-party system so it's going to be either one party the other and by the way the more one party Embraces it the more the other party has to be like we're not those guys right so that's just how they stand for that we don't stand for that yeah so anyway I I don't know how it's all gonna unfold it's really this quartz it should be a bipartisan just American issue but it does seem like the Republicans are kind of making this part of their platform we'll see how that carries in 2024. right when I was so when I was arguing with my uh my sister is perhaps the leader of my uh family in the pro-war inside of things and she was like yeah you could you crypto Bros like you think you don't need regulation like look what happened to crypto in the last year I'm like are you serious Elizabeth Warren is saying like she's trying to position us as these like Rogue shadowy supercoders who don't want any regulation and my response to her is like no you're doing the same thing that she is which is misunderstanding and misrepresenting our industry and casting us off as like these barbarians crypto like Gunslingers anarchists please regulate us please you're gonna get eclipsed by this by the way somebody's gonna clip that please regulate us David Hoffman you're saying clarify before you get clipped on uh what you're actually saying so if you can be regulated if you are a centralized entity if you are a bank if you have uh if you have to if somebody deposits trust into you you are in need of Regulation if you are a decentralized protocol that is permissionless and or also aspires to be permissionless and you need a path to become permissionless I mean regulation isn't just like clamping down the gates it's also providing Clarity and paths forward for crypto protocols to mature that's for it right absolutely yeah uh so internet get the full clip all right don't just don't just clip David saying please regulate us oh my God crypto bro like screaming from bleeding from his eyeballs one speculation crying no crying yeah right well you know what Gary Gensler you'll be happy to know says uh David the rules are already clear this is sec's Gensler insisting clear root rules for the crypto Market already exist but the regulator says the digital asset industry is Rife with non-compliance you already have all of the rules in front of you it's perfect clarity I've already explained this to you in office hours with Gary your problem is you're just non-compliant that's what Gary says um Thanksgiving I'm looking forward for you testifying by the way in front of emmer too what's Emma gonna do get him Tom okay uh this is going on in the meanwhile Dave and this is just a contrast point maybe we'll end this section here the freest country in the world AKA what America purports to be is choking off crypto while Hong Kong is opening the floodgates do you see this I am including a Bloomberg article Hong Kong Regulators dosed Meetup to help crypto firms with banking here how you're just talking about like politicians filling the vacuum free real estate free space here is exactly what Hong Kong is doing right coming out of Hong Kong can you believe this being like okay if New York City the US government doesn't want to be part of this crypto Revolution doesn't want to be sort of a Nexus for uh Finance in this world then we will be and I think it's straight embarrassing for the United States and this is the take that Tom emmer had which I which I share is America just going to build its future on debt are we actually going to build something again that's a question and crypto is like a new generation of the Internet it's an invitation to go build things here and what we're doing with these policies and all of the uh marvelous Clarity Gary Gensler is giving us is driving Builders offshore outside of the United States you are not welcome here at crypto entrepreneur and if we keep doing that uh it's not going to be good for the United States crypto will be fine it's just not going to be good for the US um maybe we'll end it there what do we got coming up next oh boy that was a wild man okay coming up next two more zkm DK EVMS land on the ethereum main net we got some good news out of Oiler maker Dow has a new path for die SBF gets in trouble amazingly the guy just came can't stop can't stop him and then AI training I'm talking about

doubled in two weeks this is polygons ZK evm tell us about it uh so yeah polygons ekm it's eke evm long awaited just shipped to mainnet uh Ryan Sean Adams my co-host here had a fantastic show with uh with uh uh Jordy balina and me Hollow from from polygon Jordy fun fact previously I actually love this story because I was on I was it was me this is going to be a deep cut of a story it was me Mariano Conte and me Hollow and ECC 2021 I had just come off out of my scooter accident if you remember that uh black eyed everything yeah yeah yeah no no just a black guy I didn't lose anything yeah no she's a black eye did you could chip a tooth or something he went to this yeah I chipped a tiny little tooth and then it came back yeah it grew back yeah okay wow anyways uh that was like so fast forward like four weeks into ECC I still had a little you know a little bit of puffiness anyways uh it was me Mariano Conti uh one the guy that deployed made multiclateral diet maker in like 2019 we were just getting a beer towards the end of ECC and miharlo gets a phone call he looks at it steps immediately up and goes and answers it and me and Mariano just continue having a beer and then mihalo comes back with a Overjoyed like facial expression uh and we were like dude what was that and he was like dope good news man good news I can't tell you it was this it was this it was the polygon acquisition of uh ZK Hermes of Hermes which was Jordy ballina's project which is the man that you see on the screen to the left and fast forward to where we are today this is the culmination of that phone call of that that a partnership agreement and now we have the zke evm live on mainnet and so that was what was launched uh when was that launched on Tuesday or Tuesday of this week yeah on Tuesday and Heath as the gas token Matic is the payment to validators okay we've got a full interview if you want to check that out and the cool thing is how fast and furious the CK EVMS are are now coming I I feel like this is crypto's broadband moment this is ethereum's broadband moment at least um David we just got our second but here's consensus coming out and introducing a third man okay Lena it's called a developer ready ZK roll-up powered by consensus I haven't investigated this but they're just coming out of the woodwork now we got TK evm Suddenly It's March 2023 and we got block space you want block space where ether is selling block space Oh My Gosh speaking of block space uh Layer Two beat all right I I love layers because they provide transparency to all of these Roll-Ups that are coming to the market and as we multiply our Chains It's hard to know what the what the decentralization and security guarantees are on each of these chains did you see this they added this um little kind of pie chart uh what are we looking at here yeah so this is a five there's a think of this like an orange slice for the podcast listeners an orange slice with five slices and each of these slices can be various colors uh gray yellow red and I'm assuming I'm assuming green maybe actually we don't see any green yet because there's nothing green yet um this is an orange slice of um what the risks security risks yeah so there's five different like things that all roll ups need to be secure on data availability uh where is the data stored uh and can that data be rugged upgradeability uh validator failure sequencer failure and state validation all roll ups need to improve on this on all five of these things and so this pie chart that you can see um I actually am still confused as a whether or not uh sorry there are only three colors uh there are is gray yellow and red and uh okay man they should really make gray green uh gray is green intuitively gray is green green doesn't great it's good great great gray is good yeah so there's gray uh yellow and red and so you can see the characterization uh a snapshot of what the security risks for every single layer 2 are and what they have to work on basically you want your orange slices you you want the whole thing the whole circle to be all great great closely bar Tech come on can we get this in Korean we and the closest is arbitrum one right which has uh two orange slices out of five and it's yes you just said orange slices but there's no orange color okay David is actually talking about the orange not yellow I'm worried that people will still see it like man color orange we totally screwed this up but we are not editing this out all right this is raw unfiltered bankless materials all we're trying to say is go to layer2beat.com if you want to check in on the risks associated with your layers get it out of here Oiler good news David Euler the exploiter uh return 51 and actually even more than that because there was another transaction that returned another 7 000 ether there was also another transaction that I've returned something like 20 million die uh they got 84 of their funds back 84 of oil or exploited funds are returned that is if you had told me that we're going to get 84 of funds back the day it was actually I was like wow that is unheard of that's pretty good let me ask you here what what what are these criminals doing I I wasn't following the story so like you go you hack something you you hack like 150 million dollars and then you go and a week later two weeks later you return 84 of it who does this like what is happening here so there's there's two routes so understanding that my first take on the first exploit was like man this is totally North Korea because they immediately went into tornado cash implying that they had no intent on returning the funds um and so follow up on the story and I'll give my take after this is in a series of messages written into the data of transactions on the ethereum blockchain the exploiter says this jacob here I don't think what I will say will help me in any way but I still want to say it I up I didn't want to but I messed up with others monies others jobs and others lives I really up I'm sorry I didn't mean all that I really didn't mean all of that forgive me and in another transaction he says Jacob apparently the rest of the money will be returned ASAP I only look after my safety and that is the reason for the delay I'm sorry for any misunderstanding implying if we're taking this if we're taking Jacob seriously uh that we are going to be getting 100 back of oil or exported funds so it was either two things two one of two things happened maybe both um one law enforcement found him and said hey man you were going to jail if you don't return the funds right now you're going to go to jail for like a big time if you return the funds only right now you will only be go to jail for a little bit something like this something along this line that's how it works yeah that's how it works so it's directionally correct uh the other one is like he actually felt bad about all of the lives that he damaged and so he returned it out of guilt but then yeah there David I'm gonna go with option A because he I mean assuming Jacob's his actual name he was like yo the gig is up you guys got me uh here's all the money back and it's also me doing this I'm sorry here's your money sorry I'm sorry you say crypto Rock like worst robbers in history imagine going like you know stealing something from a bank and then like returning a week later being like hey guys I'm sorry I met I was going through a rough patch yeah here's the money I didn't think of the consequences I really didn't think about it I'm sorry it's so strange uh well such as crypto and these yeah good news negotiations yeah uh maker what's a new era has begun chapter zero what are we looking at here uh we are looking at a promotional graphic uh if you turn on the sound it doesn't say anything it is just music uh so I actually was trying to get the details of what this announcement means and um I didn't there wasn't too much there uh I went into the governance forums I opened up the links I looked at what was being proposed man it's make a really bureaucratic uh and so uh they are tweeting out chapter zero a new era has begun uh a governance proposal has passed that ratifies a new Constitution which includes four maker Dow to one increasingly decentralized the collateral backs die and I think the big obvious low hanging fruit here is removing dependence on uscc but perhaps also for real world assets second allowing dye to free float relative to the dollar this was an original idea for maker dial that has kind of been pushed to the back burner for a very long time now but now is returning uh questionable also questionable is the timeline on this I don't know how like is that this year or or are we just saying that we still want to do this I don't know and also improvements to the actual governance process of maker Dao um and they also said that they are going to limit real world asset collateral these are the notes that I have from Christy thank you Christy who did more research than me but man is finding out what this actual announcement is actually really confusing uh if someone can summarize this for me they'd be really appreciated my high level take on it was they want to go less in the direction of real world assets and more in the direction of crypto native assets because the real world is looking a little anti-crypto these days yeah but probably that's not what they did um Ticketmaster is doing nft stuff this is cool okay but I thought Ticketmaster was the villain since they uh jacked up those uh Taylor Swift concerts and uh you know I resent them being associated with crypto but you tell me this is a good thing uh if you accepted that face value um which maybe I'm overly optimistic and bullish on Humanity but I will uh Ticketmaster has launched the ability for artists to offer token gated ticket sales meaning that a sale can only be unlocked or accessed with a specific nft they've launched they've launched a token gated option for special access to concerts and event tickets for eligible nft holders and they also have a suite of artist-driven tools offering many unique ticketing services including face value Ticket Exchange a program that limits transfer and locks in resale prices at face value I don't know if that is done by a smart contract but in theory it could uh verified fan and registration system that filters out scalpers and Bots uh user and and Bot users who are looking to acquire tickets for the purpose of reselling and Ticketmaster requests service that eliminates the traditional on sale Rush by allowing artists who sell tickets to high demand shows through a fulfillment and request model during the purchasing process Ticketmaster prompts a user to connect a wallet to verify ownership of an nft after that it's the same buying process so token gated access to buying some nfts along with some other Equitable tools and services that in theory could all be smart contracts but it wasn't cited whether they are or not um Ticketmaster I wouldn't go that far David but look this is a pretty big deal actually Ticketmaster is absolutely massive these these tokens are minted on ethereum and accessible via metamask and coinbase this is onboarding more people to kind of nfts I think in any other like you know news cycle or week or like in a world where Ticketmaster was less hated at this specific moment of time we probably would have led the episode with this probably this is actually yeah huge news in terms of the thing that we care most about which is is like onboarding the world to crypto and web three um pretty big and I think it's fair to be skeptical about Ticketmaster just by nature of what there are and their incentives sure and also at the same time it's also Fair too except that this maybe it's on Ticketmaster but is coming like verifiable tickets as tokens on ethereum by some someone somewhere um I bet you Gary thinks these are securities oh God do you want to ask him um yeah come on the podcast Gary we'll ask you come out of this that's the only way we can find out um come to office hours with David and Ryan microstrategy they just bought more Bitcoin there you go 6 455 new Bitcoins to come to a total amount of Bitcoins of 138 955. they also paid off a loan that was collateralized by Bitcoin we tried to unpack it and really understand it something else happened but anyways um Microsoft you bought more Bitcoin it was a while it was a while since they bought another Bitcoin David you didn't want me to include this uh link but uh we we had some discussion about it do you know how much for the record I told him to not do this let me finish we finish save it okay if microstrategy had purchased eth rather than Bitcoin rather than four billion dollars do you know how much they would have David I'm assuming more more money 6.5 billion dollars almost dollars that they had bought Ethan said David David wanted to talk to us because I told Ryan to not do this yeah uh and I was like you know what I am gas today YouTube viewers will notice that he typed in the URL instead of instead of pulling it up this might get cut by your editors uh we don't I don't know if this will make it but let's talk about this the NASDAQ is launching crypto custody service in Q2 the NASDAQ what are they abandoning stocks David are they uh looking over their shoulder at the crypto walking and they're just totally abandoning all stocks and equities going crypto only that's the news no I'm kidding uh their uh first primarily providing custody services for Bitcoin and ethereum uh this is the top of the rabbit hole of a long list of potential services that they could do it starts with custody kind of cool um Avalanche had an outage last week what happened uh Avalanche uh the sea chain was out of order for uh about 50 minutes haltedly block production uh a bug related to blockchain validation uh they released an update uh this was the second time that this has happened in seven days which triggered me to make a tweet that caused me to fight with a bunch of Solana and Avalanche people and that was more or less my weekend and David sorry about all of that and he takes it all back yes there are some tweets that I could have phrased better there are some tweets that I could have been more precise everything I said I completely believe I've never written a single tweet that I didn't believe in uh there are a couple a couple one or two might be out there because of those ones except those ones yeah yeah except the ones that were deleted later the US is charging SBF for bribing China how much more trouble can this guy get in okay what's what's happening now with Sam bankman free that is the SPF uh sandbagman freed he is charging with paying 40 million dollars to um Chinese officials as a bribe so that they would unfreeze his hedge funds accounts yep that sounds like a crime David uh yep uh well they're frozen for a reason um but I guess it was China that froze them and he paid them 40 million dollars to unfreeze them all right okay well now he's in trouble with two governments I guess um this is uh some AI news which we usually don't cover but I think this is uh important um this is an open letter yep to pause all giant large-scale AI experiments and I I gotta think that this is um maybe not inspired by the bankless podcast with Ellie easer but certainly inspired by Eliezer himself and his caution and concerns about AI safeties issues thankless listeners might know if if you didn't listen to this episode early in the year you catch an archive we had uh Ellie utkowski on who um basically told us we're all going to die because AI is quite literally quite literally going to become super intelligent we're in the process of becoming super intelligent there is no way to keep them aligned with humanity and our ethics and morality and so that would result in the inevitable demise of human beings the AIS would just basically sort our atoms and do something else with them uh so it seems like that's not just him that's concerned about this this is an entire open letter saying to stop to pause all large-scale AI experiments like stop chat gbt4 is what what I'm reading in this article stop all AI Innovation more powerful than chatpt like Armistice like everyone pause everyone stops so this is uh the future of Life Institute which is a non-profit organization that works to reduce Global catastrophic and existential risk facing Humanity particularly particularly from Advanced artificial intelligence so this is a petition that you can go sign it's already signed by Elon Musk Steve Wozniak Gary Marcus yosha bengio who I don't know and others uh if that is David Andrew Yang oh wow yeah wow that's a Max tegmark man oh you need to read some books by Max tegmark uh our mathematical Universe have you read that also life life 3.0 oh great books great books um you would really like these names uh yeah are you gonna sign this David what's your take on this uh uh I don't I need I don't know enough to sign this I don't know I actually really had to consider that for a moment I don't know and I actually I'm worried that um signing a letter is not going to do anything to stop it right because this is a moloch problem right so like say nine people out of ten agree to sign the letter and pause on defects and one defects well then that one person just gets the lead right problem yeah well uh I will have to say that uh the Elias are podcasts that we did like I've heard from multiple people that it had made waves in the AI Community more than it had before and I think it was important that Eliezer did a non-ai podcast for that to reach new audiences and permeate out wound outbound I think this is not necessarily a coincidence that this letter is happening right now look we are not done exploring um AI the AI safety problem and I think our next the next stop for for bankless is to get the kind of the Counterpoint to Ellie's or someone who's a bit more optimistic on AI so we've got some guests lined up in because this is what we do April um so expect to Deep dive there and and this will be a fun piece of trivia the a the AI guests that we have recorded I think we're recording with him next week or maybe the week after week no a couple couple weeks yeah week after uh spoke at East Denver 2018. so if you care to find out who that is there's a little bit of trivia for you all right someone will find out um Dune integrates chat gpt4 well okay uh speaking of is this the crypto plus AI of course um you know conversation this is Doon analytics fantastic dashboard for coming up almost reviewing everything we'll use it so frequently on the roll up to show data it's a kind of a complicated dashboard to operate as a not I haven't really Dove down how to spin up a board but uh I mean I guess data so the reason uses it he'll Dobby uses it we've used dune analytics on the weekly roll up many many times it requires kind of a technical brain to operate this is what's so fascinating though about chat GPT and why I think it's so hard to stop because like like right now it's so damn useful could you imagine going to like you and I don't know SQL um not very good with this we can't construct our own boards wouldn't you love to be able to go to like do an analytics and type in like and just give me the number of addresses um from date you know January to to March that um staked eth boom right outputs an answer like that's what chat gbd4 can do and it's going to consume all of this public available um blockchain data anyway and so that's part of the Mohawk trap is how do you stop it it's so it's too useful to try to shut down all the dune board creators who do like selfless work and create boards for us to view like again like people like Hill Dobby people like data always there's a few others we are now going to be thanking chat gpt4 and their services will no longer be needed sorry guys well the the bookcase is it it uh for them is it allows people to operate on a higher order of rather than constructing the documents you just have to know what questions to ask right yeah because I thought it was funny sorry I'm taking things too seriously because it's the AI topic and it scares me David um well that's cool uh by the way um I am an investor in doing analytics and I don't think we mentioned this you and I are both investors in uh L2 beat um gotta mention this of course all of our disclaimers are always at bankless.com disclaimers David uh metamask is integrating sign in with ethereum much more natively these days what's uh what's this news yeah so this is Bruce ID the Twitter account as Bruce is basically the studio behind signed in with ethereum so sign in with ethereum is now being so like yeah everyone knows they're like you know log in with Facebook log in with Google metamask is now having like a login a sign in button and it is integrating with the sign in with ethereum protocol and so so that is what is being announced here today starting with ethereum integrated with my mask David uh I think we're going to see sign in with ethereum on more websites including including our website right here uh bankless.com has silently added the ability to connect with your eth address look at me doing this connect your wallet they're really safest way to log in all right metamask our favorite wallet and sponsor ever thank you um connecting with an address boom sadly we don't see that part on screen uh sign in to verify identity let's go this is dope we don't see the metamask because uh Zoom doesn't do the screen share for metamask sorry right uh and then I just signed in so I linked my wallet with my bank list citizenship and now I don't have to log in in order to access all bankless citizen content you don't have to log in with your email and password you do get to log in with your ethereum address yeah so when we launched the bank list website it was unequivocally the most one of the most positive responses about the website like everything everybody was positive except for one complaint which was that they that they needed to log in with an email and password that was the one everyone everything was unequivocally positive and this one person was like bankless bad because is signing in with an email address and first off I'll remind you we're a newsletter we need your email address and fast forward however many weeks ago we launched this website for about a month ago now we have signed with ethereum yeah it's just actually it was like two weeks it took us God that was oh two wait when did we launch the website two weeks ago mid yeah two weeks two maybe two and a half Jesus time is weird zoom in all right by the way speaking of uh zoom in fast do you like that uh Kraken exchange just announced an official partnership with Williams Racing and what's cool about this is there's some way that Kraken has provided for you to get your nft potentially on the back of an uh a race car Yep this is a partnership with Williams Racing of F1 so this is F1 Motorsports it's not NASCAR not NASCAR uh European yes uh so New Horizons New Frontiers for Kraken if you will so they have a kraken logo on a race car so kraken's getting a race car and they have real estate on this race car for your listener you that's you your nft could be on the Kraken race car how do you get your NFC do not freaking put your dick butt on the back do not shame my crypto industry I could don't I'm not I'm asking you not to though not to try how do you feel about an MFR he's totally gonna try uh um I feel fine about an MFR okay but not a dick but honestly it whatever you want to do dude it's it's permissionless all right I can't stop you anyway I won't even try uh so the details of how to get your nft on this race car uh is in the in this link in the show notes uh you put your nft I'm assuming this is how this works you put your nft into the Kraken nft platform and then probably sign up I bet you that's how that works there you go okay sponsor Bank list thank you uh also adding Layer Two support which we always appreciate it um you can now send and receive stable coins natively to arbitrum there you go uh David um some other Layer Two releases going on conduit is a crypto native infrastructure program that allows you to launch a roll-up in just a few clicks I'm pretty sure we predicted this feature would be coming like you can no issue the token or the op stack yes yeah so the the whole idea a long long time ago was that the op stack is the erc20 token for Roll-Ups here we have a startup that is executing on that idea so that not only is this a release it's also a raise announcement so this is a startup that raised I think seven million from Paradigm uh and they are one click op stack deployment man that is really really cool uh I think that's really cool yeah that's really cool uh we're gonna have you know you know how it's um uh very easy now like to launch your your own token and that was revolutionary in 20 2016 uh with ethereums basically provided a platform for that now it's going to be just as easy to launch your own entire chain so we're going to have an absolute explosion of chains when it's as easy to spin up a website launch a token as it is an entire chain David we got tokens we got chains we also got jobs David new jobs of the week and I gotta do a shout out for a very important role bankless is hiring for what do we need here uh what we need need is someone to edit this podcast that you are listening to right now we are looking for a podcast video editor slash media operation so if you are familiar with audio and video editing software if you've ever edited a podcast before if you've ever edited a video before we are interested in talking to you especially if you live in EST or european time zones because at bankless Nation never stops producing content so we quite literally need a podcast editors across the globe because Ryan and I produce way too much content at all hours of the day so that is the job if you want to work directly with me and Ryan to edit and produce podcasts uh please click click in the show notes and apply we got uh 30 maybe 40 million downloads I think on the podcast we're trying to get to a 100 million and then a billion that could be a metric you help us reach here um got some other jobs going on too ryze is hiring a marketing manager a sales development representative uniswap needs a senior product designer an application security engineer and a senior mobile engineer who's a react native you can find all of that and more at the bankless job site bankless.palot.com jobs David what do we have coming up next coming up next we got the questions from the nation we're going to talk about whether or not Ryan changed anything about our portfolio as biology uh scared us out of our pants we'll talk about that as well as who was the first CK evm on mainnet and then we got some takes of the week and we got what we're bullish on and then we got some memes of the week there's more than one meme this week so stay tuned because both of them are very very good but first I wanted to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open an educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto metamask learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand giving you actual practical experience for navigating web 3. the purpose of metamask learn is to teach people the basics of self-custody and wallet Security in a safe environment and while metamask learn always takes the time to Define web 3 specific vocabulary it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto curious user friendly not scary metamask learn is available in 10 languages with more to be added soon and it's meant to cater to a global web3 audience so are you tired of having to explain crypto Concepts to your friends go to learn.menimask.io and add metamask learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web 3. arbitrim 1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum one Purdue using flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling arbitrim home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to arborstone Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arboretum.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free we've got the questions of the week this is a question from Big wiggle 501 from the bankless citizen Discord after your chat with Biology does your portfolio remain the same or have you made any changes I think this is a question to you and I did you make any changes after the 90 day Bitcoin bet and our conversation with apology uh I want Ryan you to guess whether I changed anything um no David you did not change a thing in unless there is the slight probability that you just purchased some more eth is my guess I would consider that not changing my strategy so you did it correct yes I will say like during the biology week the Bitcoin the bit bit signal week I was like okay maybe I should perhaps reconsider my position reconsider because you don't have any Bitcoin or you have a little bit of Bitcoin what's your well no technically I'm short Bitcoin because I have sold Bitcoin for ether to do my ether Lego bet I think that that's short Bitcoin relative to eth it's not relative to either not to the dollar I don't think you would be short Bitcoin oh I would never ever be short any crypto asset ever gotta you it's insane why would you I'm offended remember remember the person that got liquidated shorting Luna while it was crashing like no way no way anyways yeah uh so no I did not change anything um I in the while I did like need to like take a moment and like reflected and reconsider it's like okay biology saying this Arthur Hayes also saying this um perhaps this is not the time to have a net short position Against The Ether versus Bitcoin uh I waited until next week to like sleep on it and then reassess and I have decided that I will not do anything so you're you're still bullish on eth relative to bitcoin so you're you're still making a bet on the ratio then too correct I'm doing more correct well like I said that is a 18 plus month long position uh and I don't think anything's changed my position has not changed either um I've been long Bitcoin for a long time but right so right after does own Bitcoin I do uh I have not purchased Bitcoin also in a long time um and uh I will continue purchasing eth I think that um everything that Balaji and Arthur um say um I I don't do this in my mind but like you can kind of substitute ether as an asset I don't think that um biology or Arthur fully understand or believe in the uh monetary premium Virtues Of ethereum in a high conviction way that the URI do I think anything basically that benefits the monetary premium a story of Bitcoin actually um doubly benefits maybe I I shouldn't maybe claim kind of any sort of ratio but yeah right even more so benefits the uh ethereum narrative over the long run so I haven't changed over the long run big emphasis on over the long run because I actually will take biology side that and I do particular biology aside that the banking crisis puts the wind in the sales of the Bitcoin narrative totally and also the long-term ethereum fundamentals but emphasis on long term like that doesn't hit until later but Ryan that is their long-term perspective that you have that you take yeah it was kind it was basic it was more confirmation okay well this is what crypto people have been saying for for a while and it looks like this is this is happening so I haven't changed a thing but what also was really like already way overweight crypto so there's not much I could change I can't get any more bullish all right um this is a related question though if you're going to have an IRA for a seven-year-old crypto friend uh 70 not seven year old how would you diversify into eth Bitcoin so um someone was on the older side in that generation what what would you advise them of a hundred percent so they have there they have their pool of other assets and now they want to know I've got some pool for crypto what should I buy not Financial advice but um if I was a financial advisor who would in theory therefore give financially if this wasn't for entertainment only then entertainment yeah so the 70 the 70 year old is an interesting detail because that implies like you know an end of life phase and so the question is like yeah yeah how healthy is a 70 year old are they living like five more years 20 more years like how much right well I mean like at that point like you have to start to consider these things right and so if we're thinking a five to ten year long time Horizon the shorter the time Horizon the more weight I would go to bitcoin and if we are thinking that this is a a 70 year old yoga person who still goes on runs then I would start to shift more towards ether so if we're thinking short term I would go 50 50 Bitcoin ether because that is my bias towards ether and then you know as soon as we start to hit like 10 to 15 to 20 year long time Horizons I would start to go maybe if we're doing a 20 year long time Horizon I would go 80 ether 20 Bitcoin yeah this is similar to what I would say and uh it's interesting you're not saying any other tokens but like so it'd just be Ethan Bitcoin right um I I mean if they want to hear my shitcoin portfolio my and either 20 30 Bitcoin and I would do that eth a portion of that nice staked eth I mean if you are um in your 70s like how nice is it to have some sort of fixed income asset as well so you have the option to kind of sell it as it comes in or or keep it uh and that is something that that each staking provides uh and it's it's pretty unique so I definitely overweight on eth either 70 to 80 percent but I would have some Bitcoin it wouldn't be zero percent for a seven year old um I think that's right yeah okay by the way I say the term coins like endearingly like I love my  coins I don't think I don't think they're shitty I love tournament endearment yes uh this is a rocket pollster question who really was the first ZK evm to mainnet who won David yeah so like oh I'll put a metaphor you know when like uh I've did this to my sibling um you know when like a sibling like licks something to something yeah that's kind of what happened with the ZK EVMS it's like that one just like you know stuck out of technicality yeah exactly uh ZK sync was technically first B polygon by a few days I will have to say ZK Sync has been around for since 2017 2018 we were processing Bitcoin transactions with ZK sync the first DK sync roll up uh which was a ZK roll up not a ZK evm but so but it has been around for a while the fact that polygon is anywhere close to that is like a huge tip of the hat to the polygon engineering team for catching up to to um to ZK sync first there you go ZK sync was first my my uh answer would be and does it matter I mean they were three or four days apart like right we're getting uh ZK EVMS every week now uh I think we're okay uh you know that probably won't matter in the grand scheme of things David let's do some takes of the week you ready we'll start with yours oh man this is okay this is the take that triggered a bunch of fighting out there so um so sometimes well actually it was just one and another one uh sometimes this is my take sometimes I feel bankless us that's us Ryan uh should Victory lap more often we ignored Solana Avalanche and Tara during the bull market in which we got our not friendly label as blind East Maxis the thing that happened next was Solana went down 80 versus ether Avalanche went down 70 versus ether Luna is basically at zero more or less for all the same reasons that they would be uh that this is unsustainable uh this is just like the in what's in Vogue at the moment and we chose to not cave to external pressure and not cover something that we didn't really understand or believe in and then meanwhile we focus on layer twos and so our listeners disproportionately got the op and arbitrum airdrops compared to other media organizations because that's what we chose to focus on and we also pounded the table about cross layer 1 Bridge risk so I can't take credit for of course all of this stuff but I'm saying that our listeners leaned in towards layer twos more than alt layer ones and also leaned into shied away from Cross layer one Bridge risk and so we've got a lot of in the second half of 2021 because that was not invoke layer twos were not cool and during that time you know what was cool or alt layer once and you and I had conversations many times like dude are we out of touch like with what's going on um and perhaps in that moment maybe we were but this is when we decided that bankless is making content for things that you and I believe in not what other people want us to believe and so that that choice I think has been to the great benefit of our listeners so far and all the choices that we've made about bankless and the things we choose to talk about and how we talk about them I would make again immediately bankless is not perfect but neither is this industry and I think if you can scroll down because I don't have my own treatment uh I only hope that we can continue this track record and that was my take of the week yeah uh I I agree with that you know and you know I gotta I gotta play the the role of making sure that we inject some humility into this too 100 definitely doesn't mean that we're perfect um and maybe it's the Canadian in me David but like uh I have a hard time like tweeting a Victory lap type tweet so I'm glad you do that on behalf of bankless because if we don't do your breaks who else is going to but um I I will say um we're definitely not perfect but uh I I hope the listeners know that what you hear on Bank list is um authentically what we actually believe and we try to stay as curious and open-minded uh as possible we're also also not perfect at that we also have our biases but I'm actually not against like I I think um I think you want somebody in crypto to have biases right they just have to be biased towards um the right things like whenever possible we try to be biased towards bankless Technologies and towards decentralization and towards things and products we think are making the world better and are in it for the long-term game so um I appreciate bias as long as it's not like it's long-term oriented bias and we we do try to maintain that here um so we appreciate like everyone kind of holding us accountable for these values I do think at times we've been um maligned a little harshly um but uh yeah we're gonna keep bringing this this platform to you guys and uh you'll always know that when you come to bank list this is what David and I authentically think whether it's right or wrong and maybe we'll be a little stubborn on some of our convictions I think that's uh reinforced that a little in US finding the balance of conviction and yet being open-minded is probably the sweet spot for all investors last thing I'll say on this is do not expect bankless to be journalists don't use the we are not journalists we talk about we talk about news but we have we are and always have been crypto investors that are on the journey going bankless and we're just sharing what we're learning here so um yeah maybe to turn that into uh what banklist is kind of Taken and message and we also attempt to where our biases on our sleeves like it's not like we're hiding them and like shoving them in the closet like I think we're pretty open and transparent about how we're biased and I also followed up this tweet with one small uh more another follow-on tweet saying I'll be much happier to talk about Solana and Avalanche rip Luna next bull market after they've completed a full stress test cycle uh meanwhile gearing up for another round of thrown at us during next year's next crops uh next Cycles crop up new layer ones with a community brand new people new to the space it does happen every cycle doesn't it yeah um David this is a David Friedberg tweet cash is now a risk asset is a pretty big Paradigm Shift cash being a risk asset is a big Paradigm Shift what's he saying here uh basically I'm this is uh talking about the bank insolvencies right so if you hold your money in a bank and that bank is at risk of going and solving your cash is now at risk the other thing you could do is hold United States treasuries but like that's also at risk and so like nowhere is safe in your dollars uh Dave David Friedberg is a uh co-host of the all-in podcast for those that did not know that uh right right okay here's the consultant of science if you listen to it I uh I also had to take on risk I was thinking about risk this week and because there's something I was you know confused with when they teach you sort of portfolio Theory and you go to kind of Finance classes uh in your undergraduate or in business school they always talk about this term called volatility and the finance textbooks seem to equate volatility with risk like they're one and the same if if an asset or portfolio is volatile that also means it's risky I gotta say David I is just an investor like practically um have found that that is not true at all and I think particularly when you look at um like crypto this is an asset that is very volatile but surprisingly low risk and I don't mean all crypto by the way because there are some very risky crypto assets but I'm in particular I'm talking about something like Bitcoin or ether and so I tweeted this I consider eth a volatile asset I do not consider it particularly risky people often mistake volatility and risk another way to say that may be is some Ethan Bitcoin feel more risky than they actually are it's for me because they can go down eighty percent like 85 relative to the dollar that means they're volatile but if you held did you actually lose anything and so going back to this um this tweet from David Friedberg cash is now a risk asset right for me treasuries are much more risky than Eve like I'm at risk in the real way of it being risked not volatility yes uh this is uh fiscantes who who tweeted I think clarified the point that I'm making volatility becomes risk when one you use leverage that's how volatility can increase risk or two your time Horizon is short or unpredictable that's totally how volatility becomes risk but volatility and risk are not the same thing and people I think uh look at crypto as NASA class and confuse those two um the other thing is number three is uh what I would add to fiskanti's tweet here is if you cannot stomach volatility that also increases your risk if you have like a visceral emotional reaction to seeing your crypto portfolio appreciate 5x and then go down 85 percent or if you don't have convictions another way to say this you definitely increase the risk that you are going to hit the sell button it becomes a much more risky asset so um I don't know if that makes sense to you but like this is by the way um what they teach you in business school they teach you that volatility and risk are one of the same thing and in order to decrease risk you want to you want to decrease volatility but it does nothing to reduce tail risk and it hasn't really that that that Paradigm in the world has not helped me become a better investor in the crypto asset space I think understanding that Paradigm uh early on when I was getting into crypto and everyone was like crypto could go to zero it's super risky but then you understand the fundamentals of crypto it's like it actually cannot go to zero and actually like a buyer steps in somewhere right it kind of can't uh and like all of a sudden like you start to understand and unpack this difference there's one thing about fiscantes a tweet I want to change actually a little bit uh number one if you use leverage I want to change that to your measure of exposure so like say I have a hundred dollars uh if I have one dollar of Bitcoin and 99 uh that volatility of Bitcoin is not a risk yeah if I have 100 of Bitcoin in zero dollars and also I need to pay rent and put food on the table then that volatility does become risk and then you can also get into leverage and you can leverage 100 100 into 100 150 dollars and then that volatility becomes super risky so it actually isn't a binary about whether you are or are not on Leverage it's a function of your exposure to the asset and your short-term needs I think that's a great Point uh and it's totally true and I'd also say that might come packaged in with the term leverage because in a way what you're sort of doing is you're leveraging your future ability to pay rent sure when you like Risk too much in crypto right I guess it's a form of Leverage but yeah the point is uh completely valid all right gotta ask you the question what do you bullish on this week David okay so this is a different one this week uh this is the permissionless 2023 Twitter account which it's its job is to promote the 20 promotions 2023 conference which I'm a huge fan of I'd love promoting it it is also Ryan the best meme account in crypto Twitter that I have been able to find it is extremely obvious that a Zoomer runs this account and they are making some memes that I have never seen before and they are hilarious new territory new friends new territory and so like it's super Zoomer and I I chuckle at every single one also there's a healthy amount of SpongeBob memes which I'm a big fan of uh but this is awesome dude even the least funny memes here are better than most people's memes is like I'm just bullish on the memes and jokes that are coming out of this out of this account like I will say it's uh I haven't seen this Twitter account do much else other than one promote permissionless and to make memes about permissions and I'm sorry I'm this is just product Market fit I just love it I just think it's so funny well well David's so excited about the memes which I also am uh you know that the conference is coming up and yeah we're gonna be there I hope the bankless nation is going to be there that's September 11th through 13th in Austin uh thousands of crypto folks there it's uh talking about defy talking about you know nfts talking about crypto regulatory institutional everything it's a fantastic conference and by the way if you are a bankless citizen you get a discount right David 30 which pays for a Year's worth of your bank list membership also ticket prices go up every two weeks I think there's something in the 400 and they go up by a percentage by the way which means it's exponential so if you are now interested in getting permissions to get you would behoove you to go get a ticket earlier and also pick the subscription there you go uh Ryan what are you both Sean I look uh I really enjoyed the Jim Bianco episode as my favorite episode um that we put out this week I think and one thing that he he he said sort of stuck out to me which would be neat to see the beginning of crypto decorate become uncorrelated with the stock market right we have we have increa we have promised the world an alternative Financial system an alternative banking system and if we are just acting like a risk-on asset that is completely correlated with the stock market and it just it's just a magnified version of holding S P 500 that's not the ticket that's not an alternative banking system and so what we're seeing is um you know Bank stocks down crypto up that is a good indicator that we are starting to build on this harder path which is an alternative money system an alternative Financial system that's there for you when the central banks and the banking system fail and and that's really as the existing system as fault lines show more and more as that narrative propagates is that um is that truth propagates crypto should be showing you should be going up right and it's showing or it's too early to call it but showing early signs of actually doing that and uh that that makes me bullish because that means maybe the market is a little bit smarter and that we're not just like a you know Meme like funded meme stock kind of uh Market as that's the way it was acting in the end of 2021 and 2022 this is uh it feels much more real and substantive than ever before so that's what's making me bullish yeah um I think not only uh that as in like crypto now can express itself independently from the stock market but the other big takeaway I had with Jim Bianco is that uh the economy the health of the economy is is now being expressed in the stock market which also has not been true for a very long time and so the fact that those were Divergent is not a sign of health and the fact that economic strength is now a requirement for the stock market to go up just makes me feel good because that means Main Street and Wall Street are being connected again so another reason to be bullish about the Trad world yeah there you go speaking of uh Jim piaco too he put he puts out some dank memes himself the Bianca research he's giving giving the permissions to kind of run for their money this is uh Janet Yellen what are we looking at here uh so Jim Bianco treats out yelling yelling the banking system is sound and resilient and this is a Photoshop picture of Yellen who's playing the slots at a casino and let me tell you it does not look photoshopped that looks she looks like a lady who could be at in the slot machines she looks like she's having a great time I don't think yeah we also got another second meme and this is a SpongeBob Meme so you know David included it uh the US government says let's kill crypto by any means necessary apart from Total ban and call it operation choke point and then crypto and
