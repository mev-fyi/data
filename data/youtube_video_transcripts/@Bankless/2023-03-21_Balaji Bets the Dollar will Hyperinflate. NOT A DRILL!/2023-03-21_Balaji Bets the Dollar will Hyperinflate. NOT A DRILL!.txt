foreign Boston on he's talking about his prediction that within 90 days the US dollar would hyper inflate and one Bitcoin would be worth one million dollars this is uh both a prediction he made and a bet that he has made after that prediction on Twitter he's been saying some alarming things over the past few days I would say about the U.S banking system and um maybe the most alarming is some of his early predictions have sort of been right there's there's more murmurings of Bank closures that have passed both the United States are now in Europe we just had Credit Suisse But First Republic Bank that just kind of go to zero we have a central bank Communications talking about coordinated efforts between them all to inject liquidity in this market the prospect of like unlimited coverage for all deposits and for all of these underwater assets is now in play too and so I I worry about some of the things coming to pass because his predictions David are quite dire he is sending out an alarm he says the bit signal he says people to get their money outside of the U.S banking system system and into Bitcoin specifically into crypto systems and outside of the areas where the FED has root level access so we brought him on to make this case to hear the evidence for his claims and to see how alarmed we should really be one thing I'll say before uh you get your response in this David is we do intend to bring on a Counterpoint as well so biology has given his case for why we're all basically the US dollar is doomed it's going to hyperinflate and that's going to happen in relatively short period of time we also want to get on somebody to make the opposite claim so that this is balanced and so that listeners can listen to the evidence biology comes up with and listen to the Counterpoint and make their own decision on this but I gotta say we needed to hear him out on this because um he's been right about many things in the past he's been right overall about crypto and kind of the direction and now he's setting off this alarm Bell it certainly um gave me cause for concern and for the reason for this conversation so David what are your thoughts going to this episode what should people keep in mind yeah I think I should the biology is just sounding the alarm that Bitcoin is going to a million dollars he's made that bet and many many people are like uh well he owns a bunch of Bitcoin this is a rational thing for him to do it's a million dollar marketing expense that's not uh what biology is here to say um he is saying the net effect of Bitcoin reaching one million dollars is as a result of the complete destruction perhaps of the United States banking system and the dollar system at large uh his big claim is that you know all of Alameda research and FTX is insolvency where they try to prop up their accounts with uh with some you know finagling of their accounting he is saying that that is perhaps true of the entire banking system where there is just not a there there anymore and so his his idea that Bitcoins won a million dollars is actually a much bigger topic which is more or less the complete and utter destruction of our banking system a few comments on the actual form factor uh podcasting Logistics 6 for this episode uh biology just we've been talking to biology about doing an episode he randomly just hit us up and said all right let's do this right now uh and so we kind of aped into this interview uh Balaji gave us a ton of links to share and we are doing our best to share them in uh Riverside which is our podcasting recording software recording this one was logistically challenging like I said Ryan said I'm also in the Dominican Republic my internet is an issue but I think the message will become loud and clear and really going back to the content I think the takeaway for bankless listeners regardless of how true apology is I think there's a spectrum here either biology is like 100 right or he's only five percent right but either way the patterns and things that unfold over the next perhaps 90 days of time as a result to banking crises and inflation and liquidity at least I think biology is giving us a mental model a map to test what events happen in one week one month three months and we can test them against biology's thesis and his theories and what he's presented here today so I think that's really the call to action for bankless listeners to understand is see what see the model that biology is putting forth and as more announcements happen as more press bank failures happen or doesn't happen you'll be able to test it against what biology is presented here today yeah absolutely and uh I don't think David you and I are in a place to say that he's right or he's wrong but certainly his argument warrants consideration so that's why we are putting this in front of you today guys we're going to get right to the episode with Biology but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this

made last week biology welcome back to bankless hey welcome thanks uh or I guess uh thank you you're supposed to say welcome thank you so well I'm supposed to yeah yeah you've got your own podcast now by the way which is uh fantastic so um you've probably been playing the the role of host more often so um yeah tell folks about that before we get in it's funny because you know I launched a a Blog right before kovid and it launched a podcast right before this so it's a little bit of deja vu you know where it was just like a month into kind of this new sort of content project and then things started getting intense on the internet um or not just an internet but like the world yeah the podcast is called the network State podcast it is about um what sort of comes after the the 20th century order you know and um I actually think that there's you know the book the networkstate.com uh there's a bunch of stuff in there which I think will potentially be actually fairly relevant to what's going to transpire and I kind of thought it might you know play out over a decade or something like that you know like that saying by you're saying by Lenin there's a uh there's decades where nothing happens and there's weeks where decades happen right like during Corona at the beginning of Corona the um remote work went like 30 40 50 points vertical it did like a decade of adoption in like a few weeks all these kinds of things went like vertical or horizontal or you know down you know right you're here because I think this is you're claiming this is one of those two weeks where our decades happen uh and all of a sudden uh you have been inundated with intention about this crazy crazy bet that you've made where you think that Bitcoin our beloved asset is going to become worth one million dollars inside of the next 90 days which uh when you take that take into account people will call that a bold call uh and so this is made the internet uh all pivot their attention to this claim which is a crazy crazy claim that I think people aren't aren't totally understanding or willing to accept so subology maybe you can kind of walk us through your thought process here like well how is Bitcoin going to become worth a million dollars in the next three months so here's the thing is I don't think I've ever made a price prediction or something like that just not what I do I'm not a price guy I'm not a chart guy um that's you know if you look okay I've I've been in the foreign for 10 years you know I have tens of thousands of tweets I have hundreds of pages of writing whatever hours of podcasts including some someone with you guys right essays and so on and so forth and there's enough context there where people I think you know know that I'm not like a I'm not a Money Motivated person I'm an ideological person in our talks you know and so on I've never been like oh price blah blah let me just back up for a second okay 10 days it should go 10 12 days ago um Silicon Valley Bank uh and silvergate and then Silicon Valley Bank like basically just collapsed overnight there's no warning right just boom done and then this gigantic you know this 200 billion dollar Bank was 40 000 tech companies people who have done basically nothing you know they're just going about their business suddenly found that they're checking accounts the money was gone right like and and then they were being blamed as if you know uh wanting their checking account back was like a bailout or something like that as if they had done something risky and this is this whole frantic kind of thing over the weekend and some people were acting tactically and they were trying to figure out you know how to how to like you know fix the situation or whatever um but I was like how could this possibly have happened you know you know and I started like looking at all of the numbers that I could find online and just to summarize what I found and I'll show you a zillion references on this because it's actually kind of crazy um the Central Bank meaning the Fed the banks and the bank Regulators have all known for at least the past year that hundreds of banks in the US are insolvent meaning Uncle Sam bankman freed they don't have assets on hand on a mark to Market basis to match their liabilities you know Uncle Sam Baker and freed is the best way of understanding this because Sam bakeman freed whether he lied to himself or he lied to others or whatever complicated thing remember he had this balance sheet that was this crazy balance sheet which you know like in his head it added up to more than what people were asking for you know their money out right and until the stress test actually came and people actually withdrew their money neither he nor they knew how much money he actually had because he wasn't just holding it on like a one-for-one basis he was doing these crazy conversions exposing everybody to Market risk and so on and so forth right essentially he took people's trust he took their deposits he invested them in these you know coins and they you know or spent it on something whatever the heck he did marked it as if it was still there and um and then but when they actually came for it there was a huge hole right we now know that story okay that is basically what has happened and the funny thing is you know amjad Massad and I in the uh in the fall of 20 uh 22. we were like you know that's kind of what Fiat banking is also because of fractional reserve and so on if everybody actually asked for their money at the same time they wouldn't be able to get it back but the situation we've got now is so much worse than even fractional Reserve and what that is is that um the banks all did something very much like Sam bingman freed they took your deposits and they bought long-dated treasuries and other long-dated government bonds in 2021 essentially on the guidance of the federal government and or especially the FED really that they were going to keep interest rates low for a long time and then the FED raised rates in 2022 in this sort of surprise super high hike crushed the portfolios of every single um entity that had trusted them and uh and stuck to Banks for this giant surprise of this massive devaluation of bonds uh and you can see and I found all these links where the the bankers are basically panicking about this over 2022 enjoy what they come up with they basically come up with an accounting trick okay called hide you know hold to maturity I call it height to maturity we're just like Sam Baker and free they book it as having not depreciated oh it's still worth what we paid for it we're good right and this time bomb just grew larger and larger and larger and larger across the entire industry with everybody obviously knowing about it and again whether they were lying to themselves or they're lying to others what they didn't do is they didn't notify you the depositor that the money was gone for not just svb but for like millions of depositors across the country and every bank that has U.S treasuries and long data government bonds this is one of those things you know like it's saying like if you have a problem uh if you owe the bank a million dollars uh you know you have a problem if you're the bank of billion dollars a bank has a problem right if you have one bank failure that's A bank's problem if you have hundreds of bank failures that's a central bank's problem back now for a second what is a proposed action that people should take um get your coins get whatever uh you can into crypto okay uh it's I mean I I recommend Bitcoin at this point it is going to be the Lifeboat for you know for a number of different reasons of course if you have other cryptocurrency whatever you know obviously you guys are ethereum guys I'm not you know let's just say that all of the crypto tribalism is going to rise to like a ideological level that we've never seen in a in a year or two years or whatever this crisis over but in this crisis there'll be three kinds of zones Fiat only zones um where like you know crypto is banned or seized and only the government can have it um because it's used to back the currency Bitcoin only zones like maximalist zones and then like you know crypto free zones where you can use whatever cryptocurrency you want okay um and one of the reasons is a lot of Fiat banks are about to die they all trusted the FED at the same time the centralization at the FED buying the same asset at the same time getting it devalued by the same vendor namely the FED in the same way then all going bust at once um that's basically what's happening so biology I just want to put kind of the timeline together and ask how you have been piecing this together right so we had silver uh Silver Gate bank and Silicon Valley Bank that that happens um the weekend of the 11th and 12th let's call it right you put up the bit signal on March 16th so that was Thursday after that weekend and the bit signal is basically like um you telling people that uh Bitcoin was going to go up you said this how do you ring the fire alarm on the internet how do you show it's not a false alarm I'm putting up the bit signal one million dollars in Bitcoin to alert us to the stealth financial crisis thousand dollars per tweet for the best one thousand reply with your charts graph stats and memes so you're clearly propagating a message one question I have for you is to some of the doubters maybe like let's just uh address this at the beginning so this is previous to the bet so some of the people are saying some people are saying biology that this tweet and also the BET itself is kind of like um motion it's basically advertising for your bags which are crypto Centric bags uh how do you respond to that critique the thing is if I didn't hold crypto they would say oh you don't actually have skin the game you're just doing it for attention and so on and so forth right all I can say on that is whole dollars in okay if you don't believe me whole dollars and then see what happens right if you don't believe me buy buy short dated treasuries like three months and just say biology is crazy and you know whatever fine go ahead um but this is like if you look at the full context of everything I've said um it's improv impossible to prove quote motivation or whatever okay but if you look at all the tweets and everything I've ever said um this is something where this is like the crisis that Bitcoin was built for like Bitcoin was born out of Crisis the 2008 crisis and this is the 2023 banking crisis and I remember apology that uh you were very very early to the covet crisis uh and so I remember you were sounding the covet alarm in January February and then coveted hit in March and so you have a track record of doing this and all at least once before that I can remember uh and it being contrarian at the time uh and while this is very different from kovid uh I will have to say that you do have a good you have one very strong Mark of sounding an alarm in a prior crisis at least a couple months ahead of time so this is not this is not a new activity for you yeah it's not it's not fun it's not fun right because everybody thinks you're crazy or you're doing it for attention because essentially both the virus well first let me talk about covert for a second let me come back to that people are saying it was a paranoid conspiracy theory to say that coronavirus would ever spread out of China obviously you're a racist blah blah blah but obviously Public Health people have been thinking about pandemics for a while and at the time um that was a good way of sort of framing that this was not like a threat that a crazy person was coming up with but that public health people were and I had sort of a mental model of the world right like imagine there's like a bunch of rubber bands between countries like Taiwan China right or India Pakistan or Bitcoin ethereum right there's there's these various rubber bands between groups right stress tensions and so on and then we have like a shock to the system where someone goes from zero to one or one to zero a lot of those you know rubber bands update and the system moves into a new confirmation okay and so that's kind of how I was thinking about this like I had like you know this sort of chess board in my head and I was like okay if this hits how does that move this this this this this this and this right do you see what I'm saying okay and by the way for for listeners this was uh a January 30th 2020 tweet timestamp is what we're talking about so well before the general us six weeks became aware six weeks or so and and I'll show you how you can if you just scroll down a little bit you'll see how I did it right um so first is I've been following I was following the raw data I had some background in in you know I like I I before I got into crypto I was actually uh you know basically doing computational genomics and statistics and especially microbial genomics right so I had some background in the space so I had some lenses with which I could read some of the technical literature viruses are exponential and and the thing about this at the time by the way it's funny it's like you know total confirmed cases outside was like less than a thousand or whatever right Sharon's like look it's so low I'm like yeah you know but is it like somebody knows viruses knows Tech it's about like rate of growth you know and this is like a pretty high rate of growth um and the thing about this by the way one thing I'll just back up for a second and say as of January 2023 three years later people believe two things about covid first a novel virus out of China infected more than 700 million people worldwide killing about one percent of them and seriously sickening another tens of millions of people causing significant upheaval by all kinds of governments and a huge Tech shock right on the other hand they also think yeah it wasn't that big a deal life went on both of those things I would say the combination of both those two facts is actually what I'd say the conventional wisdom is as of January 2023 would you agree with that yeah roughly but the thing about that is um while I agree life went on and it certainly it wasn't like the end of life on Earth or anything and we're lucky that it wasn't like the Spanish flu or something um that was certainly not like if you had said if I'd said in January 700 million people will get infected seven million will die um but Life Will Go On nobody would that would be in the weirdest projection ever okay it would sound terrifying and Preposterous but then also and this is important the concert of normality of some kind being restored on the other side would have also seen Preposterous that that is a very non-obvious frame of mind which is a frame of mind I'm in kind of now okay we're basically in and I'll get into details we're basically in the Fiat crisis okay we're in the crisis where like all the centralization of Fiat all the opacity of Fiat all of the you know all the things that Satoshi talked about all of that is now blowing up on people in a very tangible way and really it's um it's kind of remarkable and so now the the thing is we're gonna have a wrenching transition to the crypto economy where just like remote work kind of went like vertical because people just had to right a lot of Fiat systems are going to break uh potentially over the next weeks and months and maybe years and uh we're gonna have to switch over to crypto systems and it'll be a big pain a huge pain of which the single most important is a transition to bitcoin as a global Reserve currency but um but there will be normality of some kind on the other side so biology what one difference between kind of the fire alarm you pulled around covet and the fire alarm the the Fiat crisis fire alarm that you're pulling now is you are actually talking about numbers in a timeline right so you've got 90 days as a number you've got a um a prediction or a bet now as it's turned into of one million dollars in Bitcoin and that is a fairly short duration um timeline so you must think that this is going to happen like um all at once using that that phraseology so suddenly now this is the all at once moment and I'm wondering why you think that like why I mean this is almost like hyper bitcoinization or um the inflation away of all Fiat is sort of a long-term crypto prediction anyway right that's what happens to Fiat over 70 to 100 Year time periods when you know nation states go on the decline in a new monetary policy regime and but you're saying this this is going to happen in 90 days this is going to happen in fast motion and by the way it's happening now and here's your Tweet warning about it so can you tell us why like why why do you feel confident enough to put numbers around this in timelines so you know the exact state of the world in 90 days I don't know but I think it's going to be quite different than today and the main thing I wanted to get people's see it's this is not really a bet on the price of Bitcoin it's a bet on the devaluation of the dollar this is The Honky Cruise hyperinflation table first of all hyperinflation is much more common than people think and second when it happens it's much more rapid than people think people basically lose faith in a currency and they go to a competing Reserve currency okay now historically that has been something where they escaped their local currency for the US dollar but until now you see the big difference versus 2008 is today the US dollar is no longer too big to fail there are two competitors to the dollar there's a renmin b and there's Bitcoin and as I'll get to what what is currently happening is all you know how people have said that the us is going to monetize the debt you've probably heard that before right yeah so everybody knew it was going to happen but not exactly how and it's happening now when I was digging into the SUV situation I was trying to be like how could a 200 billion dollar Bank be insolvent take a look at this graph this is not my graph this is from FDIC this is unrealized gains losses on securities do you see the 2008-2009 over on the left hand side okay and now look at the yawning losses that are there in 2022 okay right this I mean this looks like uh similar to I guess the same bag but freed FTX analogy of like you have a balance sheet with a lot of trash on it and you have a market downturn and they've all lost like 80 to 90 percent of their value and now what's propping up your assets that's sort of what this graph looks like to me and this is across not just one bank it's all the mix one way of thinking about it is you know sometimes people are in debt and then there's a balloon payment at the end and then they're done they just can't pay it right they just don't have the money this is this is kind of like that that's like you know the one of the things that the FI the financial system is set up to be opaque right it's set up to like in 2008 you know if if the market choice is happening on Twitter people would say tell me you don't know what a CDO is without telling me you don't know what a CDO is the whole point is that nobody knows what a CDO is including the guy who's selling it and the guy who's buying it they've all fooled themselves and thinking they're so smart and actually the thing underlying is a house that sucks because nobody's paying the mortgage and no amount of financial engineering can can do anything other than hide that eventual Mark to Market on the thing with the guys paying zero money you see what I'm saying right and in the same way what's happened today is uh all of this financial engineering has led to a house of cards um where the act the money is gone right under underneath it like the the banks literally don't have if you came to them this gigantic hole on the right hand side if people came to them and actually asked for their dollars out the banks would not be able to liquidate their assets to get their dollars out okay and so for the whole year they hid this you know with the right decoder lens from where we are now three four months later you can see huh wait it's not one bank it's not svb it's a lot of banks right and but look at the thing at the end right it's like uh you know 423 billion during the first six months a year grew larger right this time bomb was growing and the bank Regulators were aware of it and they weren't notifying you the depositors they were just thinking they could Kick the Can again somehow we all know as part of a fractional Reserve System if there is a run on the bank there's not enough dollars in the bank account to meet the demands of that run on the bank but this is somehow worse because we have these Securities propping up the assets of the bank and of depositors uh funds that have just lost massive amounts of of value and so if you mark them to Market we are much further underwater than just the the typical fractional Reserve banking system you know one of the things I learned in kind of tweeting about this is just like bankman freed had these weird self-deception tricks or taboos or whatever within the company that stop people from asking the right questions all of these bankers um basically do not think of the FED as an actor right and so they think of them as a referee and um so first let me explain what the reality of the situation is and then let me explain what they think it is and why they're they haven't told you about it the reality of the situation is um while it's complicated the Federal Reserve effectively gave guidance to Banks to buy certain assets that it then massively depreciated all at once and crushed every single bank that trusted the fed their Bank their balance sheets all at once and that's responsible for this huge devaluation here um and uh the the thing is though that like a lot of Finance guys they think that it's like weird to blame the Fed okay why do you think it's weird to play with that they think of the FED as like a referee you know how people used to say oh you can't blame the media if you're a bad guy the media will call you out you should be ashamed like as in a referee as in neutral kind of an arbitrary of of laws yes as a neutral right just like people used to think the media was like a neutral referee of just like the political system or whatever it just calls balls and Strikes we have you know we don't have any opinions on anything right I mean that's ludicrous today right um you know they're constantly attacking people um people thought that the the Fed was like a a neutral referee of the system and it just like deliberation to figure out what the right rate to set is and Beyond politics and so on and so forth right if you're a fund manager you simultaneously think okay the FED is all important Powell is more powerful than the president uh you know we listen to everything the FED says our algorithms trigger on their every word oh they're so so important but then if somebody says oh this bank got decimated because the FED hydrates they'll say LOL what a loser you know look you can't take everything the FED says it's their word it's your responsibility to hedge um you know it's not the feds you know the FED just puts out guidance uh you you know you just got to make your own book and so on and so forth okay now but think about that right that's two different things it's first the FED is all powerful and second the FED is never to be held responsible Tim Tang okay and the reason that if you are a fund manager um you can't control the fed you just have to react to it so it's almost as if they're like setting the laws of the video game that you're playing and so you can't be a wimp you just have to win within the laws of the video game do you see what I'm saying okay and people are like you know what yeah maybe once in a while they'll complain about a call by the ref but fundamentally they think the FED as legitimate how could they think any other way you know what you're not going to have somebody setting interest rates well that would mean we can't help people we can't have full employment that would be terrible right or you're saying we should they should just publish an interest rate and stick to it no no they need to have a data dependent policy path where they go and assimilate all the information from the world on the State of Affairs and they update the interest rate but that's like by the way and this is like a really fundamental root and Branch critique imagine steering a car by mail okay you've got your car all right you drop a postcard out the window okay you wait like uh you know a week for it to come back and then you turn left or right what's going to happen you're going to crash right because the time constant of steering is seconds and this is like weeks right that's like what the FED is where it's getting in data that's just lagging data oh inflation's up that's a that's a result of so many millions of people doing all these things okay now let's change interest rates or whatever and they're changing like a single parameter okay and it's a highly political process so tldr is a lot of this stuff is actually intentionally meant to be complicated but the simple version is the Fed bankrupted the banks okay it bankrupt its own banks at your end 2021 only four Community Banks had tangible Equity Capital ratios below five percent that number increased to 333 at June 30th 2022 indicating less ability to sustain economic shocks okay there's some Finance bro language there can you help us parse through what that actually means yeah it basically means um there are 333 Banks where the money is gone and so I I want to take a moment and like summarize everything here and everything yeah the reason why you're saying uh Uncle Sam bankman freed is that okay so FTX uh insolvent did some funny accounting tricks to maintain uh pseudosolvency public solvency and basically biology you're saying that that is now true for the entire bank and Commercial banking system of the United States of America and even more than that because it's also true for all of these foreign Banks it's even bigger than that every foreign bank that bought U.S treasuries and by the way when I was saying this people are like ah biology you're so crazy blah blah blah but did you see what they just did with the swap lines okay look at this so what are we looking at here breaking market news from the U.S federal reserve this says the fed and the central banks of the U.S uh sorry the United Kingdom Canada Japan and European Central Bank and Switzerland announced a coordinated action to improve liquidity provision through the standing US dollar liquidity swap lines doing that on the weekend it seems like the central Bankers always do like really important things on the weekend like when they're they're in crisis mode and I guess that happened on a Sunday Sunday the 19th yeah so what does this mean what is this these words around um improve liquidity provision through standing US Dollars exact liquidity swap lines what is that again the thing I want to I want to stress over and over again is they will mock you and attack you for not knowing every piece of their lingo because it's like it's what camouflage is to like a venomous sneak okay the whole point is to sneak up on you bite you okay and and when we think about by the camouflage event stick it's a good analogy because the snake didn't design its camouflage it was just evolutionary okay the finance guys because the thing is see in in our sector of the world if you're investing if you're doing at least like in a tech sector if you're putting money into companies it's called primary investment and they're going and building a product and selling it right that's that's something where both parties all parties can win the customer the company the investor and so on okay Finance it was a fundamentally zero-sum World often where one party is going to lose okay and say have evolved a bunch of camouflage tricks to hide what they're doing from themselves and from others and the whole point I mean there's a saying in finance how are you going to screw me right everything is hidden in the fine print and then it's like ah you signed that but you didn't think of that you know the whole point is it's like adversarial all right and and just to show you how like insane that gets all right um you know one of the things I um I found that the whole you know how people are like oh uh you know you Tech guys you should have known that the bank was insolvent it was in a public statement and so on so I remember how they're saying stuff like that right well um it is something where the insolvency was intentionally hidden in a footnote evidence of deception okay now by the way it wasn't just svb that was deceiving what happened was the FED surprised the banks okay by giving them a bunch of assets and then or selling a bunch of assets they then surprised you valued the panicking Banks then decided to surprise the depositors by hiding their gigantic unrealized losses and that is the time bomb that is about to blow up the entire fed centered economy okay they're blanking out the stuff that they used to show to show their giant losses and they just buried it in a footnote okay the fact that they were insolvable what are we looking at here this is a svb document this is svb's financial okay so so the point is look you know the EU makes every company put some stupid cookie disclosure on their website but the regulator is allowing a 200 billion dollar Bank to bury its insolvency in a footnote okay and let me explain that's what I mean by like a poisonous snakes camouflage right the thing is you paid for you know with your tax and so and you paid for Regulators to give you a high trust banking system what the hell are you paying The Regulators for if they are literally covering up the insolvency of the bank we're talking about something where 40 000 companies and all of their employees were banking at an insolvent bank and not notified about it by the regulator that they were paying to protect them you see what I'm saying what are you alleging is the incentive here apology says yeah like like the poisonous snake has an incentive either you know defense or attack or something like this what is the incentive of central banks and and Regulators why would they want to to hide this within the system exactly well so here's the thing if the entire system is going bust okay and you have been handed a flaming bag of dog poop and which you know the only the defense I can make is while certainly the mismanagement over the last few years has been historical the debts of the US have been building up for a long time so there's always an incentive to Kick the Can okay now the can can't be kicked so they are just trying to hide it for as long as they can suddenly it blew up with svb if all the banks go bust the regulator has a problem so if they're going to go bus the regular needs to find a scapegoat and the scapegoat is either The Tech Guy or the Trump guy or both or the people who are getting their money out or whatever um if it was discovered that the bank Regulators in the central bank had caused a crisis and covered up the crisis would that look good for them no so this chaos that's that's about to unfold essentially what I was able to discover was that the devaluation of the of the dollar the monetization the debt that that dalio talked about whether intentionally or emergently they're doing it now they're not calling it that they're calling it bailouts of banks but this is actually the you know messy devaluation of the dollar where all the debts they couldn't print are printed at once and if they thought that and if they said that because they've got the sleeping bag of dog poop how do they stick it with somebody without getting blamed right if they just came up front and said we're not going to be able to make our bond payments the US's can't pay its debts therefore we're just going to print Monopoly money we and your purchasing power goes away right then there would be attention on what they were doing and by the way this is just the most extreme version of something that's always happened okay where um often Regulators cause a problem and then uh you know they it blows up in public and then what happens is more failure more funding okay like every crisis Powers them up because um let's say for example there's some drug company and it's got an issue right the bad drug drug company goes to zero FDA is brought in and they're spanked in Congress oh you did such a bad job and you know what it ends with okay how much budget do you need to make sure this doesn't happen again even even failure mode is success in that more failure more funding because people can't conceive an alternative to FDA so it's failures every you know it's it has an incentive to either cause or turn something into a crisis because then it's a big deal right and and again this is something where is it conscious sometimes it's like Oh They'll exaggerate and they'll say oh you crypto guys are criminals like what genzler is doing that's conscious right he's making you guys out to be criminal so he can get more budget and Power um you know but sometimes it's like just the you know the emergent incentives where it's like oh if this thing blows up well we get more budget and you know like uh well I guess now we have the authority to go and regulate that thing that we screwed up and the way of thinking about it that's outside the FDA or outside the FED is do you have an alternate regulator right don't you want a regulator which will tell you in a trustworthy way that your deposits are still there right that's a blockchain apology before we get to kind of blockchain because some of this has happened so fast for people right so like I was just saying like it was a week and a half ago and we first started seeing like Silver Gate uh go under and then the crisis with a Silicon Valley bank and then just last weekend so not not the previous weekend but one before it seemed like you know the the fed the US government FDIC came out and said look all depositors funds are going to be made whole we're going to basically implicitly we're going to stop the banking crisis here no more Bank runs and then last week we started to see oh okay well maybe this is spread to Europe and Credit Suisse but it's just one bank right and it's like you hear rumors and you hear Rumblings and you hear all of these things and I think at every stage the general public is like okay well I don't understand finance and I I'm not surprised that Bankers did Banker things and there's a few Rogue actor Bankers here and Banks and the FED is taking care of that FDIC is taking care of that this is not going to spread any further I think that's the the the feeling the general feeling of of the public right now why do you think this is more severe why do you think they can't just just issue and say oh depositors funds are going to be secured FDIC will cover them don't worry so let me show you something ready yeah put this up on screen Jean-Claude junker when it becomes serious you have to lie you know who this guy is I've never heard that name former head of the Eurozone okay this is Central Banker what he's basically saying is when the system is actually melting down you have to give public statements saying everything's all right while you frantically you know what this is equivalent of okay remember uh FTX is fine assets are fine right yes like that is literally what is happening now the series the fact that the Federal Reserve has put out multiple statements over the last few weeks that are like um we're still solvent it's still there you know Etc like everything is on fire and we're all going to die it's a closer translation of that I mean so the whole point is for them to spend whatever trust they have and hope you don't exit the system so March 12 2023 they said 20 we're only going to print 25 billion it won't be necessary to draw on the funds in four days it was up to two trillion and really it's going to be Infinity okay so I mean it's funny but it's also bananas right so this is a new era okay this is the final era where they have found they can't hike rates anymore they are going to they all people are looking for their money in the banks and so rather than those people coming up with oh my God the money is gone they're printing tons of money to give it to these Banks and if and the banks are taking it uh and if you look at um the way they're doing it is this is swap lines and the btfp program and Arthur Hayes has some good if you want to know all the technical details of exactly how they're doing this Arthur Hayes is the 150 IQ guy who can talk to you about it okay as I said it's set up to be complicated and whatnot and like oh no they're not actually printing money haha you're so naive but you know the 50 IQ 100 IQ 150 IQ guy right basically gigantic amounts of new money is rushing in to uh because they believe there's going to be a ton of Bank runs right um and the reason is those those bonds that they had in their portfolios that were marked down um well the FED said you know what we're going to give you money that will make them seem as if they're worth what they were worth so if you lost 15 cents a dollar we're gonna pretend that's like 100 cents on the dollar it's just like the market Treasures they bond these bought these assets at par right and again it's all this obfuscation to cover for the fact that basically what dalio talked about the giant print that monetizes the debt the digital devaluation the dollar is here this is like the final banking crisis so biology here here's the part that I think some people don't understand though is like so if the fed intervenes and provides all of this confidence to the market and they they play the act and they seem super confident there's no problem here of course all of the assets are backed this is the the US banking system they're always backed in a very serious tone and the market actually buys that it might be a self-fulfilling prophecy in that stops the bank run now one thing I I read in Arthur Hayes article though is that that won't stop the Arbitrage opportunity of things like like money markets where if you have deposits in a bank and you're only receiving like you know a fraction of a percent of Interest you're going to want to go chase the higher interest payment on your dollar somewhere else and so you there might be a bleed out of the banking system into like money market ETFs and depositors aren't stupid over the long run and of course they're not going to let the bank essentially make money on them and so they're going to withdraw it where's the withdrawal coming from I suppose if there's the confidence is still there what they are counting on is amidst all this chaos that you wire money from One bank to another you wire money to all the big Banks only if you turn into Bitcoin are you outside the system what's happening is all of the small Banks all the tech Banks all the think different banks are getting wrecked and the big guys are coming in as saviors with printed money from the fed and ability from the FED to just scoop up all the small Banks and the end state is in a panic people are like let me wire money to the saviors thank you government right which is both arsonist and firefighter okay so they set all these small banks on fire by destroying all of their balance sheets by giving them this directive to buy these bonds that they devalued again whether intentional or emergent Behavior doesn't actually matter you can describe it as if it was intentional even if it's a merchant you know like an ant colony every individual ant isn't like you know sketching out a blueprint but they're responding to local incentives okay so the the net effect of this right now without the bit signal is all these small Banks go to zero your bank goes to zero and uh you in a panic wire your money to a big Bank and that's a trap now you're like I'm I'm with the federal government now I'm in the too big to fail bang woo Christ is so over thank you fed the fed's a hero they save the day right and now you're in some like you know five percent you know money market thing or or you're you've locked it up in treasuries or you're locked up just in a big bank and here's the thing now at the end when all the small banks are dead all the Community Banks are dead all of the tech banks are dead all of the crypto banks are dead okay and you've got only the big banks at the end of the banking crisis do you know the other thing that they chose to kind of like You know despite all of this uh you know it's a very busy time for the Federal Reserve but they managed to get out this press release did you see this this is a press release saying Federal press uh Federal Reserve announces July launch for the FED now service right which is their uh yeah that's their cbdc so again I'm not saying I don't know exactly it's very hard to say how intentional versus how emergent it is but the plan if you're described as a plan looks something like this um the the USS debtsa can't pay uh saddle all of the banks with these giant um you know these these giant unpaid like uh these giant liabilities have tons of them go bust come in swooping as a hero printing the money so people are like thank you fed you got me my money back and then also have them all centralized at the big banks in the process and then amidst all the chaos you've got like four banks in the US and like One Bank in Canada or whatever the number is in each place and now you just roll out of cbdc and now the banks that were too big to fail are too big to escape okay because they won't allow interconvertibility into crypto and all the crazy China style tracking can be applied moreover everybody's probably going to be much poorer in 90 days after I mean to an extent that might be you know hard to describe okay but like if the the West actually does effectively default on the dollar um and you know all of the stuff which people have thought is worth a billion goes to zero which is happening overnight right you saw you know First Republic like Equity zero like you take a lot of billion dollar hits very fast right A lot of people are much poorer than they thought and that has huge Ripple effects right house payments all kinds of payments don't go through huge Ripple effects of the economy that we're just going to see so in an environment of all the small banks are dead All the Monies have big Banks um people are scared the the cbdc is rolled out and now you're locked in to a China style system of massive centralization and you you know it's too big to escape okay and then they can do those things you know the things they're like incentives like oh spend your money today or lose it have you seen stuff like that sure right all the tracking and so on now again remember the 50 IQ 100 IQ 150 IQ thing if we don't have a lens into all of the actors that set up the bomb like this okay but basically we do know what the exit is amidst all of this chaos with all of these wires flying around all of these Banks you can do something they didn't expect you to do you know what that is yeah you're saying buy crypto buy Bitcoin buy Bitcoin and the reason I say Bitcoin is look obviously you know I like you guys and I like it but if there's one thing you know if you have some relative or you have some you know friend who doesn't know they'll say what kind of Bitcoin should I buy right you know you know they it it just has name recognition in in an emergency people are you're not asking people to do portfolio optimization uh do I think on the other side of this I think Bitcoin is gold and I think ethereum is the financial system I think that's probably right because ethereum can scale but you know lots of transactions but um but I think also there's gonna be jurisdictions that are so tired of finance that they will be like Bitcoin maximalist jurisdictions and they will just not want I mean if everything goes to zero and Bitcoin is the only thing that doesn't go to zero you'll have like a lot of people become essentially overnight converted to bitcoin maximalism and that's why I remember a year or two ago I said Bitcoin maximalism is the most important ideology in the world that nobody knows about do you guys remember saying something like that right like you you guys you're gonna see what I mean okay um because Bitcoin has the advantage of being Rel I mean it's obviously complicated with the cryptography and so on but now it's relatively simple okay and in a time of Crisis people need something simple that they can all rally behind that's why the bit signal that one thing goes vertical everybody in the space values it we get to the Lifeboat okay and the thing about it and here's the important thing the big difference with Bitcoin as opposed to every single other action within the Fiat system is it's the thing that the FED is not directly or indirectly a system administrator over okay who has root see what I'm saying like any any entry in the Bank of Japan If the Fed wants they can get the bank expand to just delete that freeze that account stop it seize it Etc they've got root over this you know like in The Matrix right the guys The Roots administrator they've got root so that entire U.S financial system they have root access any stock they can freeze they did to the truckers you know the Canadian truckers they did to the Russians right any thing where you are on their server and they have root okay they can monkey with it and so from their perspective you know what yeah this is a huge mess with the money flying around and whatnot but at the end of the day it's all just going to end up back at banks that they control and so who cares you know it'll be like a time of chaos but then we'll roll out the FED now and we'll make sure that never happens again we'll have total control over everything okay I don't know exactly what they're thinking but that's a result unless you get to bitcoin so your theory that is that is that is something they don't control apology to walk this through your theory is all of the banks are underwater by a lot and the bankers are lying about it effectively and as Jean-Claude juncker said when it gets very serious you have to lie as a Bankers lied in 2008 and you think that the reason is because people people are forgotten how much they lied and Bank runs are going to uh continue and they're going to be faster than ever because we are in this new digital era and so we've seen you know First Republic svb just like kind of dropped to zero overnight uh and you think that anywhere that someone flees with their money if you go from small Regional Community Bank to larger U.S Bank it doesn't matter because you're still effectively inside of the fed's system you're in their prison and so they're content to let you move from you know some uh small Community Bank to JP Morgan to a money market they don't really care because they have root access on all of these systems and you're saying you're making the case that the dollar as a result of all of this money printing that is happening through this new form of quantitative easing which is not called quantitative easing it's it's something else but during the bank run all of this money gets printed effectively and that sends the Dollar on a hyper inflation kind of track against all Commodities maybe but more specifically Bitcoin because people are going to flee the banking system and they're going to park their assets into the only non-root access fed asset class that we have which is crypto and predominantly Bitcoin because that has kind of the Mind space for this narrative use case anyway is this the the summary of the thesis yes there's one thing I'd add though which is it's pretty good one thing about is I expect wage and price controls and so on so um prices on anything that the FED has like bred or whatever they won't allow the price of bread to go to some crazy level they'll post price controls on it so instead you just get shortages or the price of this is what happened in the Soviet Union the price was low but the good just wasn't there okay so you you know anything that um anything where they can kind of hide the scarcity of it right and blame it on the store or whatever remember they were trying to say oh my God you greedy corporations for raising prices remember they were doing that okay the only signal the one honest signal in the world that they can't fully fake or is is basically the desire to exit from the system that's literally what this is can enough people get to the Bitcoin exit in time before they close the exits so you are predicting exits then to bitcoin yes as Wells because they shut down silvergate they shut down uh you know so silvergate svb First Republic um um gosh what's a signature signature was murdered it wasn't even right so it's like fog of War as Nick Carter talked about right fog of War banks are dying boom kill this one right and uh these some of these Banks died by Bank runs that the FED itself caused some of them were just pulled from licenses but just have it happen all at the same time so it's chaos and people can't figure it out when they're outside okay you know if they're billing out all of the U.S banks all of the foreign Banks who are connected to the Federal Reserve System at the same time um it's it's clearly a banking crisis right hopefully I mean that people are no longer dying that that's a banking crisis and what is the effect of that banking crisis well there's basically two possible outcomes the first is everybody trusts the banks at the end of the day they wire to the banks what's the name of this podcast you know it bankless bankless and the literal nature of that I think is going to actually surprise even us [Laughter] okay because a lot of Fiat banks will either go to zero oral but will become like Venus fly traps and if you are if you put down you you may need some Fiat to pay the bills I recognize that okay because who knows exactly when and how all this stuff comes about all right I totally recognize that but having at least some of your like a good chunk of your net worth whatever that means to you in Bitcoin held locally you will have the strongest technological and social defense on it worldwide they both matter and you know why the social defense matters what do you mean by social defense by the way yeah that's very important so technological defense is encryption right social defense is is your jurisdiction going to allow you to hold Bitcoin right so there was uh in the 1930s an executive order uh 6102 which was effectively a gold ban on U.S citizens private ownership right that's what you mean by you know social uh guarantees the holders of gold were called things like hoarders uh for example that it was just um socially uncooperative and socially unproductive and like evil maybe for people to hoard away and store their wealth to exit the system if you will and to have gold bars around your house um you know we don't have to talk about the the us if if you don't want to but could you imagine this sort of scenario playing out in jurisdictions uh across the world well let's just say this okay in the event so right now what we're on Pace for is before the fire alarm okay before ring the fire alarm we were on Pace for dollar holders becoming bag holders okay a stealth digital dollar devaluation masked as bailouts whether again whether it's intentional or emergent doesn't matter but essentially you would get all this printed money in your fright you'd run to the big Banks you'd wire all the money there you'd be locked in and uh centralized and be this cbdc issued with this currency that was worthless against bread or whatever uh or or the prices were kept low but the bread wasn't there so either it's hyper you know serious inflation or or shortages um and by the way one thing to keep in mind that's a very important thing people are like well come on dude like 2008 it was bad but was the end of the world blah blah right well the thing is people know that uh the American taxpayer bailed out the banks right but what they don't know is actually the world build out America you know why the US exported its inflation okay and so the thing is when you can if you can there's two ways of robbing somebody the first way of robbing them is gun to their face they know they're being robbed and so on okay the second way which is much more effective is silent robbery where you're even telling them you're doing them a favor or something like this Egyptians have tasted the bread of Liberty right people literally set themselves on fire because food prices were so high okay you know who it was the end of the world for all of those previously stable countries in like Libya and Tunisia and so on that were just basically set on fire by inflation okay in the early 2000s the Arab Spring wasn't just some that was just absolute pandemonium and Chaos caused by essentially okay those people get to pay for the financial crisis but it was so complicated and the the it was so indirect that everybody can deny that that's actually what happened okay um because think about how many transactions are it's not on a blockchain you can't look at it you can't prove that that happened exactly in that way you can point at some correlational numbers and so on but you can look at food prices Spike after this printing okay and you can ask okay where did the inflation go it got shunted and before 2008 okay this is the key chart before 2008 Republicans and Democrats are roughly equal okay the real GDP they're roughly matched afterwards what happens somehow all the Democrats become much richer on average than all the Republican districts so Republicans were taxed by inflation to pay for the financial crisis so cancel out effect is who gets a printed money first wins in 2008 the Democrats effectively taxed the Republicans and the foreign dollar holders to um pay for the bailout that's that's fundamentally what happened okay and the foreign dollar holders they got um you know either directly or indirectly they had riots and Chaos in the Arab Spring and the domestic ones were impoverished so it is not that 2008 just was okay it said it was shunted the cost of that was shunted to the invisible does that make sense right basically in a sense the most powerless person is the one without a voice who cannot complain or understand what is happening to them uniswap is the largest on-chain

day and provides a wealth of knowledge and support on your journey West I'll see you in the Discord we're looking at the the visually visualizing the purchasing power of the dollar of the last century so we're looking at a steep decline down from 1917 until 2019. this is silent theft okay it is framed as if it's good for you to take away all of your money because oh a little bit of inflation is good okay and fundamentally by the way this is where Bitcoin rejects this foundational concept that is to say uh the traditional macroeconomics view is yeah hyperinflation is bad but deflation is also bad we wouldn't want prices to go down we want a little mild inflation two percent Target or whatever each year right and whereas the Bitcoin view is hyperinflation is of course a catastrophe but inflation is also just a slow motion catastrophe deflation and even hyper deflation are good if they're caused by technology meaning uh for example with Moore's Law the price of uh transistor I mean it's not exactly this transistor density doubles every every 18 months is right that's a technical difference but let's just say the price of computing you know drops in half every 18 months as a approximate version right that's hyper deflation the cost of something is dropping rapidly and the traditional macro Theory would say when deflation happens people hoard they don't buy because of right except with Hyper deflation of computers even though they keep getting cheaper very fast we buy a lot of them it's a crucial part of the modern world right so the macroeconomic theory that hyper deflation is bad I didn't even think hyper deflation exists by the way but the macroeconomic theory of deflation and hyperdeflation being bad is not actually with the reality the reality is when you use technology to reduce the cost of something that's actually good okay this fundamental thing is that you know one thing about it is American keynesianism is bad just like Soviet economics was bad it's just slightly less bad but we don't realize that it's actually all so bad you see I'm saying it's also fake and what have you it's go ahead it's a lesser lesser of two evils right and and the way that I think that what you're saying Balaji is like the Bitcoin the Bitcoin meme between ethereum and why you're saying like oh I like you guys is because like obviously me and Ryan are known to be uh ethereum leaning but I've always been of the mindset that it's Bitcoin during times of war and ethereum during times of peace and I think the crisis that you are suggesting is that we are in Wartime right now this is this is a crisis moment where uh there there is a a flight and so this is not a time to be thinking about Innovation and layer twos this is a time to be thinking about safety Simplicity redundancy because this is a crisis moment that's exactly right that is exactly right David and you know that's why I tweeted something like look I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist but we are all Bitcoin maximalists down like you know you know in Indian mythology like you know the third eye right like imagine like the third laser eye you know kind of opening you know that's literally what what I'm talking about okay um we are truly in Wartime mode and there's a digital fire burning that not everybody can see it right that's why I put up the fire alarm Okay when I did that people are still watching Tick Tock or whatever if you go back and look at the tweets around that time and now the entire world was talking about wait could the dollar hyperin played against they started to actually you know whether they yelled at me or not okay I before I rang the fire alarm and by the way I did it with a bit signal first before the taking the bet the BET was just got even more people's attention because a very specific kind of thing right bit signal got a lot of attention in its own right the point was not to get attention for its own sake the point was to get attention to get to the Lifeboat because the final digital devaluation the dollar is coming and did I show you the chart of the hyperinflations how how quickly that can happen right and we just went through a bunch of graphs we're like first Republican which went to zero like this right signature to zero they they just shut it down like over a weekend um the the bank printing went to 150 billion dollars you know in in a few days like like over the weekend and David I'm so glad that you get that right that in Wartime Bitcoin because Bitcoin will be protected by enough governments Bitcoin is well understood and that will be a fundamental cleavage in the world which is um it's going to be are they like uh you know atheist monotheist polytheist right you know the concept okay so in in the network State book I have this concept of God State and network okay and you remember we were talking about that you know and and the question is what is your mental model of the world is the most powerful force is it almighty God is it the US military which is you know the state right or the Chinese military or is it encryption right God State Network and then from that you can you can actually have obviously you have combinations of stuff I talk about in the book but from that you could have like an atheist monotheist polytheist so for example on the god Leviathan right atheist doesn't believe in God the monotheist is like Christian Muslim you know Jewish Etc the polytheist is like a Hindu believes in multiple gods right okay now with the state you have the atheist doesn't believe in state they're like an anarchist okay um monotheist monostatist that's like uh an advocate for Empire like a Chinese nationalist or you know like a dollar nationalist that's what's gonna I think Gonna Come um and then um the third is you have um uh you have a poly status like a digital Nomad they hop between states okay and then with coins you have a no coiner okay like Fiat only okay they hate coins okay a monocloner like a maximalist Bitcoin Maximus and then you have a polycoiner which is me in normal times okay but in Wartime um we have to focus all of our energy behind something and it's not a portfolio strategy thing it is uh it's not even and this is very important it's like people just don't get it yet this is not the make money time because everybody's going to be a lot poorer soon unfortunately okay um the actual devaluation of the dollar means the entire party that we lived in where things were all much richer than we think right that's about to come to an end and exactly how much poor we are I don't know but like you know America is a new Argentina is not a bad mental model in my view right Joe do you know how Joe Argentina was or I mean it obviously still exists but the rich country that became poor yeah are the Argentine agricultural uh industry is amazing but then just corruption set in government mismanagement of money at all just it broke an entire what was once a very rich country and it's just hyperinflation and government corruption just broke it all if you're really really really really bad at Capital allocation a rich country will become poor you're saying the time has come where like we kicked the can down the road but then it fell off the cliff uh exactly the Sidewalk Ends Here bankruptcy bankruptcy happens gradually and then suddenly and so now the question is the dollar holder is a bag holder right at the end of the day now the fire alarm has been run it used to it would have been without the fire alarm everybody would have just been hit by this digital Pearl Harbor right right because the whole thing you know like FTX assets are fine don't worry etc etc boom venus fly trap you're done right because you you didn't get your money out in time right so Uncle Sam bakeman freed is saying assets are fine Etc and if you have and by the way it's not just a Dollar by the way it's basically any fiat currency that is controlled by the us or really by China okay because that's the other sector I'll come to China right any fiat currency if you saw that thing where it's like um I mean I'll clarify because I think there are like uh the Saudis or there's there are countries that have Fiat currencies that the US uh does not control okay um India and whatnot those May um those will probably in my view after this crisis eventually be gold or digital gold backed okay so that combination of Gold Plus digital gold gold will be like a state to state thing where you know like States will be able to trade that amongst themselves and it'll be very ritualized and and infrequent okay um but it'll happen but then digital gold will become important and so literally you'll need gold and or digital gold to back your currency it will kind of go back to the 19th century after this Fiat crisis uh and all the stuff that we've talked about kind of in in crypto it'll just like happen very very fast a particularly extreme version of when I talk about like absolutely insane inability to allocate resources is um is this 20 years to build a bathroom they held a ribbon cut an accelerating a press conference and the photo just tells it all that's a California state Senator and a bunch of people there with a press conference cutting a toilet paper to open a single stalled bathroom do you um uh subscribe to the whole fourth turning idea yes I I yeah this is this just kind of feels very forth turning it's very Force turning also the idea of the fourth turning is that there's like these four cycles of generations and they all relate to each other but the gist of it just put it very very reductively is like the whole meme of um Good Times make weak men and weak men make bad times uh and I think the point that you're trying to make with a bunch of just of our our leaders our our government leaders who are me mocking to cut toilet paper with their fingers to announce the launch of a single stall public bathroom is a bunch of uh perhaps weak men who are about to create some bad times because we are misallocating our funds uh and then the downstream net effect of this is that we you know make bad financial Capital allocation choices uh but then we try and cover it up because we are weak men not taking responsibility uh and we can do that for so only so long and this is also highly actually related to Ray dalio's whole entire um uh idea of macro power Cycles and so a lot of this is all kind of like lining up and I definitely see the point uh and this all of this is what you're saying is like you like you said at the beginning this isn't necessarily your bet which is how this whole thing got started your bet that Bitcoin hits one million dollars inside of 90 days isn't a bet about Bitcoin it's a bit about the devaluation of the dollar yeah and also you said at the very beginning is like there's only two real Banks there's the Federal Reserve and there's Bitcoin that's and I actually also 100 that's a point that's such a good quote that's great great it's not about ethereum and all of its uh smart contracts or all that all that cool stuff it's all about just like people are going to run and they're going to flee and they're not going to think too critically about where they're going they're going to see collapsing Banks and this is a function of your average Joe or your average money manager like oh banks are collapsing and I kind of see the devaluation the dollar what is my inert spinal reflex Bitcoin it's Bitcoin that's my spinal reflex that's where I'm gonna run to and I think that's really the punch line that you're you're kind of like leading up to right that's exactly right that's exactly right it is the shelling point right you know basically you know the constant shelling point it's like coordinating without coordinating right right yep for example if uh right so you tell people hey uh meet me in New York City right and right oh there's very shelling points people can come up with but most many people will say okay I'll meet in front of the Empire State Building because Statue of Liberty they might say but that's like kind of an island-ish thing or you might say the clock in time I was gonna say the Time Square yeah yeah that's right so it's not a perfect example but it is the concept or let's say you need to meet in London or is it going to be Big Ben right so that's a better example um San Francisco will be the Golden Gate Bridge right that's like the iconic Landmark you know right so um the shelling point is how people coordinate without coordinating based on their prior information and that's what Bitcoin is right it is it is basically the thing that everybody in our space respects every crypto exchange supports it has social defense it has uh you know I'm not saying I'm not saying we will win there's going to be some serious attacks but I'm saying we might be able to win right the question is whether the currency of the People by the people for the people will not perish from this Earth and I know that sounds crazy right now okay um but that's what this one is about because um the thing about Bitcoin is it can't be seized with the key press right okay it means that all of that stealth seizure that was happening there um you know that's just like hitting buttons on a key and you know you know okay there's a billion dollars here but all of that can't happen anymore because it's outside the system it's escape the system it's literally exited the Matrix right uh and uh and then some interesting things are going to happen um and so people need to sort of be just locked on philosophically I mean the the fun the interesting about this I was going to write an article actually I'm in the middle of writing it which is that Bitcoin maximalists are best positioned like mentally for what's about to happen in my view and it's going to be fast even for them okay um hyper bitcoinization refers to not simply the color it is the collapse of all Fiat currencies against Bitcoin okay it is a gigantic Global quote redistration of wealth in a sense but it's a it's basically like all of the bills of all of the people that have run Keynesian macroeconomics because they Kick the Can Kick the Can Kick the Can they didn't have you know at least the British they gradually handed it over to the next people right they gradually handed it over to the Americans but the internet is what comes the internet is the next America I would like to see how this Maps into your your understanding and so this is a Martin koppelman saying detect the pattern and we've got a bunch of two different kinds of banks uh United States Banks and Chinese Banks all the Chinese banks are up and to the right all the American banks are down into the down into the right how does this map into you to what you're talking about here so some people are probably moving deposits see what the FED has now signaled is that the and actually the best I can show do you see Moody Moody has downgraded the entire U.S banking system okay the banking system is negative okay you know how like San Francisco it's remember I used to say like the ascending world and not you say I still say Ascent it's not about first world or third world it's the ascending role in the descending world right you know and if you've been to San Francisco it's not an ascending World place it's in a descending World place it's a you know there's it's poop in the streets and needles and it's like worse than it was 10 20 years ago whereas India's ascending world right the U.S banking system Outlook is negative here's the thing Powell has turned America into Argentina the series of Bank runs and currency crises and printing and so on that's about to begin means you you will obviously have to have some money in the US banking system to pay your bills for you know whatever so long as this crisis goes on okay however people are going to learn that you cannot trust the state you can't trust the U.S state it's like a South American you know corrupt government but but at massive scale right so a ton of people are going to lose faith in the centralized State all at once when the money is gone and um if you look at the the other tweet Ascent many Fiat banks are dead many more are going to die all because of the FED because Powell ain't Satoshi and the US is run by heirs who wrecked institutions they inherited including the accounts of dollar holders and after the FED kills its own Banks well you want your money in a U.S Bank in a system with insane Bank runs where Regulators receive depositors Powell made America Argentina so the internet is a new America all the next banks are crypto where one BTC equals one BTC the new Reserve currency of the world what's what's hard to believe about this though apology is like this is uh this is quite the statement that it happens now and that it happens so fast yeah like that's the part I can't wrap my head around I mean obviously from the Inception of bankless and and a lot of people are in this crypto Journey because we see what's going on in the background but the idea that all of this could happen over the next 90 days that's the part that's boggling to me like I always expected this to be sort of a decades-long play here and now but you're saying it's here and like what what is your certainty that this is the fire alarm that this is actually happening now like would you give is it it can't be 100 confidence is it in the in the 90 Zone I don't know but I'm gonna show you just just to re you know a bunch of digital graphs okay so here's with very relatively little four warning okay there is some warning and if you go back to December 2022 they're like you know banks are going back to the discount window again it's not something they were doing for a while and it's because the ones that had bought these bonds or whatever were like uh I need some money you guys crush me you know can you give me some money or you know I don't know what all the reasons were right but um here's another one where you had some warning and then it's digital right okay here's another yeah you had some learning there's Decline and then it's digital at the end you see what I'm saying right right by digital you mean like it's gone and it's gone it's analog up until the end and then you enter the digital age digital death right it's continuous and it's discrete it's an analog curve and then just sudden death it's not like a gradual decline all the way to the end okay you see you see my point on these this is like these are not there's not graphs I see it can happen it's just so hard to Fathom that it happens to the FED that it happens to the dollar that happens to the United States of America I know well I think really the point here is that this has been the the long-term vision of this has been predicted by the bitcoiners um uh and then I think but even Balaji is saying that like the Bitcoin is happening so fast it's gonna actually Boggle the bitcoiners minds and like of course like humans aren't supposed to we're not really used to being able to think in these terms humans don't think in exponential terms uh and so to to think that if this idea about that biology is presenting here is correct uh if that's true like we are about to enter a phase change that is uh also accelerated by technology like we're already watching that with the bank runs uh and so it's not only not only is it one of these times where like decades happens inside of weeks but we've also never had one of those moments of history where decade a decade happens in weeks with all of the technology that we have yeah so it's it's this is like World War One or something like that when people are entering World War one they were starting it uh first of all by the way let me show you that there is some forewarning okay so take a look at the next link I sent you so since Inception the US dollar the smart money has been voting against a dollar and entering Bitcoin this has been a joke chart but it's actually a really important chart you have had forewarning that the dollar is going to zero against Bitcoin for 13 years it's actually just like some of those other charts where it was like continuous you know and then it was discreet I think for part of the troubling thing here is like if what you're saying is cracked though right so Bitcoin appreciates but like isn't that the end of the United States I mean if if the dollar hyperinflates we're in for real bad times in the US and I I guess I might say Western liberal democracies as a whole and so that is hard medicine to swallow as well if that's what you're prescribing I know so here's the thing so again I'm not sure what to say because the problem is if I tell you what my world model is so the thing is I you know there's people who are like oh no you can't ever Panic people you know alarm I'm like look this I'm not I never actually call for quote panic I what I call for is understanding the severity of the situation and taking um calm conscious steps to insure yourself against it okay you know I actually did a good job I'm very glad that dalio published his book right principles do you remember this came out last year yeah it was great right so big devaluations are abrupt and episodic rather than evolutionary the six major currency transitions that have happened before have just been like once the alternative appears the old one just kind of disappears and we've kind of felt that the US has been running on reruns right Marvel movies over and over again we've got 70 year old Fed chair and Trump and Biden and so on where people are still like refined the Communists Chinese you know like they're still like in this kind of 1980s cold war war even um and you know I'm just kind of making I have nothing against Southerners I you know I like that but I'm just saying like or it's like oh my God we're standing up for you know this and that and and people people are just kind of running their old scripts where uh you know another great perhaps the best example of this is um what Powell is doing is the 1980s formula Paul volcker hiking rates and he thinks that it's that's the same move at the same um that the same thing that worked 40 years ago he can just kind of do today and it'll work in exactly the same way in the state of the world is different right so by running those old scripts that don't don't work anymore you lose and one way of thinking about it is like on the eve of world war one right in like 1913 like that was the world of kings and princes and horses and so on the restrained tension on this world because of the new clanking machines and the industrialization all of this stuff was you know something which there's obviously Tech pressure on it you had um you had these social movements you had people who wanted to vote you had Communists you had all these different things clanking and straining against this right and then you know there was a catalyst of you know a few things there's World War One there was um and just like modernity roared into being like you know like when something is born it's like got blood all over it and so on right it wasn't I'm not saying it's good I'm saying though that like you know people started World War One For example with horses and uh and they certainly didn't end it with that right the thing is that the future can't actually you know saying the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed right if you go to that next photo the the other one I sent you right all those kings it's kind of like all of these heads of Fiat States and I'm not saying they all go to zero right but those that trusted the fed and that don't have um you know either natural resources gold manufacturing or digital gold or something like that to back their fiat currency will probably be in trouble after the Fiat crisis I know that sounds like if you take the full implications of what I'm just saying there that's actually a pretty big thing okay but a lot of these states that trusted the Fed after the Fiat crisis the money is gone this has been a lot apologies and I'm sure you found like felt the full weight of the things that you're saying over the last few days um you know also on your shoulders because if this does come to pass we will wake up in an entirely new world yeah in whatever time frame whether it's 90 days or or it takes I don't know the exact time frame exactly I don't know the exact time for I'm just ringing the fire alarm to try to get people to realize the scale of the change that's about to unfold and you feel the same way a similar way as you felt to kovid in January of 2020. when you're doing the fire alarm for coven you're saying Bank crisis is imminent this is not just a regular Bank crisis this is the Fiat Bank crisis and the fall of the US dollar so prepare yourselves get to hard digital assets as soon as you can and for you that means Bitcoin that's what you're saying I'm saying that and I'm also saying um basically there's four options you can take okay and people are going to choose one of these four options the first is trust US Banks trust us media just like 2008 all the other crises there's always a crisis who cares I'm going to go back to just Tick Tock or whatever okay A lot of people do that number two is okay I actually am seeing that there are something serious going on this is now something which is like user tangible like a bank run is user tangible all the other stuff was just sort of like an Enterprise thing you know uh what I mean by that is it was just banks that had liabilities other Banks it was on balance sheets in the back end somewhere and they could work it out amongst themselves and there was an impact on you the end user do you know what I'm saying right I don't recall at least I don't know if you recall I don't remember Bank runs during the financial crisis right so depositors were taken care of or whatever then it was just like a you know moving funds around it's all made invisible okay now so number two is if it's exploded on you you're an svb or something you cannot ignore it the money is gone right and so actually a lot of people they did is actually wired money now you know where they're trusting more than the US banking system a lot of people wired money back to India okay they're getting out of the U.S banking system maybe that's what that graph is on China or something like that because the US banking system people were literally calling it and very much speak to this for a second they're like oh my God it's a bailout to want your checking account back now that's just actually a true inversion of what happened and here's why if you go to Mogadishu and you know like people tell you not to go and and then you ask for like a helicopter air lift out okay that's a bailout you took a high risk activity it's atypical you're making other people risk their lives get you out that's a bailout okay if you walk down the street and you're attacked by somebody and you're like call for the police that's a paid for that was a low risk activity you took and this police protection is part of your budget your subscriber budget as a citizen you paid for that okay similarly if you make a high risk investment that nobody tells you to make or whatever um and you want your money back that's a bailout okay if you're operating a business checking account and you're just literally just doing you know by law required to keep your money in a bank and so on with a you know 200 uh you have some expectation that these Federal Regulators that you paid for would give you some hint that the not just your bank but all the banks are insolvent especially when they knew it for months and years beforehand okay and so what actually happened is you paid for all the regulation and got none of the protection it's a narc attorney it's just like in San Francisco right you pay for the police but the only thing they do is issue parking tickets they don't stop a crazy guy from like smashing your window okay if you're like an Uber driver in San Francisco you get the tyranny of the whatever 100 parking ticket for being on the side of the road then you have the Anarchy of the guy who smashes your window and nothing happens to him okay so the same way we are going to have an arc of tyranny but for banking where you have the tyranny of assets Frozen fund seized a cbdc potentially price controls serious inflation and so on um but the Anarchy of the money can be gone and it's your fault because you're supposed to read uh the the statement and find that it hid in a footnote their 80 billion dollar loss that makes a bank insolvent that's not perfectly regulation that's not consumer protection that is a third world country you see what I'm saying that is a corrupt regime that has betrayed its citizens and the full scope of what that betrayal means see most people won't be able to process that okay some people will because they've got because what it is it's like their God has died do you know what I'm saying you know like to truly think of the U.S state as betraying you to that extent not just like making an error or something like that but telling where the banking system has lost all the money of all the people right to like an error of that extent is something which just crashes people's operating system and then what's going to happen is one of two things are a few things right first is uh they're living in they're foreigners and um they're in a place with a functional government like I have I hope that India Israel can stand up to be the leaders of the Free World and what is to follow okay second is they're in a place like you know Russia or China and if like you know what I'm saying is actually what's happened if the money is gone and this is like that final crisis okay then you have to assume that all kinds of troops get pulled back Ukraine that just stops happening Russia and China which were kind of in a in a box before and they were getting they were getting sanctions put on them and all this stuff that just stress tension loosens and you have this just Unleashed Russian bear and you know the Chinese dragon are just like Roar okay because they're let out of their cage um I mean you know could it be that like uh Taiwan is captured without a shot and tsmc now the sanctions are on the west you know quite possible very possible that if if and the only thing is by the way the fundamental premise all of this is just like with Corona right I only had one premise and that premise was this is going exponential we're going to have millions of people infected and a lot of people are going to die and nobody understands this now because they're not actually calculating out that from that and only from that I had a rubber band tension model the world and I was figuring out what things you know you know would move on that okay it wasn't a perfect you know they're things I got wrong or whatever you know I thought full face mask covering would be there but I do want to show you this which is this is Max Roser tweeting your original uh covet tweet saying the world has changed so much in just the ways biology predicted it might be almost hard to appreciate how prescient This Thread was when he wrote it at a time when nothing had changed yet one year ago today is that what you anticipate people tweeting about your original Bitcoin bit signal tweet one year from now I hope not yeah I also hope not for the record maybe [Laughter] um but um like you know I should probably tweet that I should say this a bet I hope I won't win in a sense right yeah I think I don't know if you are paying attention to your Tweet and your and your gamble uh biology I think that would actually go a long way because like kind of we said in the intros like some people are just thinking like oh he's he it's profitable for him to make this trade by tweeting this or something like that I I think people or else he wants to watch control burn something like something like this yeah yeah so I apologies I think um very very uh scary if not informative yeah and hopefully I've given you enough links to give you a sense of uh you know this is not just you know me coming up itself I don't know there's like 50 or 60 references or what have you right I have a role model here which might be wrong but that shows that this financial crisis is actually a very extreme one it uh you know I'll leave you one last thing which is uh you know the ray dalio principles for the changing World Order yeah so that's right so this um the video of it uh is um yeah you're right there are two separate books uh the video of it is really good to watch and the thing is dalio did something very smart with this video he got the concepts across with cartoons mm-hmm and with the cartoons you can kind of process it without realizing how serious what he's talking about is the collapse of Empires right lots of people fighting no money right um you know with the cartoons you can process it but then you have to like apply it that's a key thing because there's something about it where you know history is like we're on like a cycle because people live and die and so on right um and the thing about this is here's the one thing that dalio doesn't get okay and he's really smart guy he gets politics and he gets Finance right and he gets history but he doesn't get technology and so what he doesn't see is that there's actually another force that is as big as China that hopefully becomes the leader of the Free World in the aftermath and that is technology I think we Ryan and I have also shared our uh critiques of of Ray dalio is that like everything that his whole patterns and Cycles throughout history is all spot on but he just misses the next phase change as a result to crypto I think he started to get it but I don't really know how complete his understanding is about all of this um well he's he's partially he's right about one thing which is if we don't have a critical mass of people in the Free World get out to bitcoin then China is number one after this and they're out of their cage because those money going to China is like well China's the stable system China gives you stability right it doesn't give you the chaos of the US it also gives you totalitarian control of the cbdc but at least it's a stable version unfortunately a lot of people will go for that and you know the thing about this but the way I talked about this in the network State book between American Anarchy and Chinese control right um we want the decentralized center right we want to have the Free World and really like this is the moment so you know take everything you guys have said seriously over the last five years everything you've got all the concepts okay and help your guys go bankless that's it um apology we're gonna end it there this has been very helpful to walk through your brain and and to kind of understand all of the pieces that you've put together here recently and uh we'll certainly be having someone on to do the Counterpoint to um you know talk about reasons why this might not come to pass or might not come to pass so soon but uh we really wanted to unpack your brain here today and certainly uh like if what happens comes to pass it will be it it will be absolutely changing the biggest event of our lifetime and I don't think any Bank list listener will be fully prepared for it so it's worth taking a moment to understand and dissect biology's arguments to look through the references and links that we put forth in this episode and do your own research and uh you know come to your own conclusion on this and to do it fast uh I think if if things collapse in the expedient way that biology is predicting you may not have much time to put the pieces together in the aftermath of this uh biology thank you so much for coming on Bank list once again we appreciate you thanks and I'll say one last thing which is even if what you think I'm saying is crazy hopefully it will be something that now you've been exposed to at least once and as you see events unfold you might think okay some percentage of that might be correct and then take action if that makes any sense it's like a retargeting of some kind right you have a different frame or lens to to view events just like that original Corona thread where people might have thought it was crazy and then they had lens to view events so anyway all right guys get your get your coins get your Bitcoin get your coins off exchanges get to a crypto friendly jurisdiction if you can there it is that is the alarm risen disclaimers guys gotta end it here of course none of this has been Financial advice uh maybe just simple life advice life advice that's all yep Bitcoin is risky so is it so is crypto but my God the banking system is more risky than ever you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot
