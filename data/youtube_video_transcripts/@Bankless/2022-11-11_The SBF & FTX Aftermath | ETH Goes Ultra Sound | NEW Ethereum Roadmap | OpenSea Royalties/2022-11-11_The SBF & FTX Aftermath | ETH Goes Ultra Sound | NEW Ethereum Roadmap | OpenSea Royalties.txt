some good news too we'll get in the macro markets of course inflation a little bit lower than expected this month maybe a bit of a silver lining hey it's only it's only 7.9 percent bengalization happy second Friday happy November maybe I should have said unhappy David uh I see you've got the the wojak mean yeah bring your face yeah pretty sad today yeah that's not a it's not a good week it's been a rough week in crypto um probably the worst I've seen in terms of sentiment in terms of feeling walking into this roll up I mean how many live streams have we been doing over the last few days uh one one per day since Tuesday so this will be number three yeah well this is in a live stream but still same thing same you and I were up late last night with uh Kobe like oh yeah so forth yeah this is number four session yep I mean but there's just so much to cover so much to talk about and the way this event has unfolded um for those of you not not familiar of course uh we're talking about FTX SPF how SBF sandbagment read this for everyone I mean he really screwed us over and um we're gonna talk about how we feel about that uh what's what's been happening since I guess yesterday give you the summary of what's happened this week and talk about picking up the pieces I guess grab your morning coffee or maybe something a little stronger yeah if you need it today put some Baileys in that coffee are you a Bailey supposed cop no you hey you told me if you put anything in your coffee it becomes a beverage yo you take it so people need a beverage this this week this Friday David makes exception for Bailey's um we're gonna talk about that um that's gonna be a big big subject I think get you guys up to speed and uh even A lot's happened since the last time we live streamed got off the live stream at like 1am last night um also we are one year anniversary from all-time highs isn't that ironic are we supposed to be happy about that too how far are we down for all-time highs 76 crypto market cap is down 76 from 365 days ago so congrats uh it is worth noting that it was it's about one year of time from the 2017 top to the 2018 bottom that was also about one year uh and then we had a two-year bear Market where we touched that same bottom two more times uh and then it was defy somewhere some good news too we'll get in the macro markets of course inflation a little bit lower than expected this month maybe a bit of a silver lining hey it's only it's only seven point nine percent it's only 7.9 all right happy Happy Days okay uh guys of course if you enjoy the roll ups if you enjoy the work that Dave and I put into the podcast everyone behind the scenes making this happen uh make sure you like And subscribe rate and review that's how we get the top of the charts that's how you get me the dopamine hits to keep on doing this because weeks like this it's kind of hard it's rough it was a rough week I mean just we'll get into more of that later but uh but first some good news from our friends and sponsors at earnify if you're feeling down why don't you plug in your wallet your crypto wallet your ethereum address the space where you can maybe find some unclaimed airdrops I had a friend um last week text me and be like oh I listened to that earnify I plugged some of my dresses in and I walked away with three okay oh he got some dopamine good yeah good it's a little dopamine not just dopamine David I mean this is Cold Hard Cash yeah at the end of this what does ernify do yeah earn if I uh takes your ethereum address and then it scans the whole library of airdrops poapps nft mints that you may or may have not gotten uh and so it's just like the it's a little robot to make sure that it it goes and checks all of your pants pockets for the 20 bill that you left in your past Pockets but air drops tend to be worth a lot more than twenty dollars uh so all you have to do uh it's free to use but you can sign up to get some some extra perks and privileges uh it's free to use you can just put in your ethereum address and it'll go scan the blockchain to make sure that you haven't left any money in any corner of ethereum or any other blockchain for that matter good to go find your money right now on a week week like this uh go to bankless.cc slash earnify that's e-a-r-n-i-f-i to find out more about that all right David let's get into the markets deep breath you ready okay Bitcoin what's it looking like Bitcoin started the week at 20 275 down 14 and a half percent congrats Bitcoin for setting a new low for the year a new low in this bear Market uh We've ticked the bottom at fifteen thousand five hundred and thirteen dollars uh we are currently at seventeen thousand three hundred dollars uh so hit a low of fifteen thousand five hundred the new low for the year uh but back up to 17 300. David I'm gonna be honest I wasn't sure we'd ever see 15K Bitcoin but now um now now 10K Bitcoin and under is in sight right I mean we're like 50 off of that and what's crazy is this is uh 365 days of of down right for the day yeah well tomorrow tomorrow will be 366. uh but yeah we were at the one year anniversary of the Bitcoin all-time high uh where this high was 69 000 nice uh forty four dollars for Bitcoin uh down about 74 percent from the all-time high pretty brutal I mean I've seen worse though I mean uh last cycle what did Bitcoin get down to 83 yeah 85 something like this of course uh ether got to 94 all-time high speaking of ether what's that looking like on the week started the week at 15 15 50 uh down 17.8 percent to where it is currently at 12.70. uh it got up to as high as like 13 30 earlier but down to 1270 right now so down 18 on the week and uh what's this chart showing us here uh yes the ratio we are down 0.076 where we were last week to .073 uh again for what it is you know if it was last cycle ether would be wrecked during a week like this and it's holding up okay so holding up okay ratio's holding up okay but down down bad so 14 for um Bitcoin and then uh 18 yeah 18 for ether I'm pretty crazy how about the crypto market cap as a whole a new low of 830 billion dollar total market cap we are bounced back a little bit to 910 billion dollars that lower than expected uh CPI print uh has saved us a little bit um created a little bit a little bottom um yeah uh a bottom uh how about crypto punks you wanted to put some nft news in here and there was a flipping that happened it wasn't the Bitcoin flipping but it was a nft flipping yeah I am a biased Punk holder so take that with a gram of salt but punks are now once again and above Apes so the EOG nft now has a higher floor price than the Apes uh one ape a floor ape will cost you about 60 eth a floor Punk will cost you about 66 eth just a stronger holder Community is that what's happening basically it's kind of the you know the tour sleeve the settler stay yeah people with less conviction on other assets I mean punks are an older uh project as well they are the the oldest nft project they are the OG they are the Bitcoin of MSDS yeah so that is like the nft of Last Resort I guess for this uh for this entire market so uh yeah that's interesting to see uh well let's talk a little bit about the economy well we're talking about then we'll get to crypto but um inflation has officially dropped to 7.7 percent dropped to 7.7 yes and we're happy about that and the reason why we're happy is because last month it was 8.2 percent and it came in a little bit lower than expectations I think 0.2 percent below expectation so you can see the chart here this is like all the way from 1965 to 2023 and so you could say maybe we've peaked it's kind of looking like maybe we peaked sometime this summer from an inflation perspective and we're on our way down and I guess that would make sense because we're gonna get to more things later but there's layoffs it's um like the economy is turning interest rates of course have been hiked right up how could inflation continue to rise if we are spinning towards recession it really it really can't unless we get some some situation like stagflation should be even worse so this is an expected drop maybe maybe the good news is uh the FED starts to relent on their policy the good news at least for markets and what are we looking at here David yeah this is the Spy so spy jumped four and a half percent on this news uh so the index the sby index goes from 307 D4 to 390 up four and a half percent because of the drop in inflation so markets happy Market's happy I'm kind of worried about the Whiplash of CPI like what happens if CPI just like plummets to zero uh while we're laying off people uh that would be called a deflation uh which I mean we like it in ether but we don't like it in a dollar uh that's what I'm worried about but still uh inflation coming down is good we've got a long ways to go I mean I think the FED is hopeful it can get to like the three to four percent range uh if that's even possible but uh markets like that risk on assets up on that news and so is crypto although it had a much worse week after after being down bigly we had the positive CPI print uh well the lower CPI print which was positive news and then the markets including the crypto markets did like that but I mean FTX collapse yeah yeah well it's not helping us much this week uh let's just touch on the elections yeah let's not talk about crypto as much as possible this has turned into a political podcast election results for 2022 uh Senate so the um it's still undecided I get this is the U.S election of course uh still undecided election results um majority is unknown apparently each party needs to win two of three more races that are still in dispute Georgia Arizona Nevada and Georgia the runoff will actually happen in December so we won't know who controls the Senate until then uh also in the House Republicans gained six seats Democrats lost seven um that was expected but actually it's I think it's kind of expected the Republicans would there'd be some kind of a wave yeah which has not Material realize which is just the news that I've heard yes has not has not materialized but um yeah yeah it's kind of still the way it was before almost I mean no real changes we'll see who controls the Senate uh but no change is considered an L for the Republicans they wanted they wanted the Red Wave they didn't get it uh so the same is a loss for the Republicans if that's what I've heard what's interesting about this is uh crypto had a role to play a minor role of course but if you add up the numbers about according to Wall Street Journal 73 million dollars went into the 2022 elections from crypto I think SBF was like 70 million of that oh six so it was a lot he was a lot which right so we'll get we'll get to a little bit later what does this mean for crypto is the question election results and the answer I think David is what probably nothing probably probably nothing yeah I mean I don't think this impacts it I think the SPF events of this week and FTX meltdown of this week impact crypto in a big way uh which we'll talk about um David it's also layoff season what headline are we looking at yeah so Silicon Valley kind of down bad meta the face uh parent company of Facebook laying off more than 11 000 employees but they are not the only one uh Silicon Valley overall has light uh got a collective layoffs of tens of thousands so Twitter laid off 3 700 people I don't know if that was like economics related or Elon Musk related definitely Elon Musk definitely must related and that's 50 of the work Workforce right yeah oh wow I mean a combo but lots of musk in that stripe laid off a thousand people of Robin Hood laid off to a thousand people Lyft laid off 700 people open door 550 Netflix 450 uh it goes on uh yeah so collectively like tens of thousands of people laid off across the Tech sector in just the Bay Area just just San Francisco that's that's uh crazy I mean Tech just really expanded uh during covid over the past two years and now they're they're completely Contracting um it's starting to happen a little bit too David yeah Dapper Labs cutting 22 of Staff um because nft markets not not great not great yeah when's the last time you heard about NBA Top Shot oh I have not uh the the headline here says sales volumes for Dapper Labs MBA Top Shot has declined to 2.6 million dollars from 20 or from 224 million dollars in February of 2021. uh that is a 99 reduction in Revenue wow that's that's bad uh yeah that's very bad I mean that 22 might uh might ratchet up throughout all of this um you know one thing the last time I think I've heard of NBA top shots in the context of people actually starting their crypto journey through NBA top shots yeah they no longer do it they no longer maybe they have some some old nfts from NBA yeah they got into the harder stuff it brought a lot of people into crypto right brought a lot of people like I talked to ethereum and D5 it's like uh when I talk to them I'm like oh so what brought you to crypto and You're gonna laugh at this NBA top shots uh that was the thing I guess let's try to look for some bright spots here and um the big bright spot maybe the only this week I mean there are some other things that are positive that have gone on but um is uh is ethereum and the the the burn rate I mean it sucks that this was the week that ethereum finally went ultrasound because that was a milestone we had planned to actually celebrate I mean the very beginning of the uh what is the Justin Drake episode almost like two years ago now yeah not almost a year and a half ago yeah a year and a half ago uh where he coined the phrase on Bankers podcast ultrasound money um to describe ethereum's monetary policy and uh this is the week it actually went ultrasound at least ultrasound since the merge what are we looking at here David yeah this is of course the ultrasound.money website uh supply chain since the merge negative 5400 ether Ryan we have burned about six thousand each ish ether maybe maybe seven thousand in the last two three days six thousand either burnt in the last three days bringing us a negative 5 400 ether and like the this is the the through line the message here I want to convey is that this is a anti-f anti-fragile mechanism crypto broke this week liquidations happened prices go down FTX is insolvent and all of that volatility creates The Ether burn and that ether burn overall makes ethereum more secure and so the why this is like uh if the if you're anti-eath Maxi you're like oh these people are just like circle jerking about the burn like they always do maybe I I am here to say that this is while there is chaos at least ether becomes more anti-fragile because its security gets cheaper as we burn ether and so while there's destruction everywhere at least ethereum is a little bit more anti-fragile and that is because of the burn and we are now since the merge negative point zero three percent on yearly issuance and we continue to decline so this has been the bright the one bright shining star that I have that's making me a little bit happy this week Ryan yeah I mean uh and I think that's a big one in the in the context of crypto right um ethereum performed very well this week I know you're talking in some of the streams you did earlier this week about this the sense that for a lot of people who are in kind of the the ethereum bankless defy um world and didn't keep their money in kind of the the Sam coins as Kobe calls them you know ftx's of the world but also in Earth that uh solanas and some of these other assets uh and uh in FTX I like I felt someone like unaffected personally by this right of course crypto prices are down but we've already seen lower crypto prices right even even over the summer even recently um so it was it was sort of weird to feel like another case of uh the defy ethereum Community we're not insulated from this because obviously FDX is and it's out of 15 in prices on the week yeah massive down and this is terrible for everyone yet not as drastically affected as those that were maybe a little closer to the FTX Community for for instance who can't withdraw their money at this point in time and certainly our hearts go out to people who who've gotten wrecked in that way but it sort of reminds me of of Luna and Tara as well it's just like I wasn't personally affected by that because uh fortunately we were able to stay away from that catastrophe completely there are some things that smelled bad about that right there's like there's this core of crypto that has a ton of activity it's uniswap it's Ave it's maker it's compound it's a few other applications too and being like a power user of those applications while not having an FTX account never touching Terra Luna like if you have been in OG D5 1.0 ethereum applications you have been in this like tiny little like bubble of protection while it seems the whole rest of the industry has just like blown up around you that's kind of how it's felt like for me lately yeah it totally is like that scene of like somebody leaving an explosion and there's like you know everything behind them is blowing up and there's fire and mortars going off bullets whizzing by if you're if you're just tinkering with just Ave uniswap uh you know some layer twos you're you're fine I I do think look I I don't want to Discount the the role luck Place into all of that yes because look one of these smart contracts something could happen in ethereum at any point in time what do we always say this is risky it's not for everyone you could lose everything and yet I think some of the bankless principles have held up pretty well through the storm that is 2022. right even just the idea of going bankless the idea of making sure that you don't have funds on a public exchange that you're taking custody of your own keys right that thing would have saved people from Voyager from Celsius and even from FTX and that's what we're going to get into next because FTX was the bank the crypto bank that people thought was Secure people thought was safe honestly I did I thought it was fine I did if someone asked me here's the test right if someone asked you hey David I'm thinking again in crypto coinbase FTX you think one's riskier than the other like I know you have a preference but it's FDX okay what would you say I I would say yeah I think I've been asked this question before and I think I've said yeah coinbase FTX they're fine so have I it was definitely not fine uh guys we're gonna be

join over 5 million users who are getting the most out of their crypto the downfall of FTX Sam bankman freed the owner of FTX irresponsible with depositors money that is the store worry brought total wreckage to the crypto industry this week David uh could you just give us a quick recap of what happened I know we have episodes about this already if people want the full story but what's the the 90 second version 90 second version SPF Rose to fame through this trading fund called Alameda research which he is I believe like the 90 owner over um Alameda research just would trade in crypto do a lot of uh positions like hedge fund like head trading all this stuff made a ton of money he was a great Trader and that's where SBF made a lot of his initial money and that's where Alameda grew a lot of its capital and then he slowly passed off responsibility to others meanwhile he makes FTX exchange uh seemingly Sam Bateman freed is a great Builder great operator uh FTX The Exchange Rose to fame uh when in a time where no one really thought it was possible to make another exchange FTX just made a great product a good exchange good Services Good Financial tools everyone seemed to be really impressed by Sam and Sam is a figure it grew in prominence for these two massive successes he slowly passed off all of his responsibility to element of Alameda research to somebody else a team of people and totally focus and double down on the FTX Empire which grew in a crazy fashion there was always this loose association between Alameda research and FTX where Alameda would Market make on the FTX exchange making FTX extremely liquid and a great place to just have liquidity Beyond just the basics and so there were the symbiosis between Alameda research and FTX helped FTX rise in in Fame we saw FTX buy naming rights for the Miami Heat stadium we saw FTX like sign deals with uh like Tom Brady uh and and just like a huge success story out of 2021 and you know raise billions of dollars in capital then a report out of coindesk from a leaked Financial document about alameda's balance sheet reported that a lot of alameda's balance sheet all basically all their assets were the FTS FTX exchanges token ftt and it had a ton of ftt as collateral backing a bunch of loans and so Alameda had loans that were backed by ftt it was in a precarious position and that alerted CZ and now binance was an early investor in FTX CZ of course is the co-founder of binance the a different kind of exchange Empire that he's built and arrival much bigger exchange Empire yes yeah and so binance invested in FTX equity and as a result they had 2.1 billion dollars of ftt and CZ says due to recent Revelations that have come to light we have decided to liquidate any remaining ftt on our books this is largely a result of the precarious nature of ftt because it was such strong uh it was a huge position of alameda's books it was basically all about alameda's assets were basically ftt tokens people are like how did how did Alameda have such I thought they were trading like Bitcoin and ether why are so much of their assets all denominated in ftt that was a big question mark and so CZ was like okay that's that's not good uh we're gonna start selling our ftt because of this precarious nature which starts uh to First plummet the price of ftt scaring Alameda but then also trigger fears that there is some sort of contagion between Alameda and FTX because people always knew that there was a link between these two firms from SBF and these were Loosely correlated somehow and people were worried that somehow there was going to be a run on the bank on FTX because of the shared asset the shared Balance Books between FTX and Alameda which was hypothesized that turned out Ryan to be true the that there was co-mingling of assets between Alameda and FTX and so moving forward in the story the next morning after CeCe said he's going to dump all this ftt a FTX appeared to stop press the processing user withdrawals so they ran out of money and that's basically where it was revealed that uh FTX was insolvent how insolvent was FTX we didn't really know at the time we still don't know but we initially hypothesized something like one to five billion dollars of insolvency which is already a big hole uh it's now coming to be somewhere around in the 8 to 10 billion dollars that is missing from the FTX balance sheet which is largely coming out of user deposits um so what we're talking about is we've got a somebody who operated an exchange and a hedge fund and right in order to bolster the books of the hedge fund he used deposits money in The Exchange to basically to basically do that he gambled away depositors money in The Exchange I mean that would be a super simple explanation of what happened and so so now there's also it's important to know that Alameda probably was wrecked along with everyone else during the three arrows Capital contagion back in May yes the reason why they weren't is because they had this relationship with FTX and so they were able to have to not be wrecked because they FTX sent them a bailout a secret under the table bailout and it was it was a bailout of deposit with like backed by depositors funds whatever money that they had including depositors funds absolutely insane I mean before he said in our podcast is like you go to a bank you go to exchange right you deposit your funds it's not theirs to go like play with and gamble with and use in their side hedge fund it's it's supposed to stay there so that when it's supposed to when the user comes back and says okay now I'd like to withdraw my funds those funds can just be withdrawn and so the balance sheet should be very simple to deposits and withdrawals deposits and withdrawals all user user funds are deposited and then withdrawn and that completely broke and so I guess you know one of my takes about all of this is because we're still seeing what the Fallout might be in crypto and um it's absolutely massive I think this is the big biggest single event that's occurred in crypto maybe since mount gox in some ways it's sort of exceeded this because uh this is somebody who is supposed to be trusted trust in Wall Street sort of somebody he was in lobbying in DC he represented us he had the ears of senators and and uh folks in Congress he represented us as kind of like the the cleaned up version of crypto without all of the the crypto Andy Wars and shenanigans uh yes I mean he kind of didn't for the different Mystique but yes he would wear a tie in fact we've seen him in front of Congress uh kind of like talking about crypto anyway all of this just really sunk in with me last night um and uh this is yesterday evening and I was just thinking David like how surreal the last 48 hours had been as this story has has developed because like I just I don't know how to overstate how big a figure Sam was like crypto trading God exchange God like rock of um I don't know um how to how to last and how to persist and how to do things right in crypto it just his exchange he built was just a phenomenal product yeah except which is sad because that product's gone now and what's crazy to me is uh as of yesterday it was 11 days ago that we hosted this debate between between SBF and Eric sandbag benfried and Eric Voorhees and uh you remember that this is a screenshot from from that debate and Sam was lecturing us and talking to us about the merits of crypto regulation we were having this debate about crypto values and in the background David this guy had maybe an 8 to 10 billion dollar hole that was developing on his balance sheet he was talking about crypto values and discussing the merits and and costs of like defy talking about ways to regulate D5 front ends meanwhile he's like playing with depositor money he's gambling it away he's been it's got to be the most irresponsible figure that's done the most damage to crypto that I've ever seen that that this industry has ever seen and this was 11 days ago we were having a conversation with this guy I don't understand like it's even hard for me to believe that um we had this conversation like you were there right like this happened he was so frazzled he was more frazzled and inarticulate than I had ever seen him before like I've seen him give his talks at Capitol Hill and he's like decently articulate that call he was a different person uh and it's it's just interesting that 11 days later we discover an 8 billion 10 billion dollar hole in FTX well let's talk about what's developed and this is as of yeah that was all the recap yeah that was just the recap uh this is the apology that's just come out um this is a tweet thread from SBF do you want to read a few of these yeah SPF goes I'm sorry that's the biggest thing I effed up and should have done better I also should have been communicating more very recently transparency my hands were tied during the duration of the possible binance deal I wasn't particularly allowed to say much publicly but of course it's on me that we ended up there in the first place so here is an update on where things are FTX International currently has a total market value of assets at collateral higher than client deposits moves with prices but that's different from liquidity for delivery as you can tell from the state of withdrawals the liquidity varies widely from very little from very to very little what does that mean here he's saying that the he has he's saying that the value of the assets and collateral that FTX has is a sigmoor is is higher than what their client deposits are based on what like what's the value of these assets if you actually just tell them and no one will buy them yeah but he's saying that that's different from liquidity so they have the assets but they don't have them liquid we have some paper value is what you need paper value yeah SPF continues and goes the story here is one I'm still fleshing out uh every detail of but at a very high level I effed up twice the first time a poor internal labeling of Bank related accounts meant that I was substantially off for my sense of users margin I thought it was way lower my sense before leverage zero U.S liquidity ready to deliver 24 times the average daily withdrawal actual 1.7 times leverage and liquidity One Eighty percent of Sunday's worth of withdrawals but of course when it rains it pours we saw roughly five billion dollars of withdrawals on Sunday the largest by a huge margin that was the thing that a CZ triggered he basically precipitated a bank run yes with some of these things and right and that that's what he's talking about uh the 5 billion of withdrawals on just one day alone uh alone right uh and so SPS says and I saw I was off twice which tells me a lot of things both specifically and generally that I was  at and a third time I'm not communicating enough uh and it's just a reminder a third time I'm not communicating enough I should have said more I'm sorry I was slammed with things to do and didn't give you updates uh at all David why would a bank run actually matter if like I mean if coinbase got a bank run and everyone withdrew all of their eth and all of their Bitcoin right like why would that be a problem because all of the eth and all of the Bitcoin is there it's not a fractional Reserve System [Music] yeah uh and and like the the whole like line his whole tweet like uh mislabeled bank accounts clerical error that that caused an eight billion dollar hole like that's what did it I don't think so uh anyways uh so he he finishes off anyways my uh my number one priority by far is doing rep by users and I'm going to do everything I can to do that to take responsibility and do what I can so right now we're spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity I can't make any promises around that but I'm going to try and give everything I have to make that work um there are a number of players we are on talks with letters of intent term sheets et cetera we'll see how that ends up every penny of that and the existing collider will go straight to users unless or until we've done right by them after that investors old and new and employees who have fought for what's right for their career and who weren't responsible for any of the ups um because at the end of the day I always see a CEO which means I was responsible for making sure that things went well I ultimately should be I've been on top of everything I clearly failed in that I'm sorry um uh so what does this mean going forward I'm not sure he loves to say I'm not sure um first Alameda research is winding down uh they are probably liquidated uh they aren't doing any of the weird things that I see on Twitter and nothing large anymore uh one way or another soon they won't be trading on FTX at all second in any scenario in which FTX continues operating its first priority will be radical transparency transparency probably all we should have been giving giving exactly giving us close to unchain chair experience as I can so that people know exactly what is happening on it kind of like defy kind of like D5 transparency of D5 yeah uh yeah I mean I feel like that's that's okay he goes on there was there was one thing he said um a lot of sorry is of course with uh this tweet number 20. at some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner so to speak he's talking about CZ but you know glass houses so for now all I'll say is well played you won heavily implying that CZ was his downfall and of course there was that CZ uh tweet on Sunday that precipitated part of this but if he wasn't running a fractional Reserve System where he was lending out depositors money it wouldn't have been a problem right so CZ kind of poked some holes in the structure and the whole rotting thing fell down and it's his fault that it was a rotting structure to begin with and then a few little pokes would if a few tweets can collapse your Empire you should not you gotta you might have a problem you might have a problem by the way did you see this uh this is a a tweet from Kobe uh that's kind of related to uh to sbf's thread but there is some um similarities in the way Chef yeah and Chef Nomi of course was uh Sushi swap founder that the OG Sushi swap founder who did the OG Sushi swap rug which kind of gave this Sushi swap curse in the first place uh and after rugging the treasury out of sushi swap Chef Nomi tweeted to everyone I  up and I am sorry which is kind of the same language yes which is what Kobe's pooping out I'm sorry that's the biggest thing I up and should have done better interesting interesting anyway there were some time well that wasn't the only association between Sushi and Sam bankman free that was uh there's been more uh there's been uh relations I mean at this point David I would not be surprised this would not surprise me in the least we saw we saw dokwan behind uh those algo stable coins as an Anon and then start Rick Sanchez he telegrams me and told me about yeah baseball was it basis cache was his face original ethereum algo stable coin would not surprise me in the least uh so I don't know what do you make of that um was it an apology is it just a nothing burger like what what is he doing here what is he trying to accomplish I don't know man I don't know the big question I think is where he's going to find the 8 to 10 billion dollars to fill that hole deposits money because uh right so right now FTX is worth one dollar it is on the market to anyone who wants to buy it for one dollar if you buy FTX for one dollar you are taking on eight somewhere between eight eight ish billion dollars of liabilities you get you get the FTX Empire which it comes with the low low price of eight billion dollars of liabilities absolutely brutal and of course uh CZ looked at this apparently and then completely uh walked away like hell no yeah it took him about 24 hours to reject that deal this is also cost SPF from a net worth perspective of course like at his Peak uh I don't know he was in the 20s of billions something like this I I've heard close to 30 billion um but he lost an estimated 15 billion dollars which at the time as nearly 94 of his total wealth I bet that's even more now like I mean who knows right where he's gonna end he could be at zero yeah uh definitely costs him a lot what is this tweet David uh yeah so this is okay so at this point we are on the frontier of the story so things are now developing uh but tether has frozen ftx's USD address uh so uh tether uh or FTX all the tether that FTX has about 46 million dollars of it um is now Frozen uh you could only imagine that Regulators came knocking on tether's door I said hey go freeze ftx's uh tether Supply and tether was like sure I'm happy to do that yeah happy too and of course um I mean usdt is just kind of an IOU it's not like actually money so um I mean they can do this sort of thing whenever they want to um there's hopefully there's there's assets backing this money the money wasn't really lost um Gary Gensler has entered the picture a little bit here right you could imagine he'd have some things to say so he went on CNBC earlier this morning at our time of recording and uh what did he say uh he said that he Gary was Hoodwinked by FTX after meeting with them in March and says he is now building the evidence building the facts which often takes time as soon answer as to what he is doing with FTX a lot of us were to be fair yes like Gary in particular all right this is another it's his job to not be it's true uh so Gary also tweeted out I'll be joining squawk CNBC at 8 A.M Eastern so that was this morning to discuss recent developments in the crypto markets and Collins Belton he's a lawyer actually interviewed about the tornado cash stuff uh he replies to this tweet out of Gary and says ideally you spend you'll spend some time to explain how once again the commission's enforcement priorities focused on entities trying to deploy technology to prevent these market failures and asymmetries while you are meeting with the perpetrators or overlooking their malfeasance and so this is just a tweet of a picture of Gary's Tuesday March 29th schedule which was a meeting with like eight different FTX Representatives Executives uh so it's interesting that Gary Gensler and FTX had met and but did you see this move uh Gensler is definitely distancing himself from SBF and FTX and a lot of politicians who receive political donations and have been in car conversation with SPF are are doing the same thing you've got to imagine I mean SBF is just like toxic at this point it's crypto's biggest it's not a Ponzi scheme but it's like it's a scheme of that type right and so no one wants to be associated in DC with that this is part of why this is going to cost crypto so much is we've taken a major black eye here and lost a whole lot of legitimacy from uh the serious adults I think you know The Regulators DC Wall Street institutions uh that sort of thing Ryan this this is uh developing uh we have an email with Tom emmerstaff to to try and get him on the show to talk more about this but he retweets Gary gensler's tweet about joining squawk CNBC and Tom emmer representative Tom emmer says interesting Gary genzler runs to the media while reports to my office allege he was helping SBF and FTX work on legal loopholes to obtain a regulatory Monopoly we are looking into this uh that is all we know at this time uh it was the fear of the crypto industry that spfs work in DC was to specifically produce regulatory operatage for FTX by closing the door behind them after making sure that whatever they were doing was legal even closing the door on all of defy right on the on D5 right and so uh Tom emmer says that they had reports that Gary Gensler and SPF were working to create legal loopholes to create a regulatory Monopoly uh I I hope we can get Tom emmer on the show to talk about this soon that is interesting more more developing to of course Elizabeth Warren weighed in on this and said the collapse of when the largest crypto platform shows how much of the industry appears to be smoke and mirrors we need more aggressive enforcement and I'll keep pushing the SEC to enforce the law to protect consumers and financial stability so Elizabeth at face value I love that tweet I don't have any problem with that tweet the collapse of one of the largest crypto platforms show how much of the industry appears to be smoke and mirrors that's what FTX was it was smoke and mirrors yes and so I do not have a problem with that we need to be more aggressive enforcement and keep pushing the SEC to enforce laws to protect like I would if this means that we are forcing the SEC to do more great fine I don't do more that's helpful to do that prevents uh the actual problem like it's it's definitely a problem if if Gary Gensler is kind of setting up in Monopoly for crypto Bankers like SBF and using regulatory power to do that um Brian Armstrong's response to Elizabeth Warren right under this tweet I thought was good too uh he says FTX was an offshore exchange not even regulated by the SEC Elizabeth the problem is that the SEC failed to create regulatory Clarity here in the U.S so many American investors and 95 of trading activity went offshore punishing U.S companies for making this for this makes no sense and that is actually the facts of the case yeah it wasn't ftx.us which was more regulated in the U.S which is fine if you have Assets in FTX us you are fine so if you're an American and you're using FTX us you're totally fine yeah all all deposits are are there withdrawals are enabled and that's like one percent of all of us it's the minority of the business because they pushed out it was put it was pushed out but also because you know they could actually take customer deposits and go gamble them if they were not inside of the United States right so Brian's making the case hey you have to work to make it easier for retail to have safe access to these products and you're not doing that with the current regulatory regime David there's also some talk of maybe some FTX Transit transactions appear to be processing so of course no one can get their funds out of FTX that's locked that was a one-way ticket they they no longer exist they're not there but we're looking on chain and uh some things do seem to be withdrawing what's this yeah so this is uh Steven out of the block who's done some great uh research and snooping on chain snooping but just notice that funds were coming out of FTX and going into Ferris accounts no one knows how or why but that is what we are able to see on chain this is Larry Cermak says the withdrawals from FTX seem to be really weird some of them actually go to the binance deposit addresses and some of them appear to be fresh wallets which could which could indicate a consolidation pretty large 100 000 processing as well what all of this is I don't think we know so I think one of the biggest pieces of this story is everyone a lot of people trusted Sam and a lot of people were wrong about Sam a lot of people were were duped I think myself and you included not fully trusting Sam not not ever trusting fully a centralized exchange but to think that FTX could just evaporate that they were like gambling away their depositor's money that that was Unthinkable to me this is a tweet thread from some of the people that were sticking up for FTX and SPF in the beginning there was a lot of this chatter as the rumors persisted that hey maybe something's going on at FTX and Alameda you should look into it this is somebody an account austerity sucks I don't delete tweets so I'm not going to delete this even as people laugh and Troll and mock me yes I was wrong the Tweet stays up um kudos for keeping the Tweet up on November 6 this was the tweet that the the the poster posted imagine thinking Alameda is the next three hours capital side effect of the increased counterparty due diligence process he goes on anyway it was this conversation like they're not going to go three hours Capital everything's fine it's out there they're so responsible yeah I mean look at Sam he's like right the Pinnacle of responsible exchange operator he's kind of a a younger um faster moving Brian Armstrong this is actually from some of the employees that that respond to this threat and this is a an employee named Zane Tackett many people internally and externally were fooled I'll leave my tweets up as well and take all the he I deserve for defending something I didn't have all the details on uh somebody says I can't believe this is real Zayn you're not the only one man but in a state of complete shock he goes on to say I don't want to speak for others remember this is an employee of FTX I don't want to speak for others but just complete disbelief and feelings of betrayal what bothers me the most is that I went out and defended FDX and Sam in public said the news was fud we're fine when they knew that wasn't true and they didn't have the decency to warn me employees as well feeling betrayed by this uh what do we do about this David I mean I I guess I have kind of two questions for you it's like first how long you think this is going to take to recover I mean this is clearly a wound in the crypto industry and then uh I want to ask you where we go from here but time to recovery how long is it going to take this one to heal I mean we've had wounds in the past we've definitely had uh damage before this isn't the first time but how about this how long will it take for us to get out of this one how long is it going to take to forget the name FTX oh I don't think we're ever going to forget the name FTX for normies to forget the name but yes I guess Mount gox is kind of faded except for the the crypto historians who bring it up right it's I mean yeah we're we're not we're going to be living with this for a while I I think my take is um years David um yeah I think it's yours and and um you know I'll say it again I I don't think any single individual has ever done more damage to crypto than than SPF I mean things like as far as total crypto market cap uh we lost more Mount gox than we did in FTX okay but there's something different about this and the difference is Mount Cox was not taken seriously by anybody right like crypto was it was in his infancy and like the token distribution of Bitcoin at the time was still so much more con uh more concentrated Mount gox had like 6.5 of all Bitcoins of an exchange it was magic the Gathering exchange yes the name yes and uh the Mark carpellis was Mark carpelli's he was kind of like this neckbeard guy he wasn't going to Congress to testify for regulation rubbing shoulders with Gary Gensler a hundred percent so the thing the thing that will take a long time to recover and I'm not necessarily saying actually markets David I I don't necessarily think I don't necessarily think it'll take two to three years for markets to recover I'm just talking about the the black State like I'm just talking about the legitimacy recovery right the Ontario pension fund was an investor in FTX one of the first Pension funds to do things in crypto right when's the next time a pension fund is going to do this when's the next time a senator is going to take a meeting with somebody in the crypto industry all right they're distancing themselves from it right how much we have we have like just such a smaller Foundation to stand on yeah we have made like the the work for people like Brian Armstrong and Jake Stravinsky and people who we need to have trust we have made their jobs 10 times harder as a result of this totally dude I just I I can't I feel like we're coming in the night after a crazy house party right and like the kids have been super irresponsive this is this is Ryan the dad I guess coming out the kids have been super irresponsible like there's Furniture broken computer stolen like dude there are kids who drove home drunk and crashed and died that's what it is you know it's even worse than that and and the cops are you know showing up and then we have to pick up the pieces in our community for like and why and like why why did this happen I mean FTX was a fantastic exchange it was a good product it worked yeah it was good you had a product Market fit but you had to be what you had to run a hedge fund you had to run it as a  Ponzi scheme dude so where do we go from here is the next question like how how do we actually start recovering I mean here's the thing here's the story about 2022 is it's just a story of this keeps happening and if it was just one thing if it was just FTX you know that would be one thing but no we had we had uh through US capital but I mean before that we had do Quan uh totally Celsius Celsius and then I saw you tweet this out by the way um okay answer me this uh three years Capital liquidated Alameda liquidated FTX insolvent then who made the money and who shows up Richard freaking heart goes hi there I made all the money okay this dude is a scammer he he runs he he's got a coin called pulse he's preying on people making tons of money and he's actively scamming and I feel like our industry is still full of people like this for every vitalik for every Brian Armstrong for every uh Hayden Adams or stani from Ave we have like a hundred Richard hearts and that just sucks so what do we do about this how do we move forward I got nothing man how you how are you feeling about this David it's like we have these like super awesome foundations and this like they just keep on enabling the worst do you think that it's hard to adjustify what the hell we're doing here man do you think this is a um a layer zero problem is it a problem with kind of the social layer it's like if we'll make these super cool applications and then scammers just can leverage them better it's like we're running out of ways to explain it to normies so when someone asks you about crypto after this week do you have a different answer for them about why I don't even want to talk about it I mean I think you I think you're like reflecting how a lot of people feel right now uh We've really just been brutalized by this I guess I'll give my take on where we go from here um and let me know if you have any other thoughts David I know this one hit you really hard not that not that you had any funds at risk right um it's just what it's just like the impact the social impact uh it's just the yeah what is it how do like why why is this hitting you so hard do you think versus the other ones it just gets worse the more that it happens it's just I don't know man one answer I think for us is um going going back um I think in our live stream last night Kobe mentioned this too if like you know where do we go after this and his answer was I don't know maybe somewhere like 2016 2017 something like this um and I really feel like we need to take a step back and um reevaluate kind of why we're here as an industry um you know that you know that phrase that from the earliest bankless podcasts we're talking about like protocols not people that's where we that's where we put our trust in I feel like crypto believed that at one point in time and a segment of crypto still does but we lost a whole bunch of that with the fast money and the demagogues and the Richard Hearts like I feel like we lost our way um and I don't mean everybody they're still fantastic people building incredible things but I mean enough that it made a difference enough that it enabled the ftx's of the world and the Alamedas and the three hours capitals and uh the Terrors of the world and I think what we need to do is is go back and ReDiscover the principles and the reasons this industry exists it's all about it's code not Kings that's what we're that's what we're trusting in it's protocols not people and this is about going bankless not trusting another Banker maybe I'll I'll throw out some some hope for you David because uh feels like you're pretty down on this but like um defy weathered this quite well um ethereum weathered this quite well I mean the the problem that we saw was with a centralized Exchange is with another bank and one of the reasons I think we started this uh this podcast and uh and this movement which uh bankless sister I'm glad that you're you're joining us on and you've been on with us is um to make sure that crypto didn't replace the old system with a new system of bankers it's no good if we just swap out Jamie Diamond for SPF right I mean what what do we gain what do we benefit from and I felt like over the past two years or so particularly in this in this bull market we were starting to Veer towards that where the bankers were getting more and more control We we forgot about first principles of like why we're here uh and we put trust in the wrong people and I'm hopeful David that this is actually like a another wake-up call another cleansing process for us uh another reason to go back to those roots um and ultimately uh I think we'll end up stronger on the other side it doesn't feel like that in a week like this but I'll just remind people ethereum kept going D5 kept going we had the transparency we have the crypto economic protocols we just didn't use them and the system broke where they weren't in use that's right I remember I remember uh that there's one part out of um our interview with palenia and they were they said um I'm so bullish on a human trust that we don't actually need protocols in the future like I think that's what's missing is like I want to be able to trust SPF I want to be able to hand him my private keys and then get them back later with all the funds intact I feel like I can do that to Brian Armstrong but like at this point like well I don't even know man like who the hell's left this sounds like it's a deeper thing it's like a faith in humanity kind of or faith in the industry faith in the people in the industry faith in the the layer zero yeah yeah that's the struggle here yes well it's like who are the biggest characters of the last year like we have these Cult of personalities we have like dokwon and like Alex oshinsky tried to make this about him and like suzu in three hours and Danny sesta and then SBF like everyone's got everyone's who's super loud grows this massive cult of personality around them and they all f it up every single one of them and like that's why I just respect the hell out of Brian Armstrong so much just because like he does it's not about him it's not about him and he doesn't want it to be about him it's one of those it's where there's that line of just like the people that you want to be empowered don't want power and the people that want Power you don't want them to be in power yeah I um I will say David uh a lot of the people that we've that we've met in crypto though over the past three years four years they are here for the right reasons um so um you know the which point I would quit this industry is uh if uh vitalik butyrin screwed us over and I'd be like faith in humanity lost yeah but there's enough vitalics there's enough Brian's there's enough people on the bankless journey that are um doing this for the right reasons and who care about these core founding values and I actually think we're just going to get back to rediscovering these things and hopefully build build this thing back stronger um why does it take a pain to learn like we're the most dumb monkeys of all time dude like we're supposed we're supposed to be able to learn without having to feel pain pain is like the last resort like we're supposed to be smart I don't know were you smart the first cycle how smart were you uh I mean I bought a bunch of 2017 how smart was David was he why was he now I'm thinking a lot smarter than I than I was originally letting on you think you were smarter than well that all the other dumb monkeys in this industry that keep giving Bankers their money yeah I mean I I think it's just it's just every generation has to learn these things uh and um yeah like I said I mean the systems that used our crypto economic protocols that use defy held up in all of this you know and the flaws in the system were where we had trusted intermediaries and isn't that the freaking point of crypto to remove the trusted intermediaries right but we're we're not even doing that like no one's a few people are using that stuff more more than I mean every year it's a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more and um yeah I I think we'll get out of this guys um we got more to cover some ethereum roadmap stuff we're going to talk about uh the seizure of four or 3.4 billion dollars from some dude's Closet in Gainesville Georgia which is crazy but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible in all of my years in crypto I've never been hacked scammed or lost money to a thief and a lot of that credit goes to my ledger Hardware wallet the love your Nano X and The Ledger Nano S Plus Hardware wallets allow users like you and me to secure and manage all of our crypto assets

by going and visiting shop.ledger.com if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network alright guys we're back Dave is feeling better because we are looking at the ethereum roadmap the new version a new vitalik buterin roadmap just dropped this is ethereum it's got all of the stages David we're looking at the merge The Surge The Scourge The Verge The Purge and the splurge and if you were paying attention you would have noticed there's a new urge The Scourge is new uh so we'll walk through the scourge which is to ensure reliable incredibly neutral transaction including inclusion and avoid centralization amongst Mev risks so this is has to do with all of the increased emphasis on uh censorship resistance of ethereum so he's carved out this new urge and put some things that fit under this category things that already existed but now we have an urge to to explain it and also vitalikudin would like you to know that all of these things are happening in parallel this is not a Serial order of operation starting from the merge and ending at the Splurge all of these things are being built worked on in parallel from left to right and this is this is the updated state of the the ethereum roadmaps new here David I mean this is everything that you know are there any other major features here anything unexpected nope everything else is the same like he's just like moved forward the the progress bars I guess yeah he's added some some new things here but uh um it's more or less it's more or less what we would expect it now if you want uh I think the most recent thing that we've heard on um from vitalik on the road map uh check out our previous episode we did that what six weeks ago made us a little longer with vitalik where he goes through some of the road map and I think he's reflected here too David we got open C they are creating new tools to help artists collect royalties on chain what does this mean yeah so there's been this royalty problem in the nft world where uh you have royalties baked into tokens but they're actually not in force at the Smart contract layer level which actually makes sense right because if you own an nft and you want to transfer it to another wallet address another one just like go from wallet a to wallet B you just want to send it to someone yourself you want to gift it you don't have to pay the royalty because it's not a sale so where do the royalties actually come in well they come in at the exchange level but the exchanges have to opt into royalties in order for royalties royalties to be paid that kind of sucks it does kind of suck it makes it makes royalties and opt-in thing which kind of ruins the point of a royalty and so openc uh Devin finzer and openc said that we are making a better system so they have made a new little widget to help enforce royalties for tokens that uh have royalties and so I think the way that this works is that if you uh want to add this little widget to your nft it makes that NFC only salable on exchanges that opt into this little widget oh so you write that in code though you can write that in code yeah and so it's a it's a step in the right direction to making sure that we keep royalties into the tokens which is one of the reasons why nfts have made the inroads into the artist communities in the first place yeah like I I choose not to pay royalties right that shouldn't be a decision available to you um William peaster had a whole article on this about the future of nft royalties and metaversal if you're not subscribed to metaversal by the way that's a bankless sub newsletter if you're into the nft space uh piece is by far the most useful and newsletter that exists that's metaversal metaversal.banklisthq.com of course uh super rare doing some nft stuff too they're pulling a Kevin Rose here it feels like and creating like a curator pass for art yeah it's basically like a uh a pass that gives you privileged access to the super rare ecosystem uh so a monthly airdrop from a legendary artist they claim uh three times opportunities a month to win a one-of-one unique uh nft uh an exclusive packs Pass Holder Community Access and additional benefits to be announced I think it's just gonna be like the um the membership passport towards super rare I think this is a business model that many people are going to be experimenting with ah big fan of passports David how about you oh I love I love nft passports my man also experiments uh hustle experiments this is crazy communities did you catch this story by the way it's like it was just before all the FTX news broke but um the US apparently sees 3.36 billion dollars worth of bitcoin they did this a year ago but they just announced it earlier this week and this is from a guy who stole 50k Bitcoin from the Silk Road so you know still Silk Road OG kind of uh drug for simpler times Marketplace 10 years ago somebody stole 50k worth of bitcoin and this guy was just hanging out of his house in Gainesville Georgia I guess the FED knocked on the store one day it's Gainesville yeah and uh you know it was like hey we know you have something and I'm not sure what the process went like from there apparently he voluntary and in quotes it kind of gave up the crypto to him I'm sure there's some plea Bargains involved I'm sure there's a lot involved here uh but yeah sit can you imagine sitting in Georgia with three billion dollars in your basement somewhere worth a Bitcoin not not in the basement do you know where he hit it Ryan no uh so the quote the quote from the gainesvilletime.com I'm reading it right now uh the the uh it was a small computer in a underground floor safe that was submerged under blankets in a popcorn tin in the bathroom closet or something oh my god well sir he was bankless though wasn't he I mean didn't have to worry about FTX just had to worry about this problem of what to do yeah if you if you own your own assets you can still be in trouble for stealing them and just well just a reminder on-chain crime is is also forever it is also immutable so what happened was uh the feds the authorities upgraded their on-chain analytics tools and Were Somehow able to uh to find this individual uh and uh go request those funds be returned uh I'm not sure what happens to it from there David that'd be an interesting story if this is the authorities just auction this off uh they will I think that's how they did it last time and people really really liked it what was what did they auction it from I can't remember I think it was I think it was a Silph Road it was Ross ulbrich's uh uh Bitcoins from Adam Draper bought a bunch and Adam Draper bought a bunch and everyone wanted them because they assumed that if the government is selling them the Bitcoins that they are government approved Bitcoins uh so they went for a premium and Adam Draper paid that premium I don't think that premium was has been Justified but uh well but he paid a lot less for them I don't know than the hundreds of dollars per Bitcoin oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely a premium at the time yeah I see I see uh yeah so pretty crazy and by the way that's the second largest uh Financial seizure in history um the other thing that's happening given what we were just talking about you might be excited about this David I am the SEC issued a subpoena to influencers promoting hex pulse chain and pulse ax these are all your heart projects yeah uh yeah Ponzi type projects promoted by Richard Hart and a collection of influencers we are not going after Richard Hart sadly where does Richard Hart live and can we go get him there I'm sure they're going after I'm sure it's some I'm they can't just go after the influencers you're not Richard Hart right yes yeah where I'm Googling this where does Richard Hart can we just say can we just say this is what the SEC should be doing thank you yes like thank you thank you SEC this is what we want this is what crypto has always asked for is your help in identifying and rooting out and uh bringing the scammers to Justice don't stop legitimate entrepreneurs and real businesses but give Clarity to our industry help Brian Armstrong with coinbase so that 95 of trading activity doesn't happen outside of the U.S uh and then also help us collect some of the scammers there's a lot of work to do in this space as you just said crypto still has a lot of uh scammers Shady individuals to go chase after so you can keep yourself busy there and that's what's happening with some of these influencers I don't know he's from America I don't know where he lives this article there's nothing yeah I can't imagine well it's not in the U.S not in Gainesville Georgia huh not in Gainesville yeah all right this is a tweet out of uh library.com it says we lost sorry everyone what is this about uh well library was going up against the SEC about a Securities offering so the SEC sued them for issuing Securities uh they say that they violated Securities laws by selling the native LBC tokens without registering as a U.S Securities in exchange with the U.S Securities Exchange Commission uh and so that this happened back in March of 2021 so a little bit over a year and a half ago the SEC alleged that the LBC tokens were Securities that the startup had violated Securities laws by selling them without registering blah blah the library pushed back claiming the LBC tokens were not Securities of course and that the SEC did not give it fair notice at the sale of LBC uh were subject to Securities laws just violating the company's rights to due process and but they have lost this legal battle with a specific Judge and the problem with this and this is coming out of Gabe Shapiro is that the library judge reasons that even if the team is completely silent about efforts no promises no promotions no contracts but then they pre-mind the token to give them them themselves some tokens that alone creates a sufficient expectation of profits from their efforts in a common Enterprise to pass the Howie test a very bad result basically just the mere act of giving oneself tokens is enough to produce a common Enterprise is the precedent that was just set and that's bad because that basically takes care of the whole industry it means a lot of things are tokens according to our Securities according to this judge now it's one a judge um yeah this is not a supreme court this is one case uh but yeah there's going to be some more fights ahead involving this for sure Library says the most part about this whole situation is that even after five years of fighting and a Court ruling we still honestly do not know how to legally launch a public blockchain in the U.S does anybody that's the question what do we do nope I mean this is an example of okay uh go find kind of the the scammers in the Richard hearts of the world um but allow the legitimate entrepreneurs and businesses to legally compliantly launch a token figure out how to do it what are the bounds we don't have any Clarity still even after five years and uh libraries just been been stifled out the web 3 Foundation although polka dot is claiming a different experience in working with the SEC so uh I don't know if you read this tweet thread it was sort of a mysterious oh it's weird it is weird they treated this out I understand it web3 Foundation this is polka dot um the foundation that guides the polka dot project announces polka dots native token dot has morphed and his software not a security explanation they're announcing that their native token dot has morphed and is software not a security they're announcing that it's not a security it's just like you can do that like I am not a criminal we this is not a security you could just do that um and so I was like okay there must be something here um I actually read the post and the post doesn't say very much more David it basically says they they took Gary Gensler up on his invitation of come in and talk to us okay and after three years of going in and talking to the SEC now they're not a security wait Gary gensler's been around for three years I don't know whoever it is okay they've been entitled Clayton whoever whoever was previous to Gary Gensler and I don't know that that's how it works like there's no kind of letter produced you just it's just so come in and talk Somebody went through the Dark Forest of talking with the SEC and on the other side we get this announcement that they are not a security and we don't have any sort of details as well no no for a for A to B there's just like complete Black Box between those two steps right and there's not getting clear there's not even the confirmation from the SEC that this is there's just a post that says [Laughter] from the project itself well actually you know maybe this is a little bit of 4D chess if they are announcing that they have worked with the SEC and they are not a security yeah and then the SEC is like that's what this is no you're not we didn't say that well are they like forcing them into giving them Clarity I don't know it's like me first not it it's like anything not it yeah I literally think that's what's happening because um there's nothing substantiating this from the SEC no evidence produced just that they came in and talked and now suddenly they're not a security they're just software fantastic wonderful uh UK bank Santander will block payments to crypto exchanges well I will block payments to Santander that's the headline I don't know that they care David but uh yeah we'll do what we can I it's not gonna make it I don't know how Banks could do this uh this is cool on the releases side with Sarah and cooking up xerion prepares to take on metamask

didn't get a chance to go through the questions uh to the nation so uh I think I'm just going to ask a question that's probably on everyone's mind in Bank list right now which is is crypto dead is crypto dead people are saying that the collapse of FDX is proving that uh there's nothing really there in crypto that instead that it's dying that's not ready for for mainstream that it never will be uh once again crypto is it dead David what do you think the whole point of crypto is that it cannot die that is why we're here you know you know Ryan that I just love the comment the the intersection of like nature and crypto systems crypto economic systems and that's why I'm here if there wasn't this property of anti-fragility in these crypto systems that I wouldn't be here the whole point is that this biomimicry of the crypto World means that it cannot die it can take a punch it can take a bullet it can take 10 bullets it can get its head chopped off and it will always come back if you just give it enough time FTX Sam bakeman freed is not crypto the reason why Bitcoin ether some of these the uniswap these things cannot die that's the point uh people may forget about them but eventually they will return as they always do because these are anti-fragile systems and if you are anti-fragile you will always come back it is inevitable that crypto takes over it's inevitable that uh you know ether goes up in price so long as ethereum gets built upon and so crypto cannot die that's why we are here dig in let's let's get some grit here I mean do you really think that someone by the name of Sam bankman free he literally had Bank in his name and we gave him billions of dollars what were we doing do you think we're going to let Sam bankman free kill crypto he can't kill crypto he does no one has the power to kill crypto uh yeah I I mean I think the answer as it has been in the beginning for this industry is returned to these values of defy ethereum and going bankless let's get to some takes this week David this one from uh Hunter uh Hunter Horsley he says this the future of the crypto industry is two paths number one onshore regulated U.S platforms and firms or number two fully decentralized investors have lost trust for the in between the whole cedify thing yeah remember this whole like blend of like yeah we can have a blockchain but it's like fintech it's like it's the space in the middle that is just ripping the shreds and I think that's what my take was like the uh the fintech bro or the um the finance bro era of crypto is over I feel like that's what we got a lot of it back to being cyberpunks yeah Cypher punks or you go full bank one or the other cypherpunk or Bank yes and this fits into my model of if you can be regulated you ought to be regulated if you can't be regulated that means you're fully decentralized and you are regulated by code which is the whole again the point of why we're here this is uh some context for us the worst events in crypto history the mount gox hack 20 uh 2014 the Dow hack 2016 the Terra Luna collapse 2022 FTX sells to binance 2022 three arrows Capital collapse 2022 of course FTX didn't sell the binance but the FDX collapse we'll call it three of the worst events in that list in crypto happened this year if you survive this year you've earned your stripes yeah yeah this actually really makes me reconsider like last bear Market was bad because we all ran out of money but this bear Mark is bad because everyone we ran out of legitimacy yeah we ran out of legitimacy yeah I um yeah I think at the end of this tweet I really really like if you survive this year you've earned your stripes oh definitely I remember uh I think it was when I think it was like 2020 ish early 2020 where somebody called me an OG for the first time a crypto OG yeah and I got into crypto in 2017. it's because I survived it I didn't I didn't feel like an OG but somebody called me an OG in 2020 and then more people started calling me ogs and more people started call me an OG I mean if you got in in crypto in like maybe early 2020 I think your time to start being considered an OG is pretty damn soon here you've earned it yeah if you're through here on the other side I I think that this bear Market is no less harsh than the the the 2018 bear Market 2018 was harsh because we all ran out of money but we didn't get rug pulled we didn't get scammed we didn't have these collapses we were just poor uh and now like many of us did stupid things with icos yes yeah uh this making it through the gamut of this bear Market I think was maybe minimum twice as hard you're going to feel great on the other side you're going to deserve the hell for sure uh you're gonna feel great um this is a take from you David I'm going to read it the sad part is this week's events proved why we need defy but the D5 brand has lost meaning Luna sesta cronyier farming old school Defy is the bright shining star keeping me going uniswap die Rye Ave gnosis but we don't even have a name for it David is sad you have been sad this episode David that's not like you you're super like so um defy as a brand yeah we've lost our brand bam and this is actually this was in uh came out of an inspiration from conversation with vitalik I was having an in telegram so actually this is basically vitalik's take but he didn't tweet it so I did um but yeah man like what do we even call like the good stuff because like even the defy brand like web3 no one takes that name that name seriously anymore Defy is now associated with scams for the outside world like what do we call the good stuff what do we what do we call the protocols that are actually anti-fragile like we don't even have a name for that or even our name has been stolen from us well we don't I mean but this has happened to other names in the like blockchain you remember you remember blockchain used to mean something and then it would Enterprise blockchain and then it got kind of deluded and stupid but yeah it pains me the most I think to uh to lose the term defy um remember when we originally wanted to call this whole thing open finance never stuck uh I don't know about that maybe maybe bankless Finance maybe there's a future for that yeah maybe we just yeah we just call it bankless we'll just do that we'll do it see if anyone else does yeah people do this is another take thank God Gary Gensler chose to protect us from checks notes Kim Kardashian I feel so protected Gary uh what's the background on this there I mean there was a settlement with Kim Kardashian from pumping a token for for pumping a security and then they charge Kim Kardashian and then Gary Gensler went on the speaking tour to say hey we got Kim Kardashian got a promoting and got her the bad guy yeah meanwhile I'm gonna go meet with Sam bankman freed for lunch eight billion dollars in the whole billion later uh very sad although to be fair to Gary a lot of us missed that one a lot of people but it's okay it's not our job it's his job that's his job all right all right fair enough all right can you find something to be bullish on gotta ask you that question as we do every week what are you bullish on so Ryan I uh I bottom tick to Ether so far uh is what I'm I'm bullish on so I don't know the trading vernacular what's bottom ticking mean David are you is that you are you asking me I know it I know what bottom picking is so I set I set two limit orders one at 11.50 ether and one at 10.75 I think the bottom of eth was like uh 10 38 dollars one thousand thirty eight dollars uh and so my buys went through like while I was sleeping I don't usually set limit orders I usually just hit Market buy um but uh had some cash uh bought on coinbase which I don't usually do uh but I usually use the Gemini but this time I use coinbase uh for reasons um and uh I just feel really good because it's up since then and so I just feel good about buying at least what is a local bottom uh and let me tell you if I had bought like two days ago and then it dumped I'd be feeling way worse uh but I'm just bullish on uh taking the bottom I've ticked the bottom pretty well so far you must believe in the future of this whole ecosystem you're still buying eth at these prices yeah yeah it's the only thing I really believe in man like Keith is still the asset you return to yes is this kind of what the big Bitcoin Maximus felt in the aftermath of 2018 2019 where they're just like stop adventuring out stop going to the frontier just stick with the thing you know is rebuilding to build our base we just go back to the core let's go back to the base ethis ultrasound money uh I bottom ticked it I thought about that I'll just remind people bottom so far I bought 8.97 during the Alameda crash or it's not the Alameda I bought 897 during the three hours Capital crash and then I bought 10.75 to add the Alameda FTX crash I actually think that like everyone's worried about contagion in the future yeah like I'm not one to call bottoms except so far uh the last one I'm calling bottoms with your windows three arrows cap when everyone was was freaking out about three hours Capital about oh there's gonna be so much more contagion in the future that was actually the moment to buy and that's what people are saying right now there's going to be so much more contagion we're gonna have to see the contagion uh uh see how bad the contagion is for Alameda and FTX that's when I bought uh and I'm I'm feeling good about it that's what I'm bullish on I'm still waiting for my triple digits to be honest but I may not get there you may not get there all right so if that's not what you're bullish on then what do you bullish on uh David I'm bankless I'm bullish on the bankless thesis I um you know I think it's just really struck me that um crypto has learned through 2022 that it can't leave its Destiny in the hands of of the banks of a bunch of centralized bankers and I think we veered into that it's just like there's something very easy about uh Solutions like FTX uh someone takes custody of your keys and the user experiences better there's no gas fees and it you know there's someone with a suit responsible for it willing to go in front of Congress there's there's something very settling about this right uh and and we did settle for it we settled for centralized exchanges and that's been the problem um but I feel like the bankless thesis has uh has held really strong like we have to rebuild the future of crypto not on uh centralized exchanges I mean like we could never build them on centralized exchange we have to rebuild the future on defy um so I I kind of feel pretty good about the bankless thesis coming out of this it's just like crypto banks are not going to solve our problems they're going to cause more problems it's interesting you know a lot of our conversation in the past few months before this debacle it's been about censorship resistance and that is one of the benefits of decentralization right censorship resistance and freedom and that's super important but here this was not a failure of like Sam was not censoring anyone's transactions right he was stealing the money okay like he was taking depositors funds and doing other things with them it was a trusted intermediary problem it was a banker problem we got screwed by the bankers Again David okay this is like 2008. this is like every sort of Banker crisis that we've seen where we've been screwed by the bankers this is why this is not a problem with D5 it's not a problem with ethereum like D5 didn't do this right D5 solves this problem and yet here we are in this place and this is why I understand your kind of your sadness and frustration part of this episode is just like didn't we already know this aren't we better than this aren't we supposed to be the ones who aren't trusting the sandbagman Freeds of the world uh so anyway I I do feel like the bankless thesis has has kind of held up even while crypto is suffering and we're probably going to rebuild this this entire space um on top of that thesis and this is why I am ultimately optimistic and bullish that we come out that we come out stronger and um I'm hopeful listener that if uh you've lost some money this week uh if you're affected by FTX um I'm sorry you know that that's really tough um we said in other times this has happened in the past take some time with family go for a jog clear your head take a break you step away for a bit we hope you come back because I think that um people in crypto need veterans with the type of experience that you've just received if you didn't have any funds in FTX you saw what happened to those around you and crypto needs people without experience this is how we make a stronger layer zero for next time because who's going to warn the class of 2025 or 2026 when they go do something stupid this is the only reason David and I know enough to kind of talk about this going bankless and about it's just because we we've seen it before and so one generation it's their responsibility to teach the Next Generation so you're developing your Battle Scars your veteran skills and um yeah we uh we need you here and we need you to push the bank list thesis forward yeah that's the cool thing about crypto is that it takes about three years to become a veteran uh there's not many Industries where like usually you need to be of 30 years in experience in something to be a veteran um but like this is how human wisdom is passed down from Villa Village Elders to the young folk and we actually have the privilege in crypto where it only takes three years to become like a village who can be wise because every year it's like 10 I feel like this week was like 10 years for me dude I'm exhausted I'm exhausted man I I haven't really been Dark Souls yeah all right let's end it with the meme of the week what are we looking at David meme of the week we are looking at FTX arena in Miami but it's actually a Spirit Halloween store oh my God because that's where that's where uh run down buildings go to die ah You Gotta Laugh read cry uh guys we hope you've enjoyed uh Bank list this week uh it's been a crazy week and we have a Moment of Zen for you so stick around for that but of course as always risks and disclaimers crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot last thing that I'll say is if you look at what precipitated some of the 2008 financial crisis you saw a number of bilateral bespoke non-reported uh transactions happening between Financial counterparties which then got repackaged and re-leveraged again and again and again such that no one knew how much risk was in that system until it all fell apart if you compare that to what happens on FTX or other major cryptocurrency venues today there is complete transparency about the full open interest there's complete transparency about the positions that are held there is a robust robust consistent risk framework applied and we're excited to work with the cftc on our U.S license and regulated venue hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to banklesshq right now to develop your crypto investing skills and learn how to free yourself from Banks and gain your
