[Music] thank you we're at the axillar interoperability summit we're right now I'm going to talk to Stephen goldfedter of Arboretum specifically about stylists this new thing that's creating what they are calling evm plus so if you want to code on solidity on arbitrum you still can but if you also want to code on arbitrum you can code with any other language that exists which I didn't know was possible but apparently it is now with arbitrum stylus but I also talked to him about the layer 2 Wars which are getting spicier and spicier these days especially as optimism's got their super chain ZK Sync has their hypers chain what does arbitrum have in their back pocket do they got something and Steven is going to come right back with his answer about that question right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023 why because Kraken has been around for over 12 years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry trusted centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable with over 9 million users and not a cent lost choosing crack second as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no-brainer we need exchanges like Kraken to provide the on-ramps to get people to go bankless and kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor if you're unsure about your centralized exchange or on-ramp perhaps open an account with Kraken today and if you're unsure about the rest of web 3 well then maybe you should get your learn on with metamask learn learning about crypto is hard there's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry until now metamask learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about web3 if you're a company trying to onboard employees or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your Boomer parents metamask learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons making learning about web3 fun and easy now once you're through kraken's Gates and you've taken the metamask course on what's a DEX you're safe to make your first stop into the world of D5 where better to start other than uniswap uniswap is of course a decentralized Exchange change for crypto asset trades and swaps but it's now also an nft aggregator as well making uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading Tech that's out there uniswap's a big announcement at East Denver is their uniswap wallet which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big old bully about crypto apps in the App Store uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem so if you want to use uniswap but with the cheapest possible fees then use uniswap on arbitrum the arbitrum layer 2 is the host of ethereum's most vibrant defy and nft communities arbitrary is already surpassing the East layer 1 in transaction volume and it's not even close to full capacity with so many vibrant communities on arbitrum arbitrim is a good place to call home for the era of layer twos speaking of settling into new homes the Phantom wallet is now available on both ethereum and polygon that's right the number one wallet on Solana is expanding into the ethereum ecosystem Phantom is the one wallet for everything displaying nfts making nft trades swapping tokens staking tokens so if you're a multi-chain surfer or an nft power user than the Phantom wallet is for you it also comes in Mobile check it out at phantom.app now let's get into the interview and we are still our interop Summit and I'm talking with Stephen goldfinter of arbitrum Stephen how's it going my man great great to be here uh you just came off of a panel what was that about uh the panel was about interoperability among Roll-Ups but you know that was the topic of the panel but also it of course had you know the roll-up teams talking about what they want to talk about so it was a fun panel which we discussed everything roll up some spice of interoperability yeah I'm sure the layer two Wars have we've been talking about the layer two Wars heating up for like 18 months now and now other people are also starting to say that so now you know it's really getting spicy these days guys always have it first yeah uh okay so the first thing I want to talk about is stylus because I kind of get it and I think it's a very big deal I'm pretty sure it's a very big deal but I'd like to hear it from you what is stylus and why is it such a big deal yeah so Stylus is our what we call evm plus and the idea is that arbitrim is and will always remain fully evm compatible or evm equivalent you might want to say but then the question we ask ourselves is can we do more can we be more inclusive like the evm is the starting point and a wonderful starting point but can we make affordances that are you know more inclusive and bring in more developers you know people always talk about they want the next billion users and my thesis is to get the next billion users we need the next million developers and how do we target to those and like always our goal is let's move to them rather than asking them to move to us so what stylist does is it says hey let's add additional language support alongside the evm which is why we call it evm plus to arbitrim so now you're not in the initial release of stylus you know the sky's the limit but the initial release will be able to not only write contracts in solidity or any other evm language but you'll be able to write contracts in Rust C and C plus plus and the coolest thing is that you can talk to each other in these contracts or you can even break your contract up and say I'm going to write that part in uh you know in solidity and that part in C plus plus or that part in Ross or use that rust library and by doing so you'll actually get a 10x besides for the developer experience and all that you'll get a 10x cost benefit as well so uh really exciting update for us okay so the the main the tldr is that developers no languages most developers don't know solidity but with stylists they can still write smart Contracting code using stylus exactly you know today it's very much a binary choice you might say I want to write contracts in roster you'll have to go to the chain that supports Frost or I might want to write contracts and move okay there are you know one or two chains that support move our goal is to say no no you want to choose the ecosystem you want to be on the language shouldn't be the determining Factor so you can build an arbit room if you want to be an arbitrum and you can use you know in the long term whatever language that you want to use and by the way it's also for solidity developers as well because they might say like hey I want to use this super you know cool cryptographic tool but it's just too expensive in the evm can I create my own pre-compile in Rust and do that and the answer with stylus would be yes you can so it's bringing in these new developers and giving tools and scalability options to the existing developers okay uh this my uh the answer to this question might get over my head but I'm going to ask anyways technically how does that work how does that like compile down to Smart contract byte code how does that work great question so the key Innovation here was with our launch of arbitrum nitro the way we do our fraud proofs change so it used to be we had something called the arbitrum virtual machine which was a custom virtual machine it's very similar to the evm optimized for proving and the on-chain proves were actually running that virtual machines code with with Nitro we got rid of all that and on chain we're actually running not our own VM but webassembly or Wasim which is like the VM of the internet all the web browsers use it so how do we get evm support we compile gef which is the go ethereum node the you know the popular ethereum node down to Wasim and what's actually happening on chain is we're not arguing about the evm directly we're arguing about the state of gaffe on this webassembly virtual machine so the cool thing is and I'm gonna gloss over the details but hopefully I'll give you the idea is you can now say we're not limited to gas any scene that can compile down to this underlying machine so if you have a Wasim compiler for your language and hey Ross C C plus plus almost every language does because Walzem is a very mature technology you can now um you know with some details run it on arbitrim as well okay I actually did follow most of that so awesome I'm kind of proud of myself on that one uh the not too long ago Arboretum recently acquired Prismatic uh Prismatic Labs was that Talent acquisition part of this story of Silas the Prismatic Labs is you know we're integrated very very well but fundamentally as a company we're very committed to continuing L1 development you know we're doing a ton of work for EIP 4844 and getting that ready and so their team is while it's very well integrated and we have a meeting of the minds and we talk about all ideas both ways their team is very focused on L1 priorities okay um and we work together again it's not exclusive so uh no this was not really this was already an effort by Arbitron prior to all that this was again so like that would Aqua higher if you will if that's the right word that wasn't really about the stylist uh project it wasn't about the stylist project but I don't want to actually limit like definitely like Raul and others on their team have contributed to stylus like there is that meaning of the minds but it wasn't like we're acquiring this Talent it was you know it was really an acquisition we wanted to develop prism and that's one of our ways that we say how do we contribute more to the ethereum community having a you know dedicated funding source for prison was important to us but also uh just the meaning of the minds right the conversations that happen between these teams is just uh incredible well yeah I remember talking about uh Raul and uh Preston uh about Silas and the the excitement just exuded from them in my chats with them so that was pretty cool and they had you know it's they did contribute a lot to the ideas behind it as well certainly and so like dude I'm gonna put my East Maxie hat on you talked about like there's the move language there's the rust language but now you're saying with stylist you can bring any language in does this kind of just like invalidate the idea of programming specific blockchain environments as in like now any developer from any ecosystem can come and build on arbitrum yes so this basically says any developer from any ecosystem again starting with these three additional languages but it will be more over time can develop an arbitrum and but the cool thing is the evm hell as it still has a critical role from our security this is happening on Layer Two what's securing us is the evml layer one so you know it's we're making the user experience better but the thing that's making this all possible is ethereum layer one the evm contracts we have and those are still written in evm okay very very cool so like I remember back in the day uh the Walzem Walzem was on the road map for the ethereum layer one I think it's since been jettisoned is this the layer two of ethereum starting to adopt some of the Innovation that was previously going to be on the layer one or is that a different story yes there was uh yeah it's got some really good memory there was this ewasm project um which was basically going after a very similar Vision that we have that we have today um for different reasons that project was abandoned but to the point I don't believe it was because like people I you know didn't want it or we're interested you're just you know these things are hard particularly on layer one and that's one of the things we have the ability to innovate on Layer Two in ways that you know in a system like ethereum are more difficult um so this is very much that same vision it's a bit harder to be honest on Layer Two because you have to make everything work with the fraud proofs sure um so just if you had you know layer one note it's a bit easier I'm not saying it's easier to get the consensus around it but it's easier to uh Implement and you know one thing which I think is possible with this feature and more generally I think layer twos can become uh sort of innovation grounds for layer one so if this turns out to be an off-desired feature on a heavily used feature there's nothing stopping ethereum from saying hey arbitrim has proved that they're proven that there's a good need for this and a good Community can we do this on layer one as well that's totally something that that's uh possible to happen and it wouldn't be a technical challenge it would be a community consensus challenge sure I want to Pivot the conversation a little bit to uh uh what I've discovered is like this new meta I've even been using the meta World quite a lot like all these interviews this interoperability conference it's all about abstraction layers between many many chains people are getting chain fatigue but abstraction layer solves that chain fatigue and this is something that optimism is really pushing forward with their super chain I know ZK Sync has their fractal scaling uh so optimism not super chain ZK Sync has fractal scaling does arbitrum have something like this in the same pipeline as are you guys going after that same effort so let me answer that question in two parts sure um yes we have and you know I'll link some Alpha here we'll probably be announcing the first one in a week or two we have um layer three chains that are coming to arbitrum that will have better interoperability than others but we don't have we're not branding that as a super chin or as an interoperability solution generally and let me explain why it's basically you know what you said in your question you know the optimism team you know says hey here's our super chain um you know it's for it's a way that all op stack chains can work together and you can add ZK proofs it's a nice Theory but there are so many strong builders in this case in the space there's us there is you know Metro ZK sync he mentions dark we're probably gone this is not something that one team can dictate you know even arbitrary you know we're in a very strong position we don't feel like we can dictate that we have to really get and work together because your point is like you know um optimism has their super chain uh ZK Sync has their hyper chain I think they're calling it now um you know star um polygon has uh you know their thing blockchains yeah and starkware will definitely let you know that they invented the term layer three too yes and and the point is you know we just end up with the same debate one step further right now it's artwork from optimism ZK sync and now it's no it's our interopolization right realization all right so we're not going to enter that space unilaterally what I want to do and you know I've been doing reach out and think it's important is to say hey all roll up teams let's think about not how we make a super chain of chains that build my technology how do we make a super chain of chains or whatever the term is or hyper chain or I don't think I'm agnostic change there you go how do we make one that integrates all of our Technologies and there's some serious technical challenges here but I think that can't be dictated by one team um and and that's not the approach we're going to go and I'd encourage others to really sit around the big table because otherwise we just have the same debate One Step Up the staff we're all arguing for our interoperable institutions and we haven't really gotten anywhere sure so again I feel like I'm about to ask a question that's gonna the answer is gonna be over my head how do all of these Layer Two Chains that have all of their training chainliness on top of them how do those technically all start to talk to each other to talk about that Vision you said so it's it's a really good question and and there are some you know a lot of these like super chain things they brush up over some of the technical details like one question is this shirt security question how do we really get shared security if there are different security models sure does it just evolve to the lowest security If you're sort of sharing a bridge um there are very hard questions and and to be honest I don't have all the answers but I think one thing which we can do is to start you know it's too early to standardize you know half these Technologies they're not even launched yet right um but I think we can start saying how do we build in a way that will make standardization easy in the future so I think it's really bad it's a conversation say we all want to work together because fundamentally the people that benefit we work together are the users and that's the ones we really want to serve so how do we you know put our own brand second and users first and say hey I might you know think your technology is terrible or I don't like you know it's ethereum so we're all a little more friendly than that but like fundamentally how do we work together and I think it's a very technical conversation and you know unlike some others I'm not coming here with an answer I'm coming here and saying we need to have that conversation sure uh Steven I think this is great is there anything else that I have not asked you about yet that is worth talking about um nothing else you know we're super excited to keep on building the arbor stream ecosystem I say nothing else then I start talking so that's great the arbitrary ecosystem is growing you know we're excited about uh you know particularly in D5 it also gaming um we are doing a ton of you know volume and a ton of value coming to the chain a ton of teams building on the Chain so for anyone out there watching um come building the arbitrum ecosystem we're excited to have you and come building ethereum that's the really the real goal here and we'll find the way whether you're an arboretum or not via a cross cross chain consensus to work together and make sure we can all build this future together Steven thank you so much thank you for having me cheers foreign
