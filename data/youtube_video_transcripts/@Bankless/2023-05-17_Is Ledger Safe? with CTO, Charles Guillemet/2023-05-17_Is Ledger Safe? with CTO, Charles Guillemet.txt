bankless Nation a special bonus episode for you today and I think an important one we have a ledger on the episode today the question in our minds are the private Keys safe we have the chief security officer of Ledger and we ask him that question along with a number of other questions related to this new recovery product that they just launched David uh who's on the episode today we have Charles guilla uh who we've actually recently had on the podcast he taught us how to properly spin up a private key so Charles does know a thing or two about Hardware wallets and and how to secure a private key and so today I think we actually learned quite a lot about what is actually under the hood of a hardware wallet and what is the fundamental nature of a hardware wallet I think this is a conversation that the entire industry is working through right now and I think this this episode will be very very useful to understand exactly the topics of discussion that we are having both in public and on this episode before we get there though we're going to talk about our friends and sponsor at consensus because they have a brand new product this one's for all the devs out there a cool new code auditing tool with a sick new name diligence fuzzing ever thought about that Ryan diligence no for smart contract solidity devs Auditors and Enterprises who are engaging in web3 that need to ensure their smart contracts are secure before proceeding to mainnet diligence fuzzing it's an audit grade security tool that serves for the most automated way to test code and find vulnerabilities without having to host their own infrastructure is just you just try all this you try to try to break it basically that's what fuzzy yes yeah so the idea is what is fuzzing you set some parameters that are incorrect and correct as it outputs and then you throw an infinite number of numbers in as inputs and if there ever comes out as an invalid you can kind of test it that's my non-devy way of explaining this people who needed to have fuzzing explain to them did not need this product these are for this one's for the devs uh so diligence fuzzing is just an extra layer of protection for your smart contracts in addition to and Beyond typical code audits there is a link in the show notes to get started uh if you want to get started doing your diligence fuzzing by robots well you know what we're going to do some Ledger fuzzing right now because we are Ledger fuzzing yeah and so uh we are recording this intro after we've already done the episode with Charles from Ledger and so I think it was a fan fantastic episode myself I'm really interested to hear what the community thinks this is an education episode we ask I think some difficult questions of Charles at Ledger and he gives his respect I do feel like we did get down to the bottom of it like we got down to the root of the problem and I personally feel like I have closure in yes I would say understanding what the security posture of this Hardware device that I own called a ledger understanding what that actually is I feel like after this episode I understand it much more now it'll be up to bankless listeners to decide whether that is the security posture they they want to move forward with and continue using but yeah this is a successful episode from that perspective to me one small disclosure Ledger is a previous banquet sponsor they are not a current bank list sponsor and with that let's go ahead and get right into the episode so we can learn exactly how a hardware wallet works with Charles from Ledger but

cryptography and Hardware security sector Charles welcome back to bankless hi David thanks for having me so just want to dive right into the the subject at hand here uh the context as I understand it and we're coming into this episode very very quickly so I'm going to give you an opportunity to correct this context if I get this wrong um yesterday Ledger launched its recover service that lets users back up their private keys so that it could be recovered If lost this recover service splits up private Keys into three different encrypted shards sent out from the device to be held separately by three different custodians also perhaps including Ledger the strategy here is that we know in crypto that private keys are a huge hurdle for adoption and many people just don't want to manage their own private keys and Ledger recover is meant to be a solution let the professionals do the professional thing and manage your private keys on your behalf is an opt-in service but this opt-in service is not exactly the source of the outrage coming from the crypto World Ledger users previously thought that it was impossible for private keys to ever leave their existing Ledger devices as is this is the point of a hardware wallet after all so now Ledger has released this firmware update that seems to make this possible albeit in a highly secure encrypted and sharded fashion the point remains that something that was once thought impossible is now actually learned to be possible and has possibly been possible this entire time uh so Charles is this an accurate summary somebody from your perspective and what would you add yeah I think part of the feedback we got from the community were about this this part but there was also uh like some misunderstanding around the feature what it does why we want to release this and so on and maybe I can start with that like the the intent of um this feature is to bring more people to uh secure self-custody because when you zoom out we are in in the little bubble uh like uh tech savvy people but when you zoom out today most crypto owners are using exchanges uh to customize their assets or are using software wallets and the reality is that self-custody seems a little bit complex maybe is a little bit complex for newcomers and and people can be afraid of it and for me there are two major fiction points in circuit in the self-castity journey and I often think about my mother it's too complex like self is too complex for her because I see two major friction points and the first one is the understanding and management of Securities like these things are quite complex if you are not used to to know what is the secretary and so on it's complex I mean you mean I have to write down this 20 24 words what do I do with these words and so on when you are not tech savvy this thing can be fighting and the second thing is like understanding what you sign and consent there are there's exhibitional advices all the stuff when you do smart contract interaction it can be a little bit complex so for me there's two major friction points needs to be addressed by Ledger and we need to to find a way for newcomers for for mass in order to enable mass adoption and in self-custody I think there are different Shades of Gray different level level of trust the x2m left you have like a full trustless model where you don't trust anyone you build your own computer you your own operating system your own wallet you and so on you generate your own secrets you manage your your backup you build the tools to synchronize the blockchain inside like this would be the extreme 2s less model very difficult to achieve and quite it needs a lot of skills time and so on and they are at the extreme white you have like the the custodian model where people are completely trusting a third party to manage their assets and in between you have like different shade of gray and you have software wallets which are not secured and but a little bit more in self-care Stadium you are in self-case really with software and you have Hardware wallets which are for me the best option so far but when you use software there is some level of trust you have to put into the wallet manufacturer whether it is called card freezer or or Ledger you have to trust a little bit as you have to trust a little bit our vendor because we all so depend on different vendors mostly for for the hardware itself we are buying this the circuit so yes the intent of this feature is to remove this friction hurdles for these people leaving the assets on exchanges and get one step closer to uh self self strategy and self-surgery so when you use this feature I agree you are doing a small trade-off where you are saying I'm not completely self-servain I I'm not the only one able to to uh to manage my backup but the trade-off I think is acceptable because the the seed is splitted with uh in in two different shards so there is no one custodian that these are like part of the backup provider providers they don't consider your seed because cryptographically speaking they don't have access to your scene This Is A Shard and With A Shard which is encrypted for security reason but with a shot you that you don't have any information about the secret you have to to have at least two other the three shards in order to be able to be combined a secret and and know the the wallet content and and use it so this is this is the the trailer if you have and also yes um uh in in this uh in yesterday in this uh in this episode like I noticed that some people not everyone but some people were a little bit uh starting to understand like how her Hardware will it works and um and they were a little bit surprised to understand that the the firmware or the software running inside the security element is something that can be changed is something that have an access to uh to the secret but from a secret standpoint like nothing really changes really like the seed is still generated within the secure element the cryptographic operation are implemented within the secure element like so that the seed doesn't have to leave the device when you use your crypto and there is this trusted display allowing you to a consent for any any operation and this part is really really important and it never change and as soon as the operating system will touch will touch a secret on your device it will ask you for consent whether it is like for a signing Bitcoin transaction doing a smart contract interaction stating on like Cosmos chain or any other chain doing firmware update downloading an app or use a ledger recovery service for all there's a variant desperation and there are many other operations for all this operation the operating system needs to have an access to the secret to the seed in order to do some cryptographic operation on it and as soon as this happens like the user is prompted and the user asked to a consent for this operation if the user is isn't happy with doing is simply Decline and that's it there was nothing happened is the user is not happy with the current bitcoin transaction EEG clients and that's it there is nothing happens so we we really must have this part in mind that of course the operating stem as an access to the cryptographic materials to the secret but as soon as an operation involved this this secret the user is prompted and his consent is requested so this is this is really the security model and also there is a something which was a little bit weird for for some people like this the ability for the firmware to be updated and this part is really important this environment where security is not something static security is a journey like you it's impossible to say okay I build a hardware that I put uh some like firmware and so on and that's it I won't ever be able to change anything like everything is uh is engraved in the marble and I can't change anything if you do that your product won't be secure for for a long time because like as I said like security is a journey you always have to improve security to raise the bar for for security so we are doing quite often upgrades in order to add new features because as you probably know there are there are plenty of new features in the blockchain equals 10 new blockchain to support means new cryptography to implement new features on ECM blockchain means like a specific fixed report in the ethereum app or in the operating system like for instance we we have to support BLS just for the deposit contract for ethereum in order to to interact with uh with the blockchain and for that that means we we need to do a thermal upgrade and upgrade the operating system in order to provide this this feature also we are we are integrating these days like the ens integration within the device that means you will be able to send directly etm to vitalik.es if you want to send to send them to send Em some some ECM and on the device you will have this resolution and this requires some like operating system upgrade and geographic system needs to to access to the to the security so yeah the the this is uh this was a little bit long but I I want to to give more more color to all of this and frankly I I learned two things yesterday the the first thing is like the community cares a lot about about Legend when you have this kind of reaction that means like things are important Ledger is important for for the ecosystem and frankly this is this is touching for me for for us at Ledger and the second the second thing is like we we could have done a better job at explaining how all of this work because that was not completely clear for everyone yeah I would definitely Echo um both of those points that um your people care so much about Ledger because this is sort of a we all have one we've been Ledger users Forever on the bankless journey I mean this is the non-custodial Hardware wallet that um we recommend that um that you know the community has has largely adopted so so we we all very much care and yeah I would Echo that um man the comms around this uh was was real rough and of course like Twitter can get into all sorts of um they can mob attack they can Pitchfork um and uh yeah I do think this will be a learning lesson for Ledger moving forward and how to explain this but um you've uncovered so many you've talked about so many things Charles I feel like we need to kind of double back and get to and get to sort of the first section of this and I do want in a little bit uh for David and myself to pull up a visual of kind of like the the hardware itself so that people don't leave this podcast episode without understanding the inside of how their Ledger device might be working but before we get there the main concern on people's minds you talked about um two different kind of uh user personas I think ledgers is maybe appealing to one is sort of the you know the crypto OG the non-custodial maximalist side and you know they're they're a few very few that you know bought buy a brand new hardware laptop from uh from Best Buy or something like and like set it up from scratch right but there are a lot of people who depend on ledger to be sort of their their uh non-custodial crypto wallet where the private keys don't leave that particular device and that's that's a lot of people on the bank list Journey right now and then there is a larger set of users that finds it very difficult my my parents would be one of these for for instance they would find it very difficult to actually set up a you know a hardware a wallet in Ledger and store those seed that seed phrase in a safe location and what what Ledger is saying hey we want to appeal to that audience too and we want to have a um a product for them and so there's this bifurcation right and what I think some of the the OG users are worried about is is that ledger has forgotten about them somehow and so one core question I have for you and I want to make sure that people are clear on this this recover service that we talked about that is that is more for people who want to Veer on the Spectrum more towards a little bit more custody rather than than self-custody is this opt-in or is this forced is this forced on everyone with a ledger device with a firmware update or can they say no can they do they have to re and if they can say no how do they say no do they just not download the firmware is there a box you can check is are is there a forked version of the software let's make sure we understand this first yeah if you don't like the service you you don't even have to to say no it's the opposite if you want the service you you have to subscribe you have to create an account you have to go through the identity identity verification process because this service works with identity verification and if you don't do that like nothing happens like you don't subscribe to the service and nothing happened to your scene like it stays on your device little secure and that's it so of course it's optional completely optional if you don't like the this ID like don't do anything you can upgrade your firmware you can graduate your life nothing will happen so if I upgrade my firmware this doesn't introduce some sort of difference this doesn't introduce some sort of back door this doesn't introduce some sort of way for Ledger through a software update to uh you know extract out my private Keys is that is what is different about this firmware upgrade versus previous firmware upgrade so anyone who's had a ledger for any number of years has obviously upgraded their their firmware why for security updates um because they want additional support more features more compsy right it's like no one has the original version of The Well very few have the original version of The Ledger software but what people are worried about is this new firmware update might um degrade the the security posture that ledger has had on the the firmware device so far can you can you talk about that no so in short no it doesn't degrade the security posture of of Ledger of of anything in in this area as I mentioned like it adds a new functionality that you can choose to use or not use but geopoliting system like before disability the operating system has a full access to your secret and as soon as you want to use the secret you have to consent after this upgrade this is the this is the same thing the operating system is still full access to your seed and as soon as like something touches uh your secret you have to consent there is just a new feature a new possibility for like recover to to be activated and to be used and if you want to use it like you will have to consent on the device like do you want to initially initialize a ledger recover backup phase and and then you will have to uh to follow the the plan on the device and and the full process will happen so this this is this is this there is this piece of of code inside Geographic stem on top of what existing before what was existing before but the same way we are adding new application and new feature you don't have to use them like it's there you if you don't like Bitcoin you just don't uh install the Bitcoin application you don't you don't say transaction and that's it in in this case if you don't like this service you simply don't have to use it it's the same and so I think at this point in this conversation we need to unpack the guts of what makes a ledger a ledger uh and so I think this uh visual uh that I believe hasib made from scratch uh is is pretty useful here and so I I think listeners should just view a ledger as two boxes one box inside of a bigger box the bigger box is your Ledger the actual device and inside of that ledger is this secure element and that is the thing that houses the private key and so the outside box is like the computer the device the chip that manages the secure element and then the secure element has the private key and that is like the Fort Knox of your Ledger and I think why the the answer to the question why is everyone so upset right now is that people previously thought that the secure element it's impossible for private keys to leave the secure element that is the purpose of the secure element and that is the design that whatever that people talk about the hardware walls I say like yeah you get a hardware wallet because humans are messy and Hardware walls have one job which is to not allow your private keys to leave the hardware wallet and Charles what you're saying is that that is still true because you can sign a signature you can like prove a message on your Ledger that requires human input to ever allow for private keys to leave the to for a signature to be signed but what's different here in this new firmware update is that people are now understanding that that secure element also has software in it and firmware can update the software of the sick of the secure elements and with this new firmware update the software inside of the secure element is able to be updated in a way that can allow for the seed the private keys to be escape to escape from the hardware wallet if you physically approve the hardware wall if it's in your hands and you hit the little check box that says approved but it can now do that and this product that ledger is making is the uh as soon as you approve that it charges it into three different charts it encrypts each one twice sends it to different custodians of the world probably the most secure way to secure a seed phrase but people are now understanding that the secure element is actually software not hardware and this has caused people's concern is it is this a good summary I I think it's it's a good summary of the misunderstanding what you need to understand like the secure element is is a circuit is the circuit with low low capacity processing but this part is true with some uh crypto accelerator that means that there are piece of Hardware that can accelerate the cryptographic operation but when I say when I refer to Ledger operating system like this part is software it's firmware and this part is implemented inside the secure element like it's possible for the keys to not leave the secure element even if even when you are doing a signature because the operating system inside the secure element has access to the Keys and can be upgraded like I mean when when we added when we had the support for BLS on on for SEO for instance that means that we have to add a new feature in the operating system so we are writing the code for lbls support and then we are upgrading our operating system so that now it's reported jss and this operating system runs inside the secure element when you think um secure element like search elements is a small computer like there is a small MCU there is a dedicated ROM there is a dedicated flash uh there is a crypto accelerator and there are different uh peripherals in order to communicate with the rest of the world this is what a secure element is and this equipment needs to run some code like this is not like something magic and this code is the one we we wrote and for years now this is an operating system so we load our own operating system there is an attestation mechanism there was some there are some Integrity checks in order to make sure that this is our code that runs inside and not another there is uh there is the Jetta station allows to do this firmware upgrade over the air securely because when you do with some upgrade we want to make sure that the firmware comes from us and then there is the old like secure Channel attestation at Ledger we have different checks and control so that when you when we do operating system upgrade we need this upgrade needs to be signed so we have a multi-signature process within a ledger so that to make sure that this new operating system version does not introduce like back doors or or bugs and so on but disappointing stem rents inside the secure element and this is the same with your Bitcoin application or ethereum application when you load your ECR navigation it's loaded inside the secure element and it runs on top of the operating system like if if you think like like a computer like the Nano is like the search element is your computer and the inside the the second there is a flash which which would be your hard drive there is there is one exactly as in your computer there is an operating system like Linux but it's really small really smaller and and very few features it's mostly cryptographic and security oriented and you can run apps like any app on on Linux and and there the apps are Bitcoin ECM and others this is the app that are running inside so it's like it's a metaphor it's a comparison but I think it's quite it's quite a fair one if because what I realized that was some some people was thinking that there was some magic like the the seed is inside the secure element and we can add new features without this feature touching the the secret no it can't it can't work like that like that the cryptography signature encryption everything related to the use of your assets needs to access to your seed and and as soon as we add new features we upgrade this code so that it can do it can it can do new things but again with your consent always this is the this thing never changed sure and so I I would imagine I'm from The Ledger perspective uh understanding how a ledger works you this update is released and then from your from The Ledger perspective everyone is up in arms it's like oh you can update the secure enclave and you guys are like yeah we've been doing that this entire time that's what that's what that's what firmware updates are what you guys think was going on but then from our perspective it's like it's uh it's specifically the nature of this update that has opened up some doors as to like what could happen in the future and so like there's two doors that have opened which is okay now Ledger has made a product that opens up access to private keys on an opt-in basis but what is down what is down that road like how easy does that get like there's now an API that goes to my private keys that is an opt-in basis but it raises concerns about like okay well what if a nation state comes and starts to twist Ledger's arm and what happens if in one or two or five years the doors to accessing my private keys are much larger than they are now and then also now there's an additional attack Vector which I technically has always existed but now we are more aware of it is there's just one Rogue firmware update away from uh a a rope firmware update that would make accessing private Keys uh trivial and so now we are all understanding that uh if Ledger is compromised or some firmware update is compromised that that could be a Black Swan event if you will because everyone's Ledger is compromised if we all download this new rogue firmware so that's a new security Vector which I'm guessing again it's our has always been there but now we're aware of it um do you have any thoughts or Reflections on these concerns yeah you're completely true and it's it's true for every wallet whether they are software or Hardware when they are Hardware it's a little bit more complex because you have to upgrade the firmware and then you need some collaboration between like Ledger live or the software interfacing with the hardware but yeah you you're totally true and this is the level of trust that I wear I was mentioning before when you use Ledger there was there was some level of choice that you need to put into Ledger uh so that we don't do a very nasty thing and if you don't want to uh to have any test as I said it's it's really really complex there was it's always a trailer between the trust security and self-certainty and it's yeah it's it's impossible to to be completely trustless you would need you would need to be to build your own computer because if you want to be trustless you can you can trust your own computer and then you would need to build the software when you go on top of it but when we're building software you need a compiler so how do you trust the compiler you you're going to you you would need to build the entire stack that the the overall electronic and software industry have been built during 50 years so what I want to say it's impossible for one one human to be completely trustless in this process and then the the it's a matter of trade-off like where do you put the cursor or of i2s this guy for managing and providing me the right tools and I'm completely self-servient and this cursor are plenty of different shades of Shades of Gray and as you as you mentioned I think like some people realize that they're well they were they were trusting Ledger a little bit more than they thought and I think this is this is what happens yesterday learning about crypto is hard until now

app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free I'm reminded of a metaphor that was used when uh actually remember this pretty clearly vitalik was on the Eric Weinstein's podcast s and they were talking about the 2016 ethereum Dow hack and the social contract of ethereum at the time was completely autonomous robots only don't trust the humans and then the Dow hack happened and then it was like this it was a robot and you rip the mask off the robot and there's a human there and I think this is the the same thing that's currently happening with Ledger as everyone thought it's like oh it's completely Hardware you don't have to trust humans uh the hardware has got you that's the whole point of the of a hardware wallet and now with this understanding about like what a firmware update means and how deep a firmware update goes people are now realizing that oh it's a human there it's Ledger which is a company of people that is Incorporated in France that has Founders in leadership and so now I think the crypto world is now coming to terms with that and is now going to ask Ledger the company to make a very strong social contract to the crypto industry to the crypto Believers the the crypto hardliners if you will which are causing this uproar about how are you with now that this new attack Vector is opened up this Canada the Genies out of the bottle how are you guys going to sign a social contract on our behalf and is that even possible I think that is kind of the question that everyone's learning how to ask right now including myself yes it's a good one I think like the the social contract uh is is what they said before as soon as like the software the firmware is touching your secret like it's up to your consent there is a always you need to authenticate yourself always the everything starts with the pin and after the pin like as soon as something touch your secret uh to do like sensitive operation I'm not saying uh generating a public key you you have to launch the to launch the ethereum app first but yeah but for everything related to using private keys and so on you are always prompted and you you need to consent for that and this contract never changed and at some point you you need to trust us for not pushing back those and for this there is there is no real choice and it's always the case for every single wallet vendors whether it is it is a hardware or even software what's interesting so I okay so I I'm hearing this loud and clear there's really like two levels of consent on the device before you know allowing this and that's just on the device allowing this kind of Recovery Service one is you update the firmware right so there could be a swath of people listening to this thing I you know I'm not going to update the firmware and that if so that's your choice you you bought the hardware advice you don't have to update the firmware if you don't want to but look at this it's a bad idea it's a bad idea let me get back to that but it's like so that that is the first thing you have to do a second thing is um uh there's actual physical approval from uh Ledger if you want to if anytime it's going to act uh touch your secret and so opt you like get you into the recovery service there's something you have to actually click approve on your Ledger device so there's kind of two layers here now getting back to it's a bad idea right to not update your firmware that this is kind of the trade-off Spectrum I think people had like how oh to bankless sister I guess and to myself I'm asking you this question how certain am I that the existing firmware version on my ledger device doesn't have a security flaw in it like I don't know I mean this is part of what um a company like Ledger I imagine provides is when you identify any sort of security flaw or some sort of issue you kind of patch that you you fix the bug and you require or you ask for a firmware update from all of your users right so that's kind of an unknown for me in addition to like the whole world of all of the features that I might want in the future for my ledger device so that's kind of a choice you have to make it's like how secure is your existing the existing version of of your firmware you really don't know and what if a flaw is uncovered who do you kind of trust to um to patch that up uh so that that is kind of trade out but you wanted to say something here Charles yeah what I wanted to say is it's a bad idea to not update your your firmware because in firmware update they are they are always secretary improvements some sometimes it's even a vulnerability fixed there was and we are completely transparent about that you can go on dungeon.ajar.com LSB for Ledger security Builder and every every time we we uncover a new vulnerability whether it is our teams or external teams we are first fixing them and then we are we are publishing the logistic attributor and and to be completely transparent like a few days weeks ago we we have we have found something quite interesting on the implementation of minuscript we are we are among the the only one supporting World manuscript and there was a team integrating like this mini script implementation and they found something uh something quite interesting a vulnerability so we worked with them we fixed the vulnerability and if your Bitcoin app is up to date you your disability is fixed if you're not now the attacker knows the veneability because now it's public and you are vulnerable so that's why it's really important to um to to always uh update your firmware and and the application this is such a hard situation for for I think users who want to be completely Bank listen and self-sovereign to to be in because we have to sort of make it a choice we have to and I I guess maybe the question goes to like David is pointing to sort of the social contract that ledger can make um to say we believe in self-custody um you know we we can we believe in uh you know kind of transparency we um are going to do our best to kind of protect your device at all times and keep your private keys in the secure enclave and only ask your permission if if you know something changes but um I I'm wondering if we can even get stronger on because crypto is very much in industry history of like don't trust but verify right and so like is there a way that crypto a listener can have assurances that ledger hasn't introduced some sort of back door like can we open source this is is that not a Avenue is there is there some way to guarantee this I mean I don't even want to rely on like third-party Auditors here but you see what I'm saying it's just like um how can we be sure that a future Ledger firmware update does not introduce some sort of a back door right because you know Ledger is now a large company I'm I'm sure there are authorities I'm sure there are nation states who uh somewhere on the planet would like to introduce some sort of back door into a future for firmware update and um yeah how can we verify that this indeed hasn't happened do we just have to basically trust at the social contract layer that you haven't done that so first I'm gonna start with the social contract and again we we are pro self-custody like this is this is the purpose of Ledger we would like that everyone to be completely uh self-server and completely in self-custody and as I mentioned like in this journey there are different Shades of Gray and and there are the reality is that today we are very few in Circus okay yeah I'm it's important for me it's important for you but at the end this what's what is this part of the crypto request and most of people are using Robinhood by uh Bitcoin or are leaving their Bitcoin on an exchange this is the situation the situation right now so how can we make sure that these people come a little bit closer to self-castell and I think this kind of feature goes in that direction I would love that everyone understands very well that's self-custody is the purpose of production Revolution this is something I say like every time I I I can speak but the reality is that's not the case right now most people are using Bitcoin as it as as they were speculating on stocks this is not the purpose of like crypto ECM or Bitcoin the the purpose is self-custody you have to own your own value to be permissionless to be as trustless as possible I I am completely aware of this Ledger is aware of this this is the ethos of the company now how can we bring these people into self-custody and I think this feature is part of this like so the social contract is We are continuing our world to empower people to give them the right tools to be in circularly to really own their value this is what we do this does not change and about your comment about a state forcing us to put back doors and so on yeah I what can I answer to that this this is always true for for everyone like yeah okay that was that was true yesterday this will be true tomorrow uh and it's difficult to prove the absence absence of of any backdoor um about open sourcing our operating system this is uh this is a like a very um a long story like we are talking about that at Ledger we are talking about that every everywhere we can a lot of people are asking us to uh to open source our operating system I would love to the problem is we are using secure element secure element is like the best device you can you can imagine to implement cryptography to store secrets and so on this is why we are using secure element but when you are using secure element you sign an NGA with the secure element providers and the securement provider simply like prevent you to uh to to give any information about how their security secretary secure element is working because there is the ipe because there are plenty of of proprietary security countermeasure and they don't want these things to be uh to be public so we simply can't publish our operation operating system source code because of this and I think the something which is really interesting in open source is the capacity for everyone to audit the code but does it does not guarantee that people will audit the code and this is this is a big blind spot uh in in in the ecosystem a lot of code are open source but no energy them and no one pays for audit and it does not happen okay our source code is not open source at least the operating system the applications are you can you can you can audit them if if you want but the operating system is not because of what I just said nonetheless like we are internally auditing and we have one of the best team in the in the world in terms of security the dungeon they are uncovering security flaws like in in many different implementation in hours also sometimes and then we are improving things we are also using third party to um to to audit our code we are all also getting through a security certification like so that you are you are the third party that goes through a complete audit of your product code and so on to make sure uh it's uh it's not possible to uh to go through the to to uh yeah to to to bypass the security feature and this is this is what we do but for for Hardware especially for Hardware because open source is especially interesting when it comes to software like you you have you use a specific uh version of a software and then this software is open source what you will do is uh clone the GitHub repository you will compile it and then you can compare this to the the binary that is distributed you can even run the version that you compile yourself not a lot of people are doing this but this is something you can but with hardware and with firmware it's very difficult to have guarantees that the software which is running inside the hardware that is the the same that is that is being distributed by the vendor so even if we were open source completely open source you would have like very large difficulty to make sure that the the operating system running in the device is the same that you downloaded and it's the same problem with code cards the same problem with with tweezer you you don't have got it by the way Teresa recently they uh they they got some people Distributing like fake Twitter devices like with back door inside and as there is no integrate Integra Integrity mechanism there is no way for people to distinguish a real treasure from a fake one because everything is the same and and you have no way to make to be sure that the version which is inside the twizzle is a white one or a fake one you have with with Hardware with it with Hardware engineer uh Charles you said um we need Innovations like Ledger recover to be able to onboard like the robin hoods of the word the very very banked people of the world stuff like this can make them more bankless uh and uh that's one half of me is like absolutely let's let's get the rest of the world into the world of of sovereign private keys and then the other half of me is like don't compromise on my Fort Knox in my hand in my Hardware wallet just because some Robin Hood Bros want to come into crypto and so like there's there's like two there's like two sides that I can see here there's like yeah we need more people to come into crypto let's make it easier for them but also don't compromise on like how strong I can be self-sovereign and so the the one topic of conversation that's been floating around in my circles about this has been like well can't there just be two firmwares one is like the Robin Hood uh Robin Hood bro people that want to come in and uh and want to be get their first Hardware wallet in a way that feels good and then can there be a second firmware which is like the Fort Knox for the crypto extremists who want the maximum level of security so that I I'll raise that but also I think I think the point that we're learning here is that even if you do make the Fort Knox version if you do like split the uh split the form Wars into two past like the hardcore and the easy modes that it's actually kind of uh Superfluous as in like it's the same risk risk vectors either way and that's perhaps like kind of the frustration of Ledger is like sure you can have your Fort Knox version of the firmware but like you actually aren't reducing any of the the cuts because anytime you you do a firmware update it just kind of you reset it's the same thing yeah uh and so like this is that kind of like I see the Rock and the hard place that that ledger is in um but I'll float the idea of like a second firmware of Fort Knox firmware that will just make people feel good and maybe that's a maybe that's something see it's it's an idea but again I don't I don't think it resolve your uh your concern in all cases you will have to trust Ledger a little bit right being completely trustless as I mentioned is something really difficult you would have to to build the entire stack from scratch and and this is this has got to be true for for our all Hardware wallets right just our Hardware wallets as a vertical this is going to be true or even softer over it right yeah it's the same there was there was a there was a part of of trust inside of course so I think this is kind of just a learning moment for the entire industry as to how how a hardware wallet works yeah and frankly I'm a bit disappointed because I I thought I did a hard work explaining how all of this works and so on but if it was not here for everyone now it's a little bit better sometimes it takes these events uh Charles so that um you know the the information education can can really propagate so I I'm curious that as you as you zoom out on this on this whole thing um what is kind of the The Learning lesson for uh Ledger about this um event uh or this discussion over the last couple of days and then what do you think is the the learning uh the takeaway for the rest of crypto um so one of the first takeaway is like in terms of communication things could have been really better the thing is we planned to announce it like officially with explaining everything and so on we we had the solid communication plan for uh for a little bit earlier um for a little bit later the the thing is when we uh we we want it to be ready when we launched to be able for users to upgrade the firmware so we needed to distribute the firmware beforehand and as we are transparent in the release note we explained that this new VMware contain the the capability to to activate the jaw recover and the thing is instead of bring bringing to the crypto ecosystem this new idea how it works and if you don't like it you don't have to use it this is the community that discovered the functionality and and started to speculate oh they are extracting my seed and so on like a lot of threads started and we instead of for us to explain the feature the GID the intent the fact that it does not change anything in terms of security model and and the user contract with with Ledger instead of being in that situation we spent like 24 hours explaining that no we are not installing any kind of backdoor and by the way you didn't completely understand how Hardware wallet works so yeah this is so in terms of communication like the point taken of course things could have been better the second takeaway for me is I as I mentioned the the crypto community ecosystem cares a lot about Ledger frankly when you see this kind of passions kind of even if it's not positive passion this means this means a lot for me this is touching and and yeah the the message has been received the third takeaway is as I mentioned like we we could have explained better what the security model was the how however when it works and so on I feel we we spend a lot of time like explaining these things again and again probably that was not enough of course and and sometimes I mean the company for more than five years and sometimes I feel I explained this like 10 times but what what I explained in 2017 I explained it to like one percent of the people who are in the community right now so this is a this is something and people forget Charles you know yes people forget yeah of course I'm not always thinking about how the inside of my ledger works right yeah that's that's true so yeah so this is a never-ending uh story we we need to continue uh doing this effort explaining well uh what's the what's the trade-off when you use a ledger because it's always a matter of trade-off there was no like perfectly trustless secure um and um and self-serving uh solution this thing does not happen that does not exist you it's it's always a matter of of trade-off I think the trade-off that ledger is providing has a lot of value as a customer as a user I love I love this the value provided provided by Ledger and and then I would like that there's Robin Hood people to get a little bit of this of this value and this this is the intent of the of The Ledger recover um and yeah again also we are in the Twitter equal chamber and Twitter is not really the real world let's keep this in mind this is not available I think we've all learned a lot of the last couple of days and and certainly I hope bankless listeners having this episode but I I want to ask this kind of uh final question and this we've been talking about a new cohort of users that that ledger wants to get kind of the you know the Robin Hood crowd the people who are not comfortable with the hardware wallet and their seed phrase um as is and I think some of the ogs part of this you know this passion you've seen comes from an emotional place and what they're saying Charles is uh you guys aren't going to forget about us are you like oh no no we won't I'm part of this guys I'm I'm our voice is at Ledger so so tell me about that because I think that's where this is coming from there are a lot of people who started their Bank list Journey with a hardware wallet and and use Ledger and the reason they did that is for maximum self sovereignty and they want to feel like the company whose product they own supports them on that journey and hasn't changed and Ledger has grown a lot over the last few years um certainly a new uh round of funding as well the team size has grown and I think some of the ogs are basically saying hey Ledger you're not going to forget why you're here you're not going to forget about this Mission and the reason I know that is because um they ask bankless the exact same questions right bankless has also grown and they are continually asking us hey do you guys still remember why you're here like the mission like the reason we're doing this thing and I think they are now through this episode in an impassioned way in a pitchfork way in a Twitter mob attack type way but also in a good way they're asking Ledger why are you still here do you know do you know the mission you haven't forgotten about us have you so what would you say to that yeah I think I mentioned at this point already but I'm very happy to to say it again like the mission of Ledger is to provide the users with tools to be on board to be in self-custody in in in self-serventory because this is the purpose of like the blockchain revolution the purpose is not about like speculating speculating about with Bitcoin as you would speculate with stocks frankly this this thing is not interesting I am from my standpoint and and by the way this is definitely not the mission of Ledger like the mission is to provide uh our you our users with tools to own their value to use it securely and to be completely self-suffering and the thing is that in this Mission if you only talk to like core hard uh hardcore user that uh or that understands this very uh very well uh you you you are completely blind to to a big world who would like to enter this world and this is also what we what we are doing we are not forgetting the ethos like this this um doesn't change we are just trying to make sure that everyone every the mass adoption will understand this ethos we won't make to make sure they understand and and we're moving a little bit the friction point for them uh to to enter into self-custody and self-serventy because again this is really the the purpose of of Bitcoin of ethereum of blockchain in general and and personally speaking this is also what motivates me to to be at leisure I truly believe in in this Mission and I I don't feel there is another player in the crypto ecosystem which is such committed to uh to self-custody and self-sometry so this does not change but we also have to keep in mind that the OG of like 2014 or 2017 uh only a small portion of the ocean of crypto users today and we have to talk to everyone we don't forget Doogie but we we we we have to to talk to everyone and by the way frankly sometimes I'm a little bit disappointed by the OG Community we we are investing a lot on supporting plenty of Bitcoin features and and same with ethereum and at the end when we have a look to the start not much people are using it using them so there is this this thing which is a little bit disappointing for me and like we are investing a lot to to make sure that this OG population has the right tools and so on and at the end they don't use them so much so but we won't stop I'm just saying that that's a good point to end it with and the reason I asked again is because I just wanted to hear it one more time uh from your mouth Charles thank you so much for engaging the community in this way in podcast form I think discussions are much easier than Twitter battles back and forth and we appreciate you taking the time to to come on and explain this today yeah thank you for giving me the opportunity that was a really good discussion open discussion and yeah I'll be happy to to have participated awesome bankless Nation I've written disclaimers of course none of this has been Financial advice you know it wasn't because you're listening to bank lists I gotta let you know again a reminder in case you needed reminding Bitcoin if these assets are risky so is D5 you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot thank you
