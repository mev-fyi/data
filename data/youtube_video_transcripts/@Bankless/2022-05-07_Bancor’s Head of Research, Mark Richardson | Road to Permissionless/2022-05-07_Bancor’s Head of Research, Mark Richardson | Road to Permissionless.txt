[Music] hey bankless nation welcome to a special episode series we're doing called the road to permission list because david we are on the road to d5's largest conference ever this is the permissionless conference it is happening may 17th to 19th so this is an episode where we hypes and the companies and projects that are coming with us two permissionless they are on the road right now david there's some really great speakers coming to permissionless uh folks if you don't have your tickets this is what you're missing out on uh tell them some of the speakers that are attending some of the content that's in store so me and ryan will be having a fireside chat with chris dixon himself uh but of course it does not does not stop there jiho from axi for all you axi players as well cooper turley the music nft lord of la as well as jai from rari stani from ave vance spencer from frameworks uh kevin o'walkie from git coin and of course some ethereum core developers like preston van loon and then we are on the hunt for some secret unreleased guests as well uh and so guys it's going to be just a reunion i think of the bankless podcast of all your favorite episodes anyways as well as some alternative layer ones for those that swing that way and some metaverse nft artist people pleaser will be there um and the full gamut the full spectrum of the entire crypto industry will have some sort of representation at permissionless i think it's going to be a great opportunity for people to meet other bankless listeners too right our communities spread out all over the globe so a lot of bankless listeners will be attending this and you can too of course bankless premium members get a 30 discount on a permissionless ticket which is big money now uh ticket prices go up every two weeks i think they're close to capping out but a 30 discount will save you hundreds of dollars if you want to go check that out we'll include a link in the show notes and so today david on the road to permissionless we have mark richardson who is the head of research at bancore which is like a an og protocol that that i think a lot of people have heard of but probably want to understand a bit further so we talk about that we also talk about what he uh wants to achieve at permissionless what some of the opportunities might be uh job opportunities that sort of thing and he gives some fantastic advice near the end on for first time conference goers i was taking notes of i like it it turns out david you can get your full roi on a conference ticket just by snatching free hoodies at the swag stores so uh that's that's something cool to tune in for as well yeah i remember uh grabbing a bunch of swag in east denver 2018 that swag turned into like og swag so like it's swag crypto conference is like it ages like fine wine right like over the years it starts to turn into the og swag uh so you got you got to get your get your swag early because you know in a few years there won't be any more swag like that all right guys we are going to get to the conversation with mark richardson the head of research at bancore so let's get to it hey guys uh this is the ridge permissionless we are here with mark richardson he is the head of research at bancore mark how you doing i'm doing so well ryan how are you doing uh doing great really excited about the conference that's coming up and of course that that is a theme we will get to want to hear about your thoughts in the conference what you're trying to get out of it but first you would be really helpful for i think banquet's listeners is some background on bancor so bancor is like a an og d5 protocol you guys are like one of the originals but yeah yeah so slightly before tell us about bancor yeah give us the tldr yeah absolutely so even um you know even before ethereum um you know bangkok was still a project so it was a actually a community currency project so the uh our uh first uh chief economist was bernard lita and so he's better known for being the inventor of the euro and so he joined uh bangkok and was investigating the the use of community currencies with us and so these were sort of small semi-contained projects some places in africa a handful of places in north america though we're really looking at the you know the way currency is used and whether or not you can have a system that isn't contingent on government issued fear and it turns out that it is possible um in fact it works quite well but the problem is is that every time that one of these contained economies has to interface with another economy um suddenly the community currency becomes well i don't want to say worthless but it becomes difficult to value right or at least no one can agree on its value so every time that you need to sort of pay for babysitting or something like that or someone to cut your hair or um you know basically sort of labor sort of things community currencies work very well but as soon as you sort of plugged into the global supply chain they stopped working right so you can't pay for gasoline for example with a community currency or um for produce from a farmer or something like that and so what we realized was that the problem is exchange right you need to find some way to interpret the value of a currency versus another currency um and that uh led to the creation of the the first automatic market maker concept and this is what bangkok took to its ico um and you know i think we raised something like a 165 million in two hours it's kind of a special ico because we actually deliberately stopped the raise right so that it could have kept going but after a certain period after you've raised a certain amount it doesn't make sense to keep collecting that capital so we actually stopped the race prematurely um i think for the time it was the world record holder for um for the the ico fundraising component um and so the whole idea behind that ico was to construct a um a market maker that used smart contract logic rather than human intervention um to automatically uh allow for different uh cryptocurrencies to to be valued against each other and so really you know the community currency component of bangkok came first and then the cryptocurrency component of bangkok was was born of that which is interesting um so bancor was um deployed on ethereum but just slightly before maker was right so it's actually you know you kind of call it the first d5 protocol i think etherdelta was you could say is probably technically first um but yeah you know it was right up there um and so the um at that time banco was still considered an exchange right there was nothing special about it defy didn't have a name yet um things like permissionlessness and and trustlessness weren't really a part of the narrative um in a big way yet um and so you know all of our legal advice was to to regulate and manage bancor exactly the same way that you would any other exchange so all of the laws that apply to finance and coinbase and everyone else um also applied to bancorp um if you wanted to start the liquidity pool we would send you the forms right which i know sounds ridiculous today but that's exactly how it was done and it meant that the user experience was pretty terrible um but you know it worked um i think the first liquidity pair there was gnosis versus bnt and there were a couple after that a couple of others after that things like power ledger i think was one of the first ones our coroner was one of the first um and you know it was it was working it was still it demonstrated the principle but i don't think that it really um tapped into that kind of culture of web 3 in any significant way so it was i maybe we can looking back at it now is a very elegant demonstration right proof of principle rather than an actual function product and so the uh there are a couple of criticisms against it one was that the um you know for something with this kind of utility um why not use eth right as the um as the base currency instead of your own token um and so the the ethereum foundation and battalion were you know motivated um to create a a grant program which was to create a bank or like um you know a bank or like protocol and use eth essentially as the base asset instead of b t and that's where uni swap was born from and so unisoft obviously borrowed a lot of those principles from bangkok it simplified some of those materials and and it massively improved the user experience and so after we saw what uni swap did and i would say that their biggest innovation was ignoring regulators right they they said you can have pools right it can be user owned pools they also started telling people you can earn fees which is something that our um our attorneys at the time said you absolutely can never say and so it kind of set this precedent right for d5 that we can actually start talking about these things i i think that we have to respect unison for having the backbone to do it and kind of trailblazing that path through the regulation not necessarily through the technology um and so after that we we launched uh version two of bangkok which is actually the first concentrated liquidity amm um and so it was actually it worked very very similar to uni swap e3 um except that it would automatically keep your liquidity in range constantly so we we used a chain link price oracle that would uh basically bend the curve such that it always behaved um like it was like it was in range um it would use a 20x amplification factor quite similar to curve v2 actually and what's what's amazing about this is this is eight months before uh uni swap e3 and almost 14 months before curve v2 and it worked extremely well right we had a all the volume in the world we only had like two pools in it um chain link was one of them um and it was you know massively performant on that kpi but unfortunately it just doesn't make money right and i think that the whole industry is waking up to that with regards to concentrated liquidity today um and so the we abandoned that model that was version two and then we launched version 2.1 and so version 2.1 was really trying to focus on some of the more user-facing uh issues of interacting with amms one is the requirement to to provide liquidity with more than one asset and so we we invented single-sided liquidity provision which means that you if you only want to provide liquidity with you know a certain token or with a handful of tokens in whatever ratio you want um banco will let you do it whereas most amms at the time would only accept you know two tokens or you know a prescribed basket of tokens in a fixed ratio and so we thought that that was unacceptable and we wanted to come up with an alternative to that and then the other thing that we wanted to address was impermanent loss so we think that it is concerning that so many protocols um defy sort of let the user's choice kind of be upon them you know they they don't do much to educate them about the financial risks of the the actions that they're taking and then kind of you know um are a little bit cavalier i i think is the word i want to use um with the funds once they're on the protocol and so at bangor we're trying to sort of push against that a little bit and say that the protocol is responsible for the user's welfare and so we've invented something called impermanent loss which is a type of insurance policy that says that whatever the uh whatever the the valuation is of your portfolio at the time that you provided it in the token you provided it that at the end of your liquidity providing campaign it should be worth at least that amount and you should have the exact same price exposure to the asset that you have provided so if you provide 100 link tokens for example at the end of your liquidity providing um journey when you withdraw the minimum value should be 100 link right in whatever you know whatever it's usd valuation is at that time and so this is actually pretty uh pretty sophisticated um it was a big part of our version 2.1 uh but version 2.1 was still an experiment right we there was no empowerment lost insurance um before bankrupt version 2.1 and we needed to really give it some some air right we needed to give it some room to run see how it performs and so over the course of about you know uh 14 months we were very conscientiously studying uh what was happening um and were improving um the theory a little bit and then all of that went into the design of bangkok version three um which offers that same impermanence protection but now um at an accelerated rate and it's also lifted things like the caps on the pools so in version 2.1 um as an insurance protocol um you have to be careful about how much tbr you have right because this means that your liability is increasing but for version three um we figured out a way that we can technically tolerate um you know infinite amounts of tbl and and not be any worse for wear with regards to the protocol's liability um so yeah the bank or version three is very very um you know it's a very very significant um step in in the right direction and i think that you know that there are other features and things that i think will save for the other part of the conversation that's basically how we ended up where we are that was quite for all so we've went through like the genesis of this thing through version one through through version two uh into version into version three and i think we want to talk more about version three but i have just a quick quick question for you mark so when people interact with uh bancor today and maybe bankless bankless listeners will want to know the answer to this are they generally interacting with kind of like some bancor front end or are they primarily uh interacting through liquidity through you know aggregators the matches of the world and and the one inches how are how are users uh getting access to these trading pairs and liquidity of bancor yeah so for to be a liquidity provider um i'm not aware of any sort of liquidity aggregated yet but there will be some um i'm absolutely certain of it i've met um a couple of teams at east denver that are building these things um but for now um you need to if you want to be a liquidity provider on bank call you you interact directly with bank bus front-end and that's app.bankcod.network um but if you are a trader um then you know bancor is already plugged into the you know the the dex aggregator space so if you're using one inch if you're using matcha um then you know you're uh you can easily get routed um through bancor and trades you know often will so it's very it's very likely that listeners who've used some of these aggregator services have already interacted with with bancor then without kind of knowing it because uh sort of you know deeper in the protocol stack in the in the back end yeah and so yeah and um i think you know if um there are a couple of really sort of popular assets things like wnxm um basic attention token chain link um so i think um you know bankroll has i think 85 percent of the the chain link liquidity on ethereum um and we've got i think slightly more than that and things like basic attention token you know where there are some uh some communities that have sort of gravitated towards bancor in a very profound way and so if you've ever performed one of those swaps by a one inch or another aggregator the chances are that it's gone through the bankroll balls mark you uh mentioned a few things that like uh differentiated you from from uniswap and i i think that's an interesting thread to to tug on can you talk about it from what i'm gathering can you talk about um just like the philosophical structure of of bancor it seems like you guys have a specific beliefs or a philosophy about how you guys build your bank or can you just illuminate that for the listeners yeah yeah i'm so glad you lost that actually so i i do you know i think you know bankless is kind of a high iq um you know listenership um and i i do recommend that reading some of um you know bernard leaders um books um but essentially you know if i if i had to sum it up i think that um if you imagine that okay first of all accept that the financial system is invented right it's not like a a a physical law of the universe or something like that right it's something that has has come from us and we control it um but it kind of also controls us right like it's it's kind of um like we we uh we discover it and invent it at the same time but there's still an infinite um spectrum of possible financial models right and we we're used to the um the dichotomy right things like you know socialism slash communism versus capitalism but actually that's a false dichotomy that there is a literally infinite spectrum of possible ways that you can set this up and so imagine for a second like what is the possibility or the probability that out just out of random chance through the course of human history that we've landed on like the ideal right or the optimum way to organize the world economy or even not even not even optimum but even good right that the chances are pretty slim and you know this is one of the things that bernard leader would write about is that there you know people think that there has to be only one kind of financial system um and it's it's one of the biggest faces in economics right there there are so many different ways to do things and this is why the uh the community currency um stuff was was such an important experiment for bancor and through him in the beginning um and so i think that that's kind of where we start to diverge a little bit um from from protocols like um unisport philosophically is that we are trying to build something brand new right we actually do believe in new economic um new financial products but also new economic theory um and we are you know sincerely trying to develop something that hasn't existed before um whereas i think a lot of our competitors are trying to recreate traditional finance on a blockchain and that there are um you know several ways that i i think i can justify um you know the way i'm thinking here um for example um i i still think that uni sort of like use v3 is an amazing product um but it's still in my view sort of something like a a limit order protocol it's highly imaginative and extremely clever um but it really is kind of a set your set your price kind of thing and wait for the the order to be consumed um and then we've also seen sort of these developing narratives around um you know this encroaching influence of traditional finance and private market makers trying to you know carve out a little piece of of land for themselves on blockchains um we know that um you know the the winter mutes of the world um interact with the the dex protocols in a very profound way um and i would stipulate that there are some of these uh traditional financial firms um that are you know already building products to try and you know uh have uh to maintain that power i would say in the developing eve a d5 uh sphere um and one of the things that i've seen developed there is basically the the complete recreation of exactly the type of order book systems and centralized market making systems um using you know more slightly more sophisticated blockchain products so i think they're calling these like the centralized limit order book things right clobs and what's interesting is that once you let the once you bring that uh thought process to its electrical conclusion you realize you don't need a blockchain at all right these these things already exist perfectly well in the systems that they're already implemented on and once they come to blockchains um you there will be no difference between using you know interacting with something like ethereum or avalanche and then just using you know coinbase over the internet except that one of them you know charges you prohibited gas fees and has you know mdv running you know mev issues and other things and i do think that it's perverse right i i don't think that um you know that they weren't invited this is kind of a private party you know defy is still a um a protest i'd say against kind of centralized control um and i i i think that a lot of these narratives are sort of designed to distract the industry um you know from the the stuff that we were actually building right from the um the you know the idea that we can do something that's never been seen before and yeah i think that bancor is very much still committed to that idea that we can do something you know important right we can we can do something like um you know valuable not just financial um and i i think that we're not alone right there are a lot of d5 protocols that i think feel the same way as us um but i don't i don't know if uni swap is among them i think unisoft is very sort of a a trap fire sort of leaning um influence with regards to its thinking but i can't put words in their mouth right i i can't speak for for hate not for dan robertson for anyone else um if this is just my my speculation but i i i honestly think that if they were on this call they might agree with me right that they do see blockchains as being a logical extension of the traditional financial system i i i can't know but i i have a feeling that that's the case well i didn't expect this to get so deep and philosophical but this is definitely the stuff that i get really really interested about so that was like zooming out and about like the the ethos of bancor i want to zoom back in and talk about one particular example one use case that this uh ethos might be expressed uh which is what you said about um impermanent loss uh can you actually explain how uh bancor protects its liquidity providers from impermanent loss what is that mechanism how does that happen yeah absolutely so the um the banco network uses b t as the the universal numerator right so all of the assets on bancora are paired with b t and because of that you know the price of every asset versus b t and therefore you know the price of every asset versus every other asset right it's the the common denominator um and so the uh when you provide uh liquidity in a single-sided fashion on bangkok um the protocol actually will min and provide bnc alongside you and so this is the how we power the um you know the single-sided liquidity paradigm but it's also what makes bankhold so capital efficient right because um you know imagine you're a new token project and you want to you know create a million dollar pool or something like that um if it's you know if it's new you might have to sell off something like 500 000 worth of your token which in the beginning might not be what you want to do um for another token and then provide both of them whereas on bank or you can just provide you know the entire stack whatever you want to be liquid right from the from the first instant um and okay when the when the banker protocol provides that b t on the other side that means that it owns 50 of the capital and so you kind of enter into a business agreement with the with the the bank or protocol and with b t holders and that's that the um that half of all of the uh swap fees um are going to be taken in b t and this is in a way it's just a consequence of of what's happening right so to david if you and i were going to start a pool anywhere right maybe you've got some usdc and i've got some eth um and we say you know we'll put in half each right into whatever you know into whatever liquidity pool we want it makes sense that whatever the revenues are we should split 50 50. and so what's interesting in the bankruptcies it just happens to be that that you know one of your you know one of your business partners is just a an impassionate you know protocol a smart contract but it does own fees um and as as it earns fees right it doesn't do anything with them right it's not going to sell them it's not going to um you know withdraw them or anything like that and so what they're there is is this kind of equilibrium where as the um as trading volume um you know it accrues across the protocol the the bank bancor system itself essentially sort of vacuums in bnt slowly from the secondary markets right and it accumulates kind of sticks to the pool um in the form of the swap fee and so let's let's call that k1 right rate in the rate out is uh price related and so you know bancor is a a volatile token just like the rest of cryptocurrency and so there's this constant sort of breathing in and out of the the bnt uh token from the pools right if bnt is performing well that week then a little bit of the bnt will trickle out of the pools and end up on the secondary markets um and if b t is going down then it actually vacuums your b t at an increased rate right because this is the way automatic market makers function um so there's um whatever that rate is right so if b and t is performing well then it increases the rate out called that k1 um and then if it's not if it's um not performing well then it increases the rate in right we'll call that k2 the other kind of rate in is from what we call the the bank or vortex and so this is essentially a kind of economic cleanup process where um you know as it's probably too much detail for this conversation we'll have it another time but essentially it means that um the the bank or protocol has access to discounted b t um through um you know buying into a type of debt market that's internal to bangkok where people basically sell their their right to withdraw or take a loan against it and the bank or protocol will then buy that back at a discount so for most of um version 2.1 history we've been collecting what's called a you know a network fee similar to sushi or something like that but it's not rent extracting it's used to um to essentially purchase a an insurance policy right so that the bankrupt protocol has a way to offset the the inflationary risk that it that it has when when users are receiving insurance payouts and so as long as these rates oh sorry and then the most important one of course is that uh when you are withdrawing um if there is insufficient tokens um in the in the protocol um to refund you your entire um you know allocation in the token that you wanted then the bankrupt protocol will mint additional b t and give that b t back to you so it's an insurance payout in the truest sense right um if you have an insurance policy on your car for example and you you know if you write it off um the insurance company generally doesn't give you another car they give you the cash for that car right so it's the same thing on bank card right if you provided 108th and then you go to withdraw and because of price action you only withdraw 998 right then the bandcore protocol will refund you whatever that last ether is in bnt using its own um using its own pool as a price oracle to determine how much b t that is plus whatever fees should have accrued on that position during that time um and in a way this is extremely um you know this is easy for bancor to to do and it's also um you know easy for the the user to use because bnt is one of the most liquid um erc20 assets on ethereum right the 80 to 90 of the supply at any time um is inside the liquidity pools and so even if you get something like a million dollar payout to drop in the ocean right the the bancorp protocol can um can easily swap that without impacting the price at all um so yeah that's the um that's kind of the the components of it so just wrapping that up right trying to summarize it um all users on bancord do pay a premium it's it's it's equal to at the moment it's equal to 15 of swat revenue um but it's you know when we introduced it we're saying that we're going to target 20 um over the period of i think 18 months and so we're that's soon gonna go up to 20 and stay there and so that's an insurance premium that helps to cover the liability of the protocol and introduces a counteracting deflationary measure on top of the inflation that the bank protocol experiences as a result of insurance payouts mark i think it's just really obvious how much thought and care has gone into uh designing the the bancor protocol and definitely with uh protecting users as um as a top priority so that's very very admirable inside of an ecosystem that sometimes kind of forgets that whole side of the side of the equation uh what other aspects of the bank or three the newest version of bancor really excites you what what what should listeners know about that we haven't covered yet and by the way mark as you're getting to that just to quick give us a quick refresh on when bank or three actually arrives oh yeah yeah i mean we so we you know software development is like uh we generally try to stay away from uh hard deadlines um but you know we uh as we get closer to to launch we are trying to give the community um sort of a um you know a rough idea of when to expect these things um so we said that uh so we actually we opened up the code this week for the first time so we had a public a private github that we were using to um to build everything um so that we didn't you know sacrifice any competitive advantages during the development period um we've just recently opened that up so if anyone wants to actually inspect the bank or three uh source code you can now um we were we're aiming to get the an incentivized beta test out this week um it's probably gonna happen this weekend honestly um and so that would be limited pools um certainly a small number of assets and fixed uh tbls while we run the a million dollar bug bounty on the system to you know to try and stress as much as possible i'm expecting that the the full launch will actually probably happen um the the week that i'm in uh permissionless and this was uh this is a total accident um but it just so happened to to go that way um obviously we wanted to get it out earlier but we've been um you know we don't uh compromise on security ever and so if something's not ready or if the order does ask for more time we always give it to them and so that's kind of what the process has been so far but we've just finished our first audit with peck shield and we've got a our second audit with open zeppelin um is currently underway um and so by the time that it rolls out we're hoping it will be uh you know a completely bug-bounded um twice uh audited and uh you know a fully open source system so that's that's when it's coming probably yeah probably beginning of may uh is is my expectation so yeah some of the there are so many features in vancouver version three and i don't want to spend uh sort of too much time speaking about all of them that if i had to choose um just a handful um i think that the one that i would um the one that i would focus on is the the new fungibility and composability of the system so on version 2.1 and i'm sure that you guys will you know appreciate the reason for this um all of the user positions were completely non-fungible um in fact we didn't we didn't issue users pull tokens at all they they were still there but they were um immediately staked in an insurance contract with the time stamp and some price information and that's you know the protocol needs that um for calculating the uh the user's impermanent loss at the time that they withdraw and so you know i think often when people talk about impermanent loss they treat it as if it's something that the whole pool has or that the whole system has they don't realize that it's specific to the time and price that you provided liquidity to a pool and so every single user has their own unique and permanent loss and this is a huge you know gas overhead let's say and it's made version 2.1 very expensive to interact with so for version three we've actually um we figured out a way to make that composable and fungible um and that means that the the gas overhead is is going to come down a lot it's going to make it a lot easier for um for users who aren't high net worth individuals who interact with the protocol but it also means that we open the door to some really other interesting use cases um so just for example just yesterday i was talking with the the link pool team um if you guys know who they are um and you know one of the uh you know and they're a phenomenal project um and in a way um they're kind of suffering from um the uh the success and popularity of their token so um you know the the lpl token has been so popular um and its use case so so attractive that now something like 98 supply of the token is staked on their own protocol and that means that there's only two percent left in circulation for for price discovery and that kind of illiquidity can cause huge problems it hasn't for them right they generally uh it's i'd say the protocol is very healthy overall um but it you know if it does want to grow or if it does want to you know start catering to new audiences it really can't and so with banco's single-sided staking paradigm and in permanent loss protection we are discussing the idea of instead of using lpl itself using bnlpl so it get uses to stake lpl single-sided on bancor and received the single-sided pull token and because it's insured from impermanent loss and because it still has that proof of ownership of the tokens that it represents it's actually just as um just as attractive um to ask users to stake that pool token because it's still um you know its price is 100 correlated to the underlying asset but actually uh just a little bit better than that because of the the feed accumulation and so you can use bnlpl for the intrinsic use case that lpl was built for um rather than the lpl token itself which means you're no longer competing um for uh liquidity and you know and staking use cases and there are a handful of other projects that i've had this conversation with so snx for example is one of the really interesting ones um instead of using snx to mint synthetic assets using bns and x to min assets is is super interesting um and so yeah i think that that pool token technology the idea of having something that is protected from a permanent loss already liquid um and you know composable with whatever protocol that you have um is is you know going to be a major theme of the coming year because i think that people that over the the last you know bull season um ignoring you know the the importance of liquidity has been to our projects you know detriment and so yeah we're hoping to help the the industry with that problem you know mark i almost hate to ask this question because i know you guys are heads down on uh version three but can we even look to future versions beyond version three so like what does a version four look like what does the three to five year roadmap for bankwear look like yeah so what so what's interesting is that so when i um when i started designing version three um it was actually a it's a much much larger product than what we've released right although what's being planned to be be released and so you know we've decided to you know it would have been um so stressful right further for the community um to have waited all of those years while we just build that single you know that single product and just release all of the features at once and so we've instead committed to sort of a tiered release schedule so bank or version three is actually going to be released in three phases and so all of the all of the features that you've heard about and our you know marketing materials um that's all coming in may right that this is all part of the bank or three phase one release which we call dawn but there are two more phases after that right there's phase two which i think is called sunrise and then phase three which we're calling daylight um and really most of the features that would that are that we've described um are all things that you get sort of for free with the new organization of the smart contract system um so things that i haven't spoken about right things like auto compounding rewards and gasless reward systems you know things like single token uh you know single hot trades um you know uh things like instant impermanent loss protection rather than vested in permanent loss protection these are all features that you get just from having a system that is built you know from scratch for this purpose rather than trying to you know create a smart contract layer over the top of the old uh version one system to give it this feature bank or version three is designed from the ground up for these new things right there isn't a single line of code in version three that was in either of our previous versions um so the um yeah the the things that we're all looking forward to the things that we've been public about is just the the first um the first wave of features um so the over the course of the next couple of years we're going to be committed to both the phase two and phase three releases um and this is going to i think you know continue to um you know continue to demonstrate just how sincere we are about that that mission statement that i said earlier in the call that you can do something brand new right that you don't have to just recreate traditional finance but you can do something that no one's seen before this is a really cool time mark to uh to i think have the permissionless conference as well because here you guys are at the dawn of bancor v3 and uh that could happen very well the week that that permission list is going on yeah which is uh exciting i think for everyone else you're probably like shaking your head and being like oh that's that's slightly terrifying because it's a conference at a major release date but um can you tell us uh about permissionless so what are you most excited uh for at permissionless what are you what are you planning to do what sort of folks are you looking to meet and who are you looking out for yeah so i think you know there's always kind of the the conference business as usual right so i'm always interested in meeting um you know other developers and other community members and just kind of um you know especially people that i've spoken to either on podcasts or over twitter or something they haven't met in real life it's always so cool to kind of meet them in person i'm sure you guys get that as well um but yeah specifically for permissionless because it's so close to our um version three release and because of sort of the nature of commissionless right like you know i i did decentral miami for example in november of last year and there's a type of conversation that's appropriate for a conference like that you know it was very nft leaning um it was very sort of ap i don't know i'm trying to think of the right um you know the right time yeah dj right and then you know there are other conferences where you want to have a much more serious discussion um and then there are some conferences in the middle right so things like um like i just did the avalanche summit um and and seller and so there it's like you know did that people are mostly like super interested in their own blockchain right and you know what that means and so having a discussion about d5 in a general sense um you know it's not always the best audience to engage with but i think for permissionless the the type of audience that you get there right and the kind of people that are listening um you know it it changes your delivery right it's a much better opportunity than if you want to say something meaningful um and have people you know respond and and criticize you right it's not just about pontificating from you know as if from the pulpit or something it's about you know starting a discussion and you know if people disagree with you i want them to approach me and discuss it um but i think that that's the kind of thing that i'm looking forward to permissionless right people that are really thinking about the future of the industry what what does it need um and you know how do we get there and you know us challenging each other on on some of the the preconceived notions that we have some of the assumptions about what it means to be deep fire or what it means to be a successful protocol um so i'd say more than anything that that's what i'm looking for to a permissionless because you don't really get it i think at any other conference mark generally everyone is hiring in this industry are you guys hiring over at bancor and for people that are going to permission lists uh who what kind of talent are you looking to meet and also what kind of uh like bd relationships are you looking to establish there yeah absolutely um so um yeah because of the the compressibility of bank or version three um we're all we're actually looking to um to talk to people that want to build on the system want to build with the system um and you know we can we can support in in so many ways there so it's not just uh you know here's the the bank or three rule book and and you know off you go um we really want to sort of um you know hold hold the other developer's hand through the learning process a little bit educate them on the system um you know we can share some simulation tools and other things that that would help um you know other projects learn it but basically anyone who is launching a new token project uh anyone who has an existing token project and has worried about their liquidity problems has worried about the um let's say the the expense and unreliability of things like liquidity mining programs um you know if any of these things have bothered you before come and talk to us because we think we do have a you know a fairly um you know robust solution to the problem of on chain liquidity for for the long tail of tokens um so that that's kind of the bd relationships i'm looking to um to to develop it's not it's not specifically teams with tokens that they need liquidity um but even you know if you've got an interesting idea right if there's something that maybe your protocol uses um uses liquidity in in an unusual way um if you've got some other um you know some other process that you want to discuss i'm also interested to develop those pde relationships um so with regards to um with regards to talent um we're always seeking um you know solidity developers um and you know we're we're pretty um you know we're pretty selective and you know that is sort of represented in um our remuneration packages um and so you know if you are uh if you think if you consider yourself a solidity star and you're friendly right with there are people that we refuse to work with um despite their how i'm talented that they are um but yeah if you're a good fit for the team and and you think that bancor is an interesting product then there's absolutely no reason that you should have any doubt that we would hire you um so yeah the other thing we're looking for like we're always looking for things like full stack back-end stuff um front-end developers um and of course um you know i'm building out my research team um so you know it started out pretty small i now have about four people um you know helping me develop the the new back or economic theory um and if if that's interesting to you right if you are maybe a a student um or you know a scholar of economics and if you're familiar with burned leader and the kind of that kind of concept of like alternative you know economic models i'm very very interested to chat with you um especially if you're a you know a strong writer right um there's a lot of research papers to be written over the coming years um and we you know i i have a plan to target a pretty aggressive um you know publication policy um so yeah uh we'll see if that happens but if that describes you you don't necessarily need to have blockchain experience you don't need to be a solid developer to understand what we're trying to do and you know if that appeals academically to um to your background then i'm equally interested to chat with you there's something very refreshing about protocols hiring economists that that seems that seems something that's perhaps lacking in this space also i can def yeah and i can always plus one to if you have the ability to write the world is your oyster especially in this industry yeah mark you you seem like a uh a conference veteran for people that have not yet been to crypto conferences or just really haven't experienced what a large conference like permission list might be what advice do you have for for the conference newcomers yeah don't be shocked when you get there on the day and there's a line that's four and a half hours long um wow so i mean i i haven't done permission list yet um but so far you know um the like were you guys at eighth denver i was yeah right so i think that they they got something like you know 5x or 6x the the attendance levels that they were expecting um and so you know there were a lot of complaints that day about sort of being forced to stand out in the snow and uh you know wait to get get admission and that kind of thing uh but it kind of felt like a once-off um but then of course avax was also completely inundated with um you know with demand um and i i'm expecting that you know there's kind of a trend here right um i i think that conference um attendeeship or even people just trying to get in right even if they don't have um a pass um is skyrocketing right it's basically tracking with the popularity of dfi in general which makes sense um but that's it after that um your expectations basically can't be high enough um if you're i would say if you're going to these conferences you definitely want to spend time at the booths right so the i i would say that um it might be a rookie mistake to think that you know you have to be at every seminar right or that you know if there's um you know or that you should spend your majority of your time at seminars um i'd say that that's the the absolute opposite of what you should be doing um there's probably like one or two talks like maybe from people that you've heard speak before or that you agree with or you think are interesting or for a topic that is new to you and you would like to learn more about that kind of thing um but if you're spending all of your time um you know sitting and staring at the stage um you know it's it's going to tune out that's just going to feel like sort of a nine to five at university or something like that um so i would definitely say choose like one or two talks um and let them be the talks that you're excited for and then you want to spend the majority of your time in the boots right talking to like actually talking to people and asking them about their projects and sort of grilling them a little bit right like you know why is your protocol necessary what does it do why um you know why why are you doing this what are your plans um you know how big is the team are you worried about such and such um you know what's going to happen when you know whatever this thing's happening or how do you feel about regulation all of these kinds of things it's a really great time to to get into those questions and you'll be amazed at how much more you know how much more transparent and forthcoming people can be in person when they're not you know answering for uh you know an attack on or a perceived attack on over twitter or something like that so the quality of the of the conversations that you're having um in person at a conference i say are much much higher than anything you've ever experienced and i think that um yeah that's that's the advice that i can give you um and also bring a backpack for all of the swag right it's like uh you know you want to make sure that you collect as many t-shirts as possible don't be shy you know the people brought that merchandise to spread it out there's often tables with like piles and piles of hoodies and stuff with no one taking them because everyone's being too polite don't be that guy just take the hoodie uh that's what it's there for i can definitely plus one basically all of that advice go only pay attention to the talks pay attention to the calendars mark they uh mark the talks that you want to go to but the uh but then go to the booths because i remember my first conference in east denver 2018. i still have friends that i made while talking to people at those booths uh so mark you and i are definitely aligned with how to do conferences mark thank you so much for for coming on to uh this road to permissionless show and uh giving us a good gospel of bancor and i'm really excited to see v3
