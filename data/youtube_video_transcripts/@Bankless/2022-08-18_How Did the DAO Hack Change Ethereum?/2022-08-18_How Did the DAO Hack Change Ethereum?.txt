how did the trajectory of ethereum change because of the dow hack obviously we hard forked but like more about the developers and just their mental state so i would say there were a few people who had to deal directly with the stress and pressure of making that decision being the one to code certain things being the one to challenge their ethos and having a lot of people yelling on reddit and twitter and podcasts or like all kinds of stuff some of them took breaks afterwards and were able to handle it other ones fell out i will say there is a positive to this in that the dow hack fractured the community in a way where people who were purist from a immutability standpoint went with ethereum classic and then ethereum kept people who were practical i would have been fine if we had let the attacker keep the ethan and the uh dow tokens etc but i respected the fact that there was a lot of discussion with the community from around the world that vitalik and others did to come to the conclusion that there should be kind of a signaling system from leadership including some of the core devs vitalik others that this should be the default option in clients
