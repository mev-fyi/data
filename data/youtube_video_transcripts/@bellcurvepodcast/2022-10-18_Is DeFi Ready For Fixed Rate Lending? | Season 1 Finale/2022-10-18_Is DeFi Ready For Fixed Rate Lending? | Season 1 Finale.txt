[Music] all right buddy this was a fun this was a lot of fun as a season I think when we're recapping this last season I think it might be good to just why are we doing this show what's the purpose of it I think part like bell curve is supposed to explore parts of crypto that might not otherwise get the spotlight I think not necessarily we're just trying to be right although obviously you and I do believe the stuff that we're we're talking about here and the thesis that we put forward but it's more of an exploration right of this one specific idea and it's also kind of a call to to crypto to look you know say you believe in something stake it and then say hey I was right or I was wrong and hopefully when you're listening to the show it encourages other people to say hey I was right or I was wrong and it's that should be a part of the discovery process I think and we could use a little bit more of that I mean there's also uh I don't know if you ever heard Kobe on up only talking about this maybe a year ago talking about the folks who end up doing well in crypto are the people who find interest in something through the bear market and I think one of the other things you want to do with this show is uh there are all these really interesting things that happen in the bear Market but because the prices are depressed 90 oftentimes a lot of people lose interest and then the next bull market happens and you're like holy where did these things come from you're like oh they're all built in the last two years so one of the things that I think is interesting about bell curve is it should give people a look into the interesting things and I'm it's given me a look into the interesting things that get built during the bear market so this I mean this was a great season exploring uh exploring D5 but specifically some of the nuances of like fixed rate lend uh fixed rates lending and borrowing uncollateralized London borrow um a bunch of stuff that I honestly didn't know too much about going into the show and yeah I don't know I learned a lot me too I think if I had to sum up this this season I think this was I think this is a pretty bold ambitious thesis and where we I think the what where I ultimately ended up coming down after talking to the guests that we did over the course of the show I feel very Vindicated that fixed rate borrow lend 100 gonna be a thing on chain credit markets 100 going to be a thing I think the timing aspect of this and all of the different markets and products that need to get built out in order for this to become a thing that's what what we might have missed a little bit is just on the timing and you and I were flagging that by the second or third episode right like all of the different things that were going to need to happen uh in order for victory borrow and on-chain markets that was going to need to be a while yeah I I also think one one more thing I'll turn over to you I thought the other thing I thought that I didn't understand quite well enough going into the beginning of the season was the degree through which you need to be looking at this is the lens of Regulation basically and more and more in my conversations with other Founders in crypto especially ones who are building out protocols the specifically the U.S regulatory environment is driving an enormous amount of actions right now I think yeah I need to look at it through that lens I mean even when we were thinking about setting up season one there were protocols and companies and Founders that we wanted to invite on the show that had that they didn't get brought on because they had shut down their companies or they had printed because of Regulation so I think you're spot on I mean the the thesis going into the show let's revisit it right the thesis going into the show was that uh basically all all London bar and crypto right now is variable uh if you look at traditional Capital markets only like 10 of London bars on these variable terms like 90 is is on these fixed terms um but in crypto that that's not how things look the fixed rate like if you take a 30-year mortgage that's not like a that's not a beast uh that exists in nature that's not a thing that exists in nature you have to go create that through different uh mechanisms like interest rate swaps and stuff like that so we were exploring how things like fixed rate London borrow could get could get built out and specifically I think one of the core Theses was that the enabling fixed rates in crypto and like a booming fixed rate Market would kick off this next uh would would kick off a debt driven uh credit boom in in crypto and I think that we were right that fixed rate London borrow is going to be big but I don't think that we were right that it'll kick off this next full cycle I'm curious to get your take on that yeah I agree with that I also think if you go back to even the first remember the first part we kicked off the season with Michael and Vance now not on the Roundup but the first episode that we did d5's dead Long Live Defy is we're going to see a Renaissance in on-chain infrastructure and I do think that I think that the way the infrastructure of space is going to play out over the next year year and a half do you rewind to the bear cycle that you and I started block Works in that was that's all the birth of all these great you know I guess you'd call them off chain right kind of centralized Capital markets type companies the fire blocks is the block fives of the world I think there's going to be overall probably consolidation in that space especially on the exchange layer that feels that feels we've been talking about that forever but I think regulation is probably what's going to kick that into gear so there's going to be consolidation especially in the exchange layer and I think probably what's going to get funded and a lot of the new infrastructure products are going to be on chain type infrastructure products right to replace some of their centralized or or in some places not even replaced but complement their centralized counterparts so I think we got the Catalyst right I think that's I think that's totally correct then when it comes to borrow and lend one thing that at least I learned throughout the season we kind of had an idea about this going in but just the tremendous amount of things that need to happen in order in order for there to be fixed rate borrow lend right like what you need we talked about kind of Midway through the season uh options like deep and liquid options markets that in of itself is just going to take a long time I think and I think one of the big question marks for me is how like the purpose decentralized option markets are going to play out right now perp markets have decentralized markets have a big advantage in that they concentrate liquidity if you're trying to make markets for options with different expiries suddenly the way the math kind of works out is like all right if you've got an option on eth right you need one that adds you know September of this year you know December of this year Midway through next year Midway through next year suddenly you're making you have to make liquid so many different markets just very challenging especially in a bear market so I think that part of things is going to take a long time and then you just need term structures on your debt why these crabby we don't have everything is like rolling in terms of debt that's insane for our capital I mean like that's such a wild concept so they're just these very basic building blocks that need to happen I think when we talked to our guests and said hey it makes sense that most of the variable rate debt today is going to become fixed rate tomorrow everyone says yes but then when you start to dig into what that actually means and the amount of on-chain infrastructure that needs to get built out yeah or a little ways I think we're a little ways away from it so so here's one of my takeaways I think that you're going to have this booming debt Market in crypto but it's going to be at the next cycle actually um I think we were one cycle too early because um I thought that when we went into this deep bear Market we were going to come protocols were going to fundraise with uh we're going to fundraise with debt instead of equity but I mean we're a year into the bear Market we're seeing companies just raise Capital Equity uh raise Equity at just lower valuations um like we just saw you know swap raise um at like a much lower valuation than they would have gotten in the bull market and I think one of the reasons that that's happening is there aren't baked out on-chain debt markets yet um and and the second is I don't think protocols will turn on their fee switch and they'll Max I don't think they want to maximize fees in the bear actually I think what's going to happen is uh most of the tier one Protocols are just going to keep fees off they're going to try to like basically gain a bunch of market share watch the other folks who are less well uh funded start to dissipate and then in the bull market that's actually when they're going to turn on fees uh and I and I don't think I don't think they go to the debt more I don't think the debt markets end up looking super similar to how they look in traditional Capital markets I think it's uh I think they end up looking kind of like what Ben Forman was talking about where these Protocols are spitting off a bunch of Revenue and then uh the debt is coming from the smart contract right where you're actually baking in uh the payback period into the smart contract so yeah but but I think that happens in the next Bulls bull cycle is some of this stuff starts to really get like used and then in the next bear Market that's when companies turn to the dead markets what do you think about that yeah I think the important Dynamic that you're getting at there is that there's two ways of raising Capital right there's equity and debt financing Equity is more expensive but it's variable right so you or it's it's a non-cash expense so that makes sense for early stage companies where it's a lot of upside there's a lot of risk in in most early stage companies don't have access to a lot of capital so it makes sense debt financing is cheaper because instead of saying hey you get X percentage of ownership of the company you get the money that you're lending me plus you know five to ten percent or whatever it is but what you need there is you need steady and predictable cash flows and that typically doesn't occur until a company is is more mature so that's why that's another roadblock I think for for a lot of crypto companies which which aren't as mature on the other hand one thing that respite uh surprised me probably to the upside because I kind of came into it at least into the season thinking oh this was going to be kind of an out there prediction that Dao's we're going to turn to debt I think that was actually pretty consensus yes that that was going to be the case that eventually Dows were going to add debt to the mix I thought that was going to be a kind of out there prediction but it was pretty broad consensus about that um again with just the hold up being probably the two biggest holdups being one they don't have the steady predictable cash flows at least a lot of them don't um and then two again looking at this through the lens of regulatory the ones with the regulatory landscape in the US you can kind of make the case of these tokens might not be Securities probably a very strong case that they aren't when you raise something like debt I don't know I would quibble with you actually on the fact that I I don't think anything I don't think fee switches get turned on in Bull markets I think unpopular bear Market is the time for unpopular decision making right because you're kind of like well what have I got to lose anyway you know so I think unpopular decisions actually get made during during bear markets so I I don't think I don't think the bowl is when when you see a fee switch end up getting turned on but I again I think that I think that's going to come kind of hodgepodge and I don't probably the decision to turn on a fee switch start earning Revenue raising debt that that will probably be less of a reflection of any specific Market cycle and more of when the infrastructure is ready for it I think yeah that's fair um one other take what I had was just thinking about like what the yield curve could look like in crypto um yeah and this season came at a really interesting time right as eth moved from proof of work to proof of stake you get this like base yield yeah that's getting spit off from from the system so I'm that's something that I wasn't even really thinking about going into this season but that intertwined really nicely so I'm curious how you think about now that the season's over how you think about like what we were exploring and how that ties together with the move to proof of stake yeah I think that a yield curve ends up getting built out in crypto I wonder what ends up being the risk-free rate because the other interesting thing that happened as we were filming the season is there was an inversion right in tradifying crypto yields where previously for the last year crypto yields have been maybe not the last you know during the last bull market this whole narrative about yield being the Trojan Horse is going to Shepherd institutions in drag them in because there are these juicy you know 20 yields all the way to 100 crazy yields and there's no yield in Trad fund well the opposite of that is happening right now the tier yield at the time of recording this that's on October 16th like 4.5 percent and on the two year for and that's basically as risk-free as you really can get so does a risk curve end up does the yield curve end up getting built out yeah is eat the risk-free rate part of me wants to say yes because that would just work so beautifully a crypto native yield curve but the other part of me that was like if I actually put on my like I was managing muddy hat no I think the two-year is still yield and I think what uh the like the the 10-year two like gov U.S treasuries still set the risk-free rate so probably what you'll see more of there is is crypto finding ways to import traffic yields you're seeing that with maker down and other large protocols right now but I do think but I do think one thing that we in the future what I could see is Eve being a risk-free rate and I do think that yield products are going to get built out around that 100 it seems like a no-brainer to me yeah yeah oh you're seeing that blow up right now at Bitcoin mining which is that's kind of what that is too it's like hey uh proof of work right there's gonna be Bitcoin that you are and let me pull forward some of those earnings like so here yeah here's some cheap credit for you to buy miners uh so yeah does that principle still hold with First Acres and validators like hey you're going to earn this eat out into the future right like now with Mev boost as well that's like another opportunity to generate yield so again am I going to get some future revenues and should I be able to pull that forward with credit products probably how do you underwrite that though that's the question um so yeah I think it's going to happen though for sure yeah I'm sitting here in London I have one percent battery on my computer and I cannot get this damn converter to work so I don't want to uh cut this off too early but should we talk about season two should we talk about what's coming next for the show yeah I've got one more I've got one more um thing that I want to uh do it hopefully your computer holds basically I think what we're gonna see over the coming years is a period of experimentation in crypto so if you want to look at you know this is Tucson's observation that we've seen innovation in new token distribution mechanisms and get another way of saying that is equity financing it was icos in 2017 then it was I yields kind of binance launch pad then it was yield farming then it was nfts basically it was getting equity-like interest token interest in the hands of users slash investors right um and that's been a great form of financing for these crypto projects in over the coming years I think we're going to start to see experimentations in launching credit markets that markets and that's probably going to come uh you know there'll be two catalysts for that which is maybe three one more in the form of on-chain activity so check we're already getting that two you need borrowers that have predictable cash flows so you need more mature borrowers in the form of downs and then you need a way to speculate on it and and that actually probably like is that is pretty easy to do right whistle leverage speculation that happens in traditional financial markets happens in debt markets and derivative markets so I think we'll get that in crypto but you know we need um and it along with that we'll get a whole bunch of different experimentation of of different things right clearly you could hear uh right from from this season that we think we're going to collateralize debt offerings with tokens I think they're I think that's a really interesting experimentation I also think there's probably a good cause for worry there but I think whatever happens is there's gonna be a whole bunch of new experimentations well I think the worry is fine by the way like I think um I think how most things end up getting built not just in crypto but in history as these basically bubble Cycles um and the bubble drives a lot of capital the capital drives a lot of human Talent human Talent builds cool things get into a big bull uh bull market or bubble whatever you want to call it things collapse but the Innovations some 10 of that Innovation carries through into the future and so we saw this with or like there's no arguing that icos weren't this like ridiculous bubble um that capped out with a protocol raising four billion dollars but there are things from the Ico bull market of 2017 that have carried through to today right nfts hit this huge bubble but there are things from nfts that are carrying through um and I think we'll see that with Dad right like token uh collateralizing things with tokens um probably not a great idea like collateralizing things with very early stage tokens there's something that will get formed there it will probably lead to some bubble but it but some part of that will carry through you know yeah now I think one of the the interesting you get from this by the way for sure yeah one of I think what you get from those bubbles is things that in The Innovation will produce things that could happen in crypto that could never happen somewhere else right and we talked about a couple of those very specific examples this season so instead of right the dynamic where let's say you and I went out got some debt and we used to fund you know conferences you know new Personnel uh marketing whatever that was and then we're supposed to use that money for those things then pay return instead what you could do is basically say you know hey this money only could be used to fund those things and if you're a protocol then it's you get even more transparency on it because you could say hey I'm getting x amount of Revenue I will pay you back in some sort of royalty structure until you get all your principal back plus you know 10 a year or whatever you agree on and you know now I'm saying this out loud I do wonder if a there is a connection in between the end of yield farming and turning on these fee switches and that debt structure so let me let me paint a picture for you here right right now companies build market share by basically giving away tokens right yield Plumbing we know we know that that's on its way out right Founders don't like that it creates cell pressure they're giving away it's very very costly way of doing customer acquisition Etc and people have been afraid to turn on the feed switch now what if what if there was some kind of proposal that said something to the effect of in the uniswap right where they haven't turned the fee switch on hey guys we um we don't want to give out I know they don't really do this anyway but like token rewards right we don't we want to find a way to incentivize or fund our our you know the protocol here without necessarily giving out more rewards again new Thoughts with that example whatever uh you know we'd like to do that with debt and and the way we're going to do that so that it doesn't impact you guys or the treasury is we're going to turn the fee switch on and the fee switch you know half of the fee switch is going to be go go towards paying down this debt you see what I'm saying you see how those ideas are sort of connected actually I wonder if you know turning on fee switches and actually accruing fees and Revenue you know gets there's a connection there obviously in between debt as well definitely financing yeah that's interesting that's a really interesting take it was so interesting doing this episode during this season while all this other uh bigger like crypto macro stuff was happening like uh moving to proof of stake you've got this base rate um uh what yeah what you were just talking about with like um uh like uniswap and the p-switch like all these other bigger conversations around around just like Revenue coming from protocols I I feel like it's all starting to tie together and I think that's what usually happens in the bear markets there are markets are times for unpopular decisions I think nobody there's there's a negative set of incentives or the game theory of doing something unpopular when you're growing your protocol and you might be gaining market share maybe you're just growing your protocol much faster than you ever thought possible the risk reward in the mind of a Founder is pretty unbalanced right why would I give up all this this growth that's happening on a week over week month over month basis for something that I can probably do later well when everything sort of crashes down around your ears say well the worst has already kind of happened I might as well rip the Band-Aid off do this thing that I knew that that I should have been doing for a long time and start actually earning revenue and accruing fees and you know I it's it's tough because this is the natural life cycle of companies in general it's a Silicon Valley playbook in general which is you subsidize your product for your early customers you get that product Market fit what you try to do right the unsaid things you try to create a monopoly and then you can then you have pricing power then you can raise and start generating cash hand over fist the question is and this is where kind of an art and a scientist kind of just depends on what your investors expectations are but you you need to start earning at some point and the question I think many are starting to ask in crypto is when do we feel it's appropriate for companies in crypto to start doing that and the answer is it probably depends on each each different protocol yeah now that we're sitting here so we've had these like seven grade episodes and a bunch of great interviews and explored these debt markets when do you think that the debt markets I'm trying to even put like what is the number that what like what are you looking at to say like okay the debt markets in crypto have arrived you you would want right the the rough analog is the amount of outstanding debt right Sovereign and corporate debt plus you know compared to equity markets is like roughly the same there's more the the debt markets are larger than the equity markets I I mean we're talking about this so early it's very hard for me to get a line of sight into when that happens but it makes sense to me that probably roughly that's where we end up right equity and debt markets being around the same size I think when you look at probably doubts having a decent mix of you know debt-funded Capital right like that right maybe maybe and what's your favorite call if you're a dow why do you why why do you think again now that we've had all these conversations why do you think that they would tap the debt markets because it's cheaper Capital yeah cheaper yeah yeah just feels like you we're deep into the bear market and people aren't even exploring yeah I yeah yeah I think when this gets big is the next bear Market is the next bear Market bearable I I think it has less to do with like bear versus bull market versus just available in Bull markets right um well well no equity Equity is I mean Equity is pretty expensive during during full Market it's actually like that's I mean that's uh your Equity is valued higher right so yeah I mean I I guess yeah that's when you call us when you want to sell yourself yeah yeah yeah um I I again I think it probably has less to do with that and more just when there are deep liquid markets that you can tap right I mean like for example coinbase which is one of the only companies in crypto that has access to public debt markets I mean they took out a one and a half billion dollar uh you know they issued a billion and a half dollars worth of debt right before the for the end of this bull market and that was just to prepare so prepare for the bear so I don't know I think it has less to do with there's probably some of that like playing around different timing but I think mostly the the prohibitor is just infrastructure uh the the infrastructure whether or not it's ready and enough Dows having enough mature predictable cash flows they just don't have it yet yeah so um but ultimately you know what you can see is I think the the building block the Lego building block nature of defy it lends itself extremely well to to Dev markets and a lot of what I think D5 does at the end of the day by eliminating any immunity areas and all this excess kind of built up cost is makes things more transparent makes things more Capital efficient that like lives off Capital efficiency it's an enormous part of it so yeah I think I think ultimately D5 is very well positioned to create these sorts of markets but but the questions just went and what's ultimately going to be the Catalyst who knows yeah it's often weird things I was on a call you know we've got Daft London coming up uh this week and this guy said something I kind of knew at the time but I've forgotten he's like 2019 would save the bear Market was uh was Facebook saying that they were going over a lot of stable coins like where you know that that feels obvious in hindsight you're looking at it like yeah but no one had that on their 2019 bingo card you know no one's like yeah the biggest social network in the world is going to say we're going to launch a stable coin so a lot of times you know we can speculate on these things but it'll probably be something out of left field that we're not even talking about similar to when I mean no another thing no one had on a bingo card was like sovereigns and countries and corporates buying Bitcoin which in hindsight looks like it wasn't maybe the best idea but that did fuel a map like that did feel put some juice behind the bull market you know cute here's another thing that was interesting that came out during this filming with Adam 2.0 right so Adam 2.0 one of the the interesting things so I don't want to go map all this out yet but they basically they were they're finding a way to they want to create value a value a cool mechanism on the atom token right so they've got tendermint Cosmos SDK and IBC is kind of the base layer things they've got um I it they but they kind of improved on this interchange security right so they actually kind of rolled out some of the specifics there then they've got a a market for Mev I figure what the actual name for that is and then they've got this allocator this this uh this allocator kind of mechanism that's like a hazy weird gray area but a lot of what it is is you can do these weird sort of bonding exchanges right between the atom token and tokens that are built on the the within the atom ecosystem that looks a lot like it looks something like debt financing actually in a weird way so unsure of what that's ultimately going to be but that is definitely related to our our thesis as well so I I mean the atom ecosystem in general is is definitely something to watch yeah definitely yeah you want to talk about next season you want to keep folks waiting I think next season is really good uh we we are we're very very close to finalizing what it is that we're talking about but I think it's going to be near and dear to a lot of folks hearts that have listened to the season one we're going to keep you guessing I will say we've got some great guests coming on so maybe this can hinder the the themes of the season but we've got uh some of the folks from revelry coming on we've got hasu coming on we've got Chris on from Juan Ventures coming on as some of the early guests so really really strong lineup but we're gonna have to wait uh for two weeks to hear what the thesis is yeah so here's the schedule folks this is uh you're probably listening to us this the week of the 18th next week we're taking the week off uh a week off in between Seasons we're gonna have a Roundup per usual with Vance Michael from framework and then the week after the first week of November we're going live with season two that'll be a kickoff episode with Mike and me exploring the thesis for season two uh and then the week after we'll get into it with our first guest episode so yeah really excited to roll this out if you guys have liked the show do us a favor if you could just hit the five stars subscribe um I I got to be the hype man for the show one of us has got to do it you know so we got to get those five stars and then right review punch that subscribe review punch the Subscribe yes I do seriously we'll see for I'll see it for season two yeah thanks for listening season one guys see on the other side [Music]
