jump into the episode [Music] all right everyone welcome back to another Roundup of bell curve you got uh I'm still thinking about when you told me about my podcast voice Michael's wanted to piano Advanced welcome to show thanks for having me to be here Mike good to be here mid mid yeah Midsummer Mike over here with your Florida shirt ready to I'm in Florida where you're you're in Florida yeah it's actually he's been on the show it's miles it's uh it's miles 30th so I'm down here this is like the year of all my my entire friend group is turning 30. so they're like five 30th birthdays in various places so uh Vance and I were at a wedding this weekend I've got another one this upcoming weekend and one the weekend after it's lighting season Michael did what was it 13 weddings 14 weddings last year 11 weddings last year damn sounds like the beginning that he's invited to I've told all of my friends that I am only showing up to one of their weddings so you better make it count I've never choose one of your friends was like didn't invite you to the first wedding expecting you know the song of the second then one and done you get one you better be really sure do that seriously like I don't have that many weekends in a year I feel you I was just talking to this about like it's I was just talking to this guy and he's like oh it's gonna be a crazy weekend I was like yeah we're not going super wild he's like after 30 it's not called going wild it's called going wild so that's what we're doing this weekend go miles yeah it wasn't a hot tub classic well boy's not no girls allowed baby little girl allowed good chicks always got to bring chicks us too nice nice so nice so good stuff I'm enjoying my 30s more than my 20s just you know just to put it out there it's some children that was my suspicion too seems like 30s that's a good age to be already type early 30s yeah real hype are you two sub 30 or over 30 sub 30 what's up area wow get ready we're right there though I'm 29. so we're personally can we talk some crypto yeah before we painted too Vivid of a picture with the hot tub here let's get into crypto a little bit um should we do so we've got images yeah let's do some predictions because I think coinbase earnings are actually going to come out during during this this uh this recording so just to just to refresh people a little bit maybe I'll actually share my my screen I'll check um just so we can recap how coinbase did over the course of last year so they break out basically they've got two buckets with different subgroups underneath but they've got transaction revenue and they've got subscription and services Revenue obviously transaction revenue is the bulk of their business but Wall Street cares a lot about subscription and services because the general perception is transaction revenue is going to Trend down towards zero over time so they really want to grow that subscription Services part of their revenue within transaction Revenue they break it out in between consumer institutional the consumer bucket is much larger just because of the amount of fees you know it's kind of an unspoken thing I guess it's spoken but the fees that consumers get charged are much much higher retail it gets charged much higher fees on coinbase than the institute in the institutional part of their client base and then for subscription and services they break it out between blockchain rewards which is staking basically custodial fee Revenue interest income which is generated largely based on their partnership with circle the center Consortium and then other subscription and services which is kind of just a hodgepodge of different bets it's kind of like coinbase one things like that so and then and then I guess this is if you look at it in terms of their profitability so there's net revenue uh income and adjusted and as I was going back and it Brian guided towards there's a there's a change in philosophy at coinbase which is they basically had a goal to make all their money during bull markets and they were going to break even during these sorts of bear periods that has changed now and they have since guided that they want to be profitable in all market conditions although the CFO did walk it back a little and say well we're not committing to that in 2023 we want to see absolute growth in ebitda so classic the CFO kind of walking it back a little I'd be curious um I have some specific thoughts but I'd I would love to get your guys thoughts on hey what are you thinking about for for q1 how do you think it's gonna look I think there are a couple things that I'm looking at like maybe and we can break it down so on the revenue side of things I would um I would assume that q1 Revenue will look pretty similar to Q4 um but potentially higher and uh if you if you look at like I bet the user base has actually shrunk a little bit and I bet you'll see like downloads of the app for example are down but you have higher eat prices and higher I mean higher crypto prices across the board with higher interest rates which I think will dry have higher revenues so like first prediction I would have is higher Revenue a second prediction I would have is on the earnings side those are always a little tougher to predict but I think I think it'll look pretty good actually because they had some bad I mean they cut a ton of people yeah huge clouds huge layouts and um I don't know like what percentage of their expenses come from Personnel but you got to assume it's pretty high with like several thousand people and that huge layoffs so I bet their earnings will also look pretty good um would have to assume that they have do a lot of talk about like regular regulatory pressure both on the sleeping products side of things and then their their Wells notice um and I bet that'll be like the main focus of this and then uh one interesting thing that I bet like main main street or Wall Street like won't really talk about is um the new sources of revenue but I'd be curious to see how they start talking about like their International Futures markets um how they start like providing guidance around the L2 around base like that's what I think will actually be the most interesting aspect of this um that probably Wall Street will skip over so those are my high level predictions totally agree with all those I would say in addition just like breaking down this chart right here consumer I would say is probably going to be pretty similar if not a bit higher in terms of net revenue from transaction Revenue institutional I would imagine it's actually going to be pretty far down post FTX I would imagine that a lot of Institutions just frankly stop trading and I think in Q4 you had a lot of rebalancing and tax loss to harvesting that attributed to the 13 million that you see in that in that column the one that I think is going to be most interesting which um won't show up in q1 but I think will absolutely be present in Q2 and they'll probably talk about it or guide towards it in in the call is the actual blockchain rewards subscriptions and services Revenue I think post Shanghai a number of you know institutional Partners um put eth into uh the the staging program that they had and a lot of that I'd say all of that is probably East staking I'm sure there's some other staking opportunities that exist or persist but I would imagine that in Q2 that's going to jump the most um so whether or not they talk about it I I don't know but and it's not going to show up in in q1 earnings but blockchain Awards is is the one that I'm tracking the most Michael real quick I completely agree with you on the blockchain rewards and those are denominated those staking revenues are nominated in each so even if they basically stay constant the price appreciation is gonna do very well for that particular line item I would push back maybe a little bit on the institutional uh part of your observation because I mean maybe just a question to you obviously crypto's done super well year to date who do you think has been buying do you think that's been institutional driven or retail driven I would say it's probably more retail than institutional um but I think a lot of I guess they're American that I well the comparison that I have is from Q4 to q1 and I think a lot of the institutions were tax lost harvesting at the end of last year and so that's where a lot of that activity was driven from there has been you know price appreciation in January and and I that was probably a lot of Institutions rebuying so maybe this is flat maybe this is maybe it's even up I don't know but I do think that institutional relative to Consumer isn't going to grow as much yeah you might be right there was there was um I actually I went back and sort of skimmed the analyst notes from from Q4 and there there actually was a disclosure there that there was a an inbound in interest on the institutional side for Prime so they were onboarding a whole bunch of customers in Q4 um they did kind of walk that back though and say you know typically the the sort of relative balance between you know reap the retail and institutional part of their business doesn't change all that much but I don't know I could I'm not really sure I I don't really think retail is back in this market yet I I feel like they're not I agree I completely agree with that the one the one thing that I will say is that in Q4 late Q4 or maybe it was q1 they did switch everybody over from Pro who was a consumer from Pro to it uh Advanced trading and so there have been some product updates that I I personally have found to be uh on on the consumer side to be really beneficial that's kind of what I'm basing in terms of you know where this activity is coming from relative to the institutional side um anecdotally also just like institutions were not very active in q1 because they were trying to pick up the pieces of what happened after FDX yeah yeah coinbase has this you know Jason just in response to your question about about base coinbase has this framework that they used to talk to their analysts into Wall Street they called their 70 2010 framework and they say about 70 of our resources and focus is dedicated to our core business so basically everything that we're talking about 20 is allocated towards more strategic long-term Pursuits and then 10 is kind of their risk-taking Venture type Investments within their product portfolio which I actually think is it's easy to understand and probably a pretty decent framework for owning a business so I I kind of agree I think base is the wild card but I don't it's kind of that would be firmly in the 10 bucket so I doubt it gets much air time that that framework was um started by Google in the early 2000s and it was all about you know over 20 of time or something goes to the end they also want from anything they also did the yeah the 20 time uh for the engineers and 70 is how we're going to make money in the next three years 20 is how we're gonna make money in three to five years and ten percent is how we're gonna make money after the next five years like I haven't looked too much into coinbase's financials but what this tells me is that a they're not leaving the US like all of this is basically U.S revenue or U.S Centric especially on the retail side and two you know like the staking arguments or or I guess the walls notice hasn't formally turned into a suit yet but like they're gonna fight that tooth and nail like that's one of their only at least steady Revenue segments that has a chance to you know 5 or 10x so I don't know it seems like Brian is trying to set up a straw man for like you know we're really gonna leave if if forced to but at the same time like the math wouldn't bear that out at all like if coinbase left the us if coinbase gave up on staking like I don't know how much a coinbase would really be locked just just to reiterate I think I said this a couple weeks ago but like leaving the US doesn't mean they're leaving like they're still gonna have offices in the US it means like the technical headquarters is going to be based somewhere else but like nothing changes the product is still served to us customers they still make us money and pay taxes for those U.S revenues but it's just that you know the technical like headquarters would be in London or something yeah yeah so I guess we'll see I guess the just the last thing is that that interest expense that's really been carrying their whole services and subscription bucket of Revenue I think it's probably too late I like I that usdc dpeg I think that happened in March and then there's been a draining of right there's been uh you know some seven or eight billion dollars worth of market cap that's migrated out of usdc and into tether I frankly don't know how to forecast that because uh that even that market cap moving to tether doesn't even necessarily mean that the portion that they generate they generate their interest on is like they generate interest that's uh on usdc that's custody to coinbase so I don't even know if that blip ultimately ends up impacting that but it is worth calling it out because that is the the part of their that's the part of the services and subscription everybody that's basically been carrying that whole number and to be to be fair to Wall Street they've questioned that I'm not really sure it deserves to be in there frankly and enough interest expenses subscription are not likely to get more people to put a more principle into it at the size that they've been able to historically or be you know take advantage of the same level of interest rates just like doesn't feel like that's in the car it's giving everything that's going on you know with the the Regional Bank I guess it's not even a crisis or what like what it what's the name of it implosion like I don't know like I feel like that's the thing this is totally unrelated but like I feel like there's like this intentional and like Michael and I have talked about this before there's this intentional like memory holding or like trying to keep these headlines out of like Bloomberg or like New York Times to the Wall Street Journal it's like how many banks have won up at this point and like we're still not allowed to call it a crisis like just completely crazy to me it feels like there's some serious uh just like sheeple hurting going on at least for the mainstream media Outlets it does feel interesting like when in 2008 I mean everyone in the world knew that these Banks were blowing up and everything was collapsing and today you have like the size of the banks blowing up is actually much larger uh and I feel like nobody's really talking about it outside of you know thin land lesson there there's a lesson there I mean the lesson there is that like it's much worse than anybody is actually telling people well I will say I mean totally totally agree with all that so far throughout all this process there's been exactly zero dollars lost for depositors like there is an element of like okay sure shareholders are done bondholders are done you know the companies themselves are going through massive layoffs but our consumers are here nothing to see here it's a liquidity progress that is something I don't believe that at all like what like I mean but Michael in 2008 it was the same thing I mean the bank the bank accounts are backed by FDIC in 2008 as well yeah that's a little bit different because those were investment Banks and like when Lehman Brothers collapsed there were a lot of clients who lost a lot of money but I do think that there's an element I'm just saying your your argument that you're arguing that the because depositors didn't get hurt then it's not like a big mainstream thing no no it is I'm saying I agree I would say you know that being said so far nobody has lost money also right now I don't know like I saw the list yesterday of the after hours trading of like 10 different Regional Banks and Pac West was at the top of the list and they were down like 60 after hours um so like this isn't stopping yet but how far can the fdsc go and that stop in news how far you know like how how deep are the pockets right and is the FDIC Insurance Fund was before before all this and haven't it's not infinite it's like all out in 25 billion dollars or something I guess you know what I'm saying is we have staved off depositors losing money so far I don't think you can go forever it doesn't look like this is stopping something is going to have to give at some point and the second that depositors start losing money this is going to be like the biggest news story I think you know people are gonna be talking about I don't think any deposit is gonna lose any money I think we're just gonna print infinite money and just like I agree coming under the rug like that's why we're not allowed to talk about it on the Internet or mainstream news just like we need to go to the real sources to get that information you know what I'm talking about Michael Vance where's your tinfoil there's some corners of the internet where the real news is being afforded yeah very friend time these days man oh bro you don't even want to know what's on your bookmarks list let's see your open tabs right now there's some pretty funny open tabs right now I'm not gonna lie foreign blend yeah yeah let's talk about blood so blur obviously is the nft marketplace that launched earlier this year they just announced something called blend which is sort of the next evolution of nft Phi it's appeared of here nft marketplace where there's a bunch of I mean there are a bunch of features on it I think there's something that's very hard to digest about it because one of the things that it allows you to do is do buy now pay later for nfts and I a lot of people have had a very negative reaction to that myself included but like if you look at the design of this Marketplace there are actually some things that are pretty cool about it so basically it's just a it's just a Marketplace you know similar sort of to to something like Ave where you can deposit um where you can you know blenders can lend to people who want to buy nfts and only put down a small amount of collateral and there's some kind of cool mechanism design about that how that actually works and notably they don't rely on oracles for Price feeds so because these are individualized loans and it's not peer to pool or something like that uh individual lenders can set um basically the interest rate that they're comfortable lending it and the way they get around relying on an oracle is at any given time the lender can essentially trigger a Dutch option and wherein another lender can either scoop up uh the the nft at a higher interest rate or in the case that no lenders want to step in they they actually take possession of the collateral we can dig into that I think a lot of people have a lot of problems with that and see gamification there but the the other thing that I thought was kind of cool about this construction is they assume I kind of see this in an evolution in in crypto Market structure where if you have these sort of two-sided marketplaces where you're relying on liquidity in the very beginnings of like uniswap you relied on retail liquidity you know for amms and then with uni V3 kind of like well in order to create a better borrower experience right kind of the demand side of the equation really you there's more complexity that's needed to provide liquidity and they were totally okay making that bet and blend basically came out and said we are actually basing this one of the assumptions in this Marketplace working is the existence of more sophisticated lenders you can and honestly like just hearing them say that I was like that's probably the right assumption I'm actually not sure that it makes sense for retail writ large to just the market makers can contribute passive liquidity it's hard to be a market maker so this is just kind of me rambling about about this protocol but what do you guys what's your guys take on this I love that I love that blur is out here just launching a buy now pay later thing for nfts in this market like this free market of all time for crypto they're out here just doing like oh yeah buy another meanwhile buy now pay later it's like collapsing right my first reaction was that you guys should have read the room aren't they like doing a bunch of volume right now though like they have yeah well trading volume or lending volume let's see I think one of the pump some nfts like a zoo 17 000 Keith London yeah no I mean it's unwell the volumes were I would call it a successful launch also since the launch like the floors of a couple of times that have been that are like featured on blend really popped like azuki's ran up from like 15 uh 14 or 15 to like 18 um and if you if you dig into the data there's a lot of users buying a zoo keys with the buy now pay later one yep I I so Mike I I agree with all that um I think the biggest thing in my mind is kind of the only thing that's left in D5 right now is retail and like there aren't any institutions that are stepping in and Market making things there aren't any institutions that are like gonna be the initial backs off of liquidity for this ecosystem yet maybe it comes back eventually and it could be designed for that um you know eventually but I I do think that we're kind of in this place of like it's really only like crypto whales and Retail players that are in this ecosystem so like building that base of liquidity is going to be hard if they can do it that's going to be great but um yeah I also I think the 30 hour Dutch auction is tough because what that frankly means is you gotta be like paying attention can I tell you why Mike you you've spent a lot more time digging into this than I have but the reason I didn't like it was actually around their messaging I think blur is really smart and like uh Pac-Man smart and stuff um and they've clearly like Advanced the institutional nft light World in a good way and like push competitors in the right direction but they had their tweet threat announcement um there was like one of the tweets is like every I'm just gonna read it every trillion dollar market lies on financialization to scale nfts are no different instead of paying a million dollars for house buyers put a hundred thousand dollars down and pay the rest through their mortgage without this mechanism almost no one would be able to afford home so he's explaining like the mortgage market and then but like I think that's a pretty dangerous thing to do to compare massive leverage and debt positions on these extremely volatile jpegs with the purchase of a home and I think it sets this like dangerous mentality I think people are going to get wrecked on this I I do agree with that though it's just like a matter of whether it makes sense or is sustainable to lever up any asset in an attempt to buy it so like you know buying a house it sounds very sweet you know you have a family you go buy a house American Dream whatever you do that with commercial real estate you know 90 loan to value everyone stops coming to the office you know all of a sudden the portfolio is zero so like you know isn't nft more like a house or is it more like you know commercial real estate it's probably not similar to either it's probably just like internet money with a picture on it well yeah and like I think you know do these things have any fundamental value that's kind of what the entire Assumption of Levering it up is based on or maybe does it and maybe it's all just mean value and it'll come back and and it's a good way to speculate but it reminded me a little too much of like so a firm and after pen klarna are like the main buy now pay later platforms and they absolutely ripped from like 2019 to 2021 um I think there was like 2018 or 2019 there was like 2 billion in buy now pay later debt uh two years later it increased 10x to like 25 billion and if you look at the marketing of a lot of these buy now pay later programs they were like this is really good for Gig workers this is great for young people with poor credit histories this is great for the unbanked and it was like a similar kind of like I didn't like that messaging because you're kind of like preying on those folks um and it ended up completely backfiring for those people and in reality it was great because of zurp yeah you can get a zero interest loan on a mattress or like you know I I do find it interesting that financialization of pfp nfts particularly right now is what they're going after and and demands point there is no fundamental utility there is no fundamental value we created these things so far and they have value in a secondary Marketplace but it it will lead to some people you know overextending and getting burned and that frankly I think is is probably not worth going super head first into this ecosystem right now um but maybe there's enough liquidity maybe there's enough liquidity on the lending side to actually make this work that that's kind of this thing that I keep going back to so you just set up the like overall like this kind of a philosophical discussion like how much financialization is enough financial like some amount of financialization is okay and good right like to use your example Jason of like the mortgage like America had a social contract where they made a decision or owning a house is a good thing that's not the case everywhere like there are other countries where everyone just rents we were like we think it's a good thing to own your home and basically everyone should lever up and buy their home and that'll be okay so like we all kind of thought that was good but then like where's the line because now it's not small community banks that are lending to you know to people in their Community this right there's gonna be none of them left but really what happens is those are more like small distribution centers where these mortgages are originated they're packaged up and then they're sold to people in Japan and it's like well maybe that you're because you have a larger base of people that are willing to buy those mortgages you get better price but is that really a better system but yeah it's a philosophical question I mean so the two points coming out of that are number one a house is a fundamentally useful asset whether or not you live in it or somebody else does someone's going to be living in it most likely and number two the other reason why home ownership became such a American Mainstay is because overall the the residential uh housing market has gone up over the last 50 years and that became the largest asset for most families and that I think is you know if you if you don't own and you rent like you miss out on that wealth creation possibility over the last you know multiple decades so I agree there does need to be some financialization it's interesting to have it be in this ecosystem I guess maybe the point that I'm trying to make is um the messaging around it and comparing it to mortgages is to Jana's point is is not something that I thought that was bad let me make one more financial in my mind financialization equals good in my mind it unlocks a bunch of opportunities and that's fine and like if you think that nfts are just like or you either think that nfts are just tokens with pictures in which case like yeah you should financialize these tokens and then on the other side like you think that nfts of this really valuable thing that like Creator in which case yeah financialization is also good it was the messaging and um it wasn't just ad messaging too it was actually like there's this strategy that they did that I thought was like also not great where you can um they're incentivizing loans on the platform through these things called lending points that where the more lending points that you get the more the more of a the next airdrop you get and in the mortgage land which we're like if you just keep going with that analogy there's this thing called reg n regulation n that um it's known as the like mortgages acts and practices but it's the mortgage advertising rule basically and it prevents a bunch of like over over promoting and over advertising uh and like doing deceptive advertising and mortgages and to me when I read this I'm like you are incentivizing people to like do more that than they should on this platform to farm connect your job oh I agree with you but I my understanding of their point system was that they changed around so they're incentivizing the lenders not the people who want to borrow an nft by not paying later so they're incentivizing people to provide liquidity and extend credit to people who want to buy because I think they're concerned of everyone first of all either gaming like playing some kind of game where you set an unreasonably High you know um interest rate and then people default on it no one wants to pick it up they scoop it up for a reasonable price and dump it immediately that's the game that everyone has already outlined but I think what that they want to do is they want to provide a liquid Market of sophisticated lenders and those points are pushing people to you know not pull out basically and do that that was my understanding of those points yeah I mean it's the same way that they incentivize the trading of nfts as well which is you get points or whatever you put out an offer not when I buy something Mike do you feel comfortable sharing the um like what you're explaining to me about the difference between like letting you lowering on like Ave versus compound versus blur or unblend youth it was It was kind of I mean what I was trying to I think it's the look I I actually agree with everything you guys are saying I just think it's important to provide like some kind of Devil's Advocate um first I really do think like so I I like for instance I think being able to buy and sell stocks is good do I think it's great that Robin Hood basically pushes people into options because those are the highest margin products and that's what the order flow that Citadel wants to buy I don't think that's good so there's like some there's a bell curve of financialization that I think is basically you see what I did there yeah but like like I feel like this argument does not actually hold water when you just have like other examples sugar is bad for you should we allow children to drink orange juice probably not but that's like part of a balanced breakfast and also part of like the food pyramid like that's not great every asset class benefits from financialization like why shouldn't crypto like have you seen the terms of auto loans like interest rate interest only auto loans that like Jack up and and refinance to the to the you know whatever the the new interest rate that fed decides on like those are pretty toxic and poisonous and not only do you have like the industry for the loading of that give the industry for the buying of those loans and chopping those up and syndicating those to Pension funds so like I don't know I feel like crypto always gets put in this kind of like ideological corner of like you know you shouldn't be doing those things and those arguments just like never hold water if you look at the real world I I agree with that I go and you know what even as we're here because the fundamental question that we're asking is do nfts have value and if nfps have value I think we would all say then you should be able to some degree of financialization is you know right and good and acceptable to find Value like does a car yeah well you sure like I think that's the place but like what if you're like not doing anything with your life like and you're just like speculating on this car because you want a cool one I don't know I I agree the analogy and you know six to eight ounces of orange juice in the morning is is probably healthy for you but you know 60 to 80 ounces of orange juice is probably going to give you diabetes I agree I think it's kind of everything in in moderation but it is because you know when we're here sitting and saying uh is it right and good to be able to take out a loan basically to buy an nft we're like oh I don't know about that and sort of making a value judgment there but none of us question the ability to take out a load on say ethereum a Bitcoin or something like that and 99 of the world would say that's completely unacceptable level of risk and that's not right and good so do I think the marketing was a little aggressive do I think this is probably going to end in tears at some point probably do I have a philosophical problem with it no and the the other thing that we haven't even really talked about is just like close your eyes and imagine it's like a year and a half from now the mo the bull market is returning you have two options you can either buy your nft at full price or you can buy now pay later I don't it our value judgments aside people are just gonna do that yeah you have two options you can sell your nft for some asset for eth or you can borrow against your nft to get some liquidity on it like these things should exist it's just a question of you know how pervasive they need to be you're always going to have people wanting to borrow against any asset that they own I think the question is like will there be lenders for that requisite you know borrow flow and this actually makes it possible so I'm all there for expanding the use cases of crypto I feel no moral High Ground over anybody borrowing or trading or being degenerate like if you want to do that go let yourself on fire I might even lend to you to go do that but like you know it is what it is I don't see the problem just make sure you got the notifications turned on loud and yeah I'm sure you got paid your day like they'll like go on a camping trip after yeah I'm either one hours is not that long I have one more one more question on this before you guys move on so the way that buy now pay later works the modernization scheme in like e-commerce is I I don't think it's a zerpt thing Michael my understanding of the way it works is actually the you get a zero percent APR loan because merchandisers are actually subsidizing yeah at Cost because the amount like your average I forget what the unit is it's the amount that you spend on one average session or purchase or something like that goes up three or four times so yeah yeah but the the but the platforms still have to pay the full price so like the affirms you know put the money up and they borrow to be able to make that interest-free loan so that that's horrible again that got it got it um so my question to you guys would be do you think there is ever a situation where blend goes to basically charges nft collections when they do their initial Mint or drop or something like that to offer buy now pay later because just look at the impact that it's had on azuki's and miladies and punks like if I were a blend I would be like hey we can we are we've got this Market of people that are going to offer loans against your nfts and that's going to offer that's gonna result clearly in a higher floor price but we got to get a little something something I I think like the primary asset issues issuer uh facilitating leverage trading effectively of these nfts is probably a non-starter I think it's something that you'll see like the Cloak and Dagger like governance you know yeah we're gonna vote this in we're gonna you know get it going I think it's gonna be really good for projects until it's really terrible where there is no way that you can short afts right now this is probably like you know theoretically if I were to go off and and try to short nfts I would probably try to find an nft perp to Short and then I would try to immediately go off and get the spot nft whatever it might be and like literally in the in this uh like the hard part about shorting crypto is that like especially if it's a closely held coin like you can't make people give you their spot so that you can sell it into the market and you know close out your short run the perp what you have to do is you have to actually like go off and source that and horse trade and it's extremely difficult but on this like you can literally just take people's nfts so I think like you're gonna see these things pump and then you're gonna see someone smart like the GCR of nft trading who knows uh it's like a smaller cottage industry but somebody's gonna like take a shot at all of these that are that have all the student potential borrow flow that you can take and use a short so double-edged sword to say the least who's gonna be the George Soros of nfts I mean you're gonna make like a hundred dollars doing this stuff so like maybe the like never gonna be worth it but like I don't know the the peak valuations of like board API club and stuff like that like that would have been extremely juicy we had some guy in the last cycle approaching us trying to get all the Top Shot nft cards so you can short them it was like this like reiki-dink operation it like didn't end up working like this is this actually makes it possible which is pretty scary the NFC we might have had a rough year so you know they did they did but I don't know I I sort of I I kind of am with you I like I Jason I agree with you to just bring it full circle I think the way that it was marketed and something even after all this discussion by now pay later for nfts I feel pretty confident that retail's not going to be on the winning end of that but I also think you kind of have to choose like do you want a free market where people are allowed to make these decisions or do you want a market of tradify where you know it's regulated all the way up to here and this is what you're allowed to do versus not and I I kind of maybe there are people out there that have thought in much more detail about me and maybe that's a false trade-off but that's kind of what I think of um always I do think that whatever they want that's my my personal philosophy yeah same I I do think that we're gonna see a lot more uh nftx D5 financialization opportunities like there's gonna be more amms at launch there's going to be you know fungible tokens that are associated with these collections that's gonna you know get liquidity on these amms like we're gonna see a lot more financialization of nfts and frankly like broadly philosophically I I agree with all of that and yeah it just depends on how you want to approach it and who you're trying to attract yeah do you guys want to chat briefly I know I think coinbase learning is going to come out too and I want to check the results but CRV USD launched this week which was which is pretty cool so I think we covered this a little while ago when we were talking about some of the new new Stables that are getting launched so I would put go sort of in this bucket but this is kind of the convergence of a couple of different protocols that started out with separate business models but are now converging so I would put maker Dow in that camp and Ave and curve but just to like do a level set on what curve is and why they're doing this and and how it sort of makes sense is curves obviously a stable coin swap uh you know sort of like uniswap but instead of you know their kind of volatile assets they'll only do like stable coins or pairs of something that are similar in price or something like Steve to Eve and they kind of dominate that pool and they've been talking about launching a stable coin for a little while we're recording this on Friday the 4th and it looks like the first loan for a crb USD went live and the other I guess the the two things to note here is it's going to be a revenue driver for them so yeah you basically have to borrow and there's an interest rate that ends up getting paid which would be pretty good for per curve because it's an alternative Revenue stream you could also Imagine I think the reason this sort of makes sense and one of our analysts Dan Smith is super bullish on this is you can right now there's kind of there are these uh stupids the the um I'm blank on the name that that three pool basically with usdc usdt and die you could imagine a situation where a curve basically puts its own stable coin in there and what's kind of interesting is there's kind of this similar to coinbase where there's going to be the race to zero in terms of fees I think the general sentiment is that there's going to be fee compression and D5 as well if you had a pool where CRV was one of the assets that was in that pool you could drop the fees the trading fees to zero because you're earning interest income from the borrow of crb so it's kind of a way to subsidize going to going to zero cost the the other thing that's sort of cool about CRV this is a little little wonky but it's an innovation in the liquidation mechanism they have something called llama which is a little bit a a new Twist on an amm so the way that liquidations happen historically is there's an oracle and once you're you know your loan to value whatever crosses over a certain threshold then you basically just get liquidated and some serger understands that and they liquidate and there's a there's a price for doing that I my general understanding of this and I've only sort of dug in high level is that when you reach a certain like health check or health health threshold part of your possession gets sold off and it's replaced with curve that's stablecoin itself which is actually pretty interesting it's a much better user experience so you don't just like you know tick over a certain threshold in your entire position is liquidated it's a pretty cool pretty cool mechanism so that was a lot of me talking I don't know how much you guys have dug into this or what your thoughts are on this new wave of stable coins or or Kirk in general I typically my I have a really high level view of this which is that um typically been pretty bearish on these like protocol based stable coins but like when like I was kind of a ragging on Ave stablecoin go when they were when they announced it um but this one seeing how they've structured it makes me think that they're just going after maker and that they're going after die basically um and like if you I mean I've spent a lot of time in Baker and like it's a I mean I think paper I think move a bunch of things and like they've gotten like a little bit stagnant and uh there's some like key people who have left maker recently and I think curve sees like this huge opportunity to go after maker right now and that's my like zooing the multi that's what I would assume is the multi-year vision here is to go after maker I I think the liquidation mechanism is cool you are basically warehousing the risk of that liquidation within the curve stable coin itself but like it certainly would help uh and it's certainly something that maker doesn't have in the worst case scenario where instead they just start printing maker which is like really like a bad idea The Lending liquidating amm that they have yeah continuously liquidates and all this yeah but it does it piecemeal so that you don't have like you know hey maker Liquidators like everyone wake up like there's a 400 000 you know each slug hitting the market like is anybody prepared to bid and frankly when all that stuff was happening last year around like uh I think the bad ones were in June the liquidations like seeing those come down the pike of like you know there's a hundred thousand eats about it's just like how is the system gonna deal with this in a time where there is very little Trad fire liquidity very little you know retail liquidity whatever but it did work perfectly frankly there was on another Black Tuesday or whatever that incident was um that's that's because we had uh someone on the oracles uh putting the thumb on the scale I don't know if you remember that yeah I do remember that there was uh yeah there was some fortunate Oracle delays um but like not having that is good I just kind of Wonder like you know curve is now emitted a lot of its own token there's not like a ton of rewards to go around like a lot of them already being claimed by like the people who are doing the curve gauge farming like how do you bootstrap you know from zero to I think maker has what's like makers TBL 7 billion or something five billion two of that's you know usdc probably three billion of that is eth like how do you actually meaningfully take share the reason that Michael and I still use maker is because like we know that it's battle tested I don't I don't think the the appetite to put large amounts of Ethan to new code bases is super high right now so I think that's kind of my question is like how impactful is this really but yeah I mean the the curve team is is smart it you know if nothing else like they'll figure out a way to to game it effectively totally agree with all that I think the only kind of perspective that I would include um this past week we've spent uh some time with um so regulators and talking to them about you know what their priorities are especially from a crypto perspective for the next six months I think the the sentiment coming out of those conversations is there's going to be a bill that includes and and mostly features stable coins as the the primary kind of component of the regulation I I'm not saying that you know I actually agree with you know this is an interesting model the new liquidation methods are awesome it's going to be really difficult for a decentralized stable coin I think to integrate into a legal framework in the US going forward and so when we're talking about how do you break through how do you get to the size of major major already has the issue the the distribution to be able to have died in all the places that it already has it integrated you know like coinbase or any other centralized uh you know providers it just shouldn't be an echo battle I think after this bill gets released and I think the text is going to get released in the next couple of months um it should it will be difficult I think uh to be able to compete with some of the more centralized state reports unfortunately but that that's kind of the stable broad stable point perspective that you know became more apparent this week yeah I have a question this is a little in in the weeds of of curve and their whole tokonomics and everything but you know I think people initially sort of got excited by this because kind of what I was mentioning before it's a way to subsidize uh fees on some of their some of their pools and I think people generally agree it's going to be erased to the bottom the question that I have for you though is sort of curves tokenomics are sort of like Bitcoin in that you sort of need the number to go up like they they are they live and die by liquidity and the way that they direct liquidity to their pools is by emissions and what they don't they have a just like Bitcoin they have a deflationary supply schedule I think it's like every year it's like 15 lower so they want to have basically a constant amount of you know dollar denominated value that they can use to incentivize liquidity into different pools and so they that's why the the gauge and the lock rate that ve boat escrow mechanism is super important because they want to incentivize people to lock that curve up and not to go and sell it onto the open market I I feel like if they have their own sort of horse in that race then doesn't that I feel like that takes away an enormous incentive for other people to lock their curve I I'm sure I'm sure there's a really smart team I'm sure they've thought about this but I feel like it does risk destroying the Golden Goose kind of or the the long game that they're playing so I don't know if you guys have thought about that well the the thing that I have thought about independent of this uh launch is you know curve launched when was it August 2020 and if you remember the the largest lock at the time which gave you the most vote escrow curve was four years so we're coming up on a year left of where I would assume those people put their locks and so not only is it going to be hard because you've got you know less uh Supply and less incentives and number has to go up for you know those incentives to stay you're gonna have a lot of unlocking of the joking itself in in not like that long of a time so it's going to be really interesting to see how that plays out as well there's a lot of those cases like not just not just curve either like if you look at arbitraram if you look at optimism like there's going to be multi-billion dollar unlocks kind of like by early 2024 I think a lot of these are are running towards product Market fit and like token economics that makes sense before those unlocked said and frankly like my expectations of where the market is going I think that a lot of these things might Peak before the cycle itself Peaks like you're kind of early at this point if yeah your unlocks are coming in six months and you don't have things figured out like that's how I would at least uh kind of think about it yeah they're a smart team I really like the stop they ship and generally how they think about stuff so yeah no it's cool all right what do you guys wanna has uh has coin have earnings come out yet for coinbase I was just tracking I haven't seen anything maybe we could talk a little bit about um I mean I know we've talked about this before but sort of in more d-gen sort of land here we've got a Pepe coin which depending on I guess how you're allocated is the gift that keeps on giving or it's like the bane of your existence but that thing just keeps running I think the market cap on it is 700 million or something right now last time I checked and the market wants things to rip right now it just people wow people want it people want it that's what I take crazy yeah that's nuts it's really it's done a lot more than I thought it was that it was going to for sure we talked about that being an indicator I'm curious like do you do that is just kind of noise and the markets do it's gonna do you take now away from that not at all wow you need to read deeply into that stuff even though it seems so silly and yeah it says you got to pull up your 4chan account you gotta run out right here you gotta look would this would this have happened in Q Fork last year absolutely not no Q3 probably not Q2 certainly not like it's been a year since this other side I was gonna say I don't know if post Luna this happens in 2022 at all totally and like you're seeing these big LST Farms you're seeing these like L1 you know Meme coins and like there's also a reason why you don't see this on any other chain eth is dealing chain with enough liquidity for this to possibly happen um and like look at the burn today is 8 000 East burn you got 10K spent on uh East transaction fees overall today like you're probably looking at a scenario where if we get back to like four or five thousand we're gonna be breaking all-time high fee revenues pretty easily by like the start of the run and so like you know people are starting to it's not just about like the trading volume people are starting to self-organize into like these little like groups that are searching for 10 million dollar market cap meme coins and you know the hot ball of money is turning itself over and it's going round and round and like that's kind of what you need you need like a sentiment recovery and you need a credit recovery and we still haven't seen that but like we're starting to check the boxes off and like I talked to some guy who works at a different fund over the weekend and they're more of a trading fund and he was like dude like my dopamine receptors are just so shot like I need something to trade like at all times like you know Pepe's been like really like big for me it's like really really wow water like you know take a walk around the block um but I think it's big that people are starting to do this stuff and even like the nft5 stuff on on blur and blend and all that stuff like that's great too and guess what it's just burning a bunch of Youth so I'm here for it also nft5 is only an ethyl one phenomenon just for the record yep so thanks for the comments not to uh not to throw a whole wrench into this uh perspective but one idea that I was contemplating recently is okay so you know the the model is the model where one eight one five five nine you burn eath as opposed to keeping it but we're on track to burn about a million if give or take maybe even more than that over the next year what if that was distributed back I mean it's going to be more but two million two of my I think two might be too much we'll see but what if that one to two million eighth was distributed back to Staters that would immediately put the staking rate somewhere in the like High Teens I think based on 15 being state right now um kind of an interesting concept of increasing the staking rate uh instead of you know burning it and having it be deflationary I think we're going to see major discussions on this I I listened to uh Anthony sassano's daily podcast like basically every day but uh he it's kind of like a good temperature you know thermometer for like what the eth core devs are thinking and he would like you know he's thrown out a few like different tidbits over over the past like a couple months one is like two your point is like it's 80 20 right now in terms of what gets burnt versus what gets given to stakers should it be 2080. so that was like one interesting one the second one was a cap on the amount of eth that's allowed to be staked to maintain a minimum apy so that's another and then the third is um like the the formula for the actual inflation is the square root of I don't know it's just some math that I I don't have on on hand right now but it's pretty complicated and he his thought process is like you know should that be higher or should it be lower or should the equation be different it's like the square root of some number and I'm sure it has mathematical significance but it doesn't mean anything to me and so like you know I think those are going to be interesting uh Concepts to go through especially over time because like what happens if each scales 100x you know and fees don't scale 100x like we're gonna need to start making changes and like there's a long road map for ethereum we're gonna be at this for probably the next five years you know building the protocol tweaking the economics I don't think we've seen the last in terms of like youth economics and the potential changes to go in there coinbase earnings are we gonna make it I like the song but I can't even get my hands nah what happened oh nice Revenue beat not surprising given the the volatility in the quarter Jesus carvana shares jump I mean the block did well coinbase did well doordash didn't do well sorry the block Shopify way up watch yourself ends what did uh wait what what outside of the so it was a beat on Revenue how'd they do on um trying to find it on their site yeah and try to find it too you know Revenue a little short on trading volume you know could you share your screen I decided to coin this revenue on Twitter and I'm scrolling through all the Watchers we're at the point of the market where it's only like The Watcher group all right I got it I got it I got it all right now Mike gets to share the screen here one sec I haven't looked at this yet but I'm gonna share all right so I mean at first glance this looks a lot better on the so net revenue came in at 700 by 6 million only a loss of 79 which is huge and on like you know humanly talk that's amazing I mean there's a huge head count reduction and it didn't show up immediately because there's Severance and stuff that you have to pay but I'm sure some of that well wait so sorry go back go back um the biggest number there is the adjusted ebitda yeah 284 a.m that looks yeah they got a lot a lot of this is non-cash cost yeah man I My Hope Is that when all these tech companies you know when interest rates get low again and they really re-accelerate like I just hope they don't hire all these people back like just like learn your lesson like no no more like yoga and smoothies just like run a profitable business yeah wow bad bad take on my part with the institutional yeah atrocious so instead I mean but to your credit I mean it's not like it it didn't you know it's been 15 or 22. so it's like basically their their biggest real source of Revenue outside of transactions look at that interest income baby bill thank j-pal yeah I was in the set yeah I mean so blockchain rewards makes sense because eth is up in price yes I would imagine that this jumps a lot more in Q2 thank you yeah I would guess so too you know I one thing that I've been surprised about not to distract this too much is you know CB eth was one of the big liquid staking providers that enabled withdrawals post chappella and they've lost market share since then it's been like they're down something like two percent and rocketpool has been crushing it they had their Aura upgrade I guess and that's actually made a pretty big difference um but yeah I think Lido and rocketpool and and frax were basically the the big Winners and I don't really know why I mean basically just slido but the other two or three are cool also but you know like you know the amount of like I was having like 20 30 40 000 each day it's like it's cool that rocketpool added 3 000 you know two days ago but like time to pick up I mean the market shows up I know it's always easy you bet on the incumbent or whatever but like it is very hard to hold like 70 plus market share for a long period of time I think it's a tough thing I'm not advocating for whatever I mean I like rock and roll I actually think the aura upgrade is super interesting but um I think yeah I think the long tail of lsts is going to be a major narrative I've said this before on this on this podcast but it's in the LST summer in my mind because you've got I agree with that you've got like five to seven you know very very small at this point uh lsts that I think are going to grow relative in size and there's going to be all this infrastructure built around like indexes for lsts and you're gonna have like liquidity pools or lsds I think it's going to be interesting to see you know how material they become but my dad says that's gonna be a big narrative yeah I mean the liquid staking category just liquid staking just past dex's in terms of total value locked from the fourth grade and like now all the lsts are gonna be in short order the eat asset that is put into all these dexes like I that's why I kind of like frax is like an interesting model albeit much smaller it's like it just kind of internalizes all of the endogenous yield that exists because of the lsts on the other stable coin I'm sure they're going to build their own decks and like you can do that I think the the question is like will The Regulators ever like just you know say nope and like kind of put a stop to it um but it like these things have a ton of different Avenues to capture value and so to Michael's point I do think there will be some of them that you know like as much as I hate this there will be like a magic internet money liquid staking token like you know like frogmation rise up against the evil Venture capitalists and who knows if it ends well or not but that will definitely be a narrative so coin the stock is up like three and a half yeah not a ton not a ton I think a lot of people expected this type of an outcome I agree and I think they they want to hear what Brian and crew have to say about regulation I think it's going to be relatively large once again I'm I like doubling down I I think that we're gonna get some taxed in the next two to three months it's gonna be something that's sensible seem to be bipartisan in the house and then it's just to be a question of whether or not it can get through the Senate uh yeah no you asked earlier about the analysts not asking about base do you think that coinbase wants the analyst to understand base at this point ask about the analyst not asking about bass I thought you'd mention at the beginning of this like that was part of the you know oh oh I see what you're saying um do I think that coinbase does it actively doesn't want Wall Street analysts to understand base there is that thing I'm asking you this isn't this isn't a Michael bolito original bottom sort of borrowing this from someone who planted this idea in my brain I don't want to blow up a spot it's uh is I you know the one negative potential downside of bass is it might end up drawing a lot of scrutiny to what's going on in centralized sequencer land on the roll-up layer and I'm not really sure if you want that many eyeballs on that frankly um like you know if you don't I don't think yeah sequence yeah it starts you know kind of close that's the thing regulation like some of it's gonna be good some of it's gonna be like you can't do that anymore yeah right it'll be black and white some things will be white some things will be black but I do think like one of the things that I think there so there's gonna be two things that come out of this number one uh what so that's number one uh how do you go from being a security to a commodity is going to be an interesting thing that gets divined the other one is what is decentralized mean is it you know five nodes three nodes 21 nodes who knows I've I don't think I can share this now I'll tell you because after we've done before we can do a lame podcasting to say but there's a new the new uh there's a new L2 coming from like a big company and uh Hallie I think I think we're gonna start seeing a lot of a lot of a lot more like bass like things launch where companies are like oh damn smart idea uh let me go launch an L2 with one with a fully centralized sequencer all right sounds good dad I mean if you have money transmitter licenses have at it I think coinbase I agree there's many such States you know it is funny sometimes where I often our own little crypto land during mechanism design and stuff like that and I've been getting pretty deep into the weeds and at Mev this season I saw this take from this guy on Twitter a set of race ET ceteris parboost I can't find the tweet I was just looking for it but it was like the unpopular opinion but Mev is going to be solved in an off-chain way it's called going to jail I I kind of agree with him it's like yeah dude like what's all this mechanism designed for preventing sandwiches like you go to jail that's called front running that we got a law about that had so we've seen a few big uh MAV players stop doing it over the past couple weeks not gonna name anything wow they're they're like the lar they were the largest block Builders um and just like well-known try to find names and they just stopped um and they've stopped doing some forms of Mev but have continued doing others and so like from the outside looking in it feels like a lawyer got to them and was like some of this is not okay to be doing that's amazing the the other piece of news that happened this week was um Nate from openc officially charged man yeah I saw that what do you guys what do you guys think of this I mean he did something wrong I think that's clear and like you know you shouldn't do that stuff in general um I think just reading through the the Financial Times article like the sentence is like you know maximum of 40 years like does the punishment fit the crime he made yeah 50 000 he hasn't been sentenced um right but I like I've met him once I think Michael might have as well he seemed like a pretty like nerdy but nice guy um and yeah I mean it's obviously illegal to do that but it was such a small amount that going to jail for 40 years feels like uh just like a lot for that type of violation I mean he he got convicted a fraud which is a felony no matter what the sentence is like that that is that's that's tough I think he also went to court at like probably the worst time sentiment wise for crypto exactly you're not gonna get the benefit of the doubt with with General antibody yeah I think he I I think he goes to jail for less than a year gets probation in a fine but he still has a felony on his record which sucks yeah and like dude I think I do think what he did like you're the the definition of insider trading is pretty clear like you're the head of a pro of a product for a Marketplace there's a level of responsibility that comes with that title and in that role you know exactly what's going on and and you know what you're doing there so therefore I think what he did was wrong I think the punishment is wild and fair and I think both can be correct and I also think that the Regulators here are looking in like they're so the wrong direction here they're like going after this 50k thing or 62 however much it was and like meanwhile there's a bunch of other stuff they should be looking at oh yeah you know what it's not big I think he's just we should you know no commenting on like what he actually did which whatever but I think it's just important to have some empathy like everyone knows his name now and that he did this and I think that's because to be honest okay like the jail will would definitely suck the felony if he works in crypto I'm not really sure that impacts his job prospects to be completely honest with you but I I you know when I do come on Mike are you gonna hire him yeah uh wow Fair points I don't know I've met the guy but I just I don't know I think it does suck to have your name just like splashed all over like that and to be the poster boy because that's when he is like the poster and that just sucks yeah that really sucks he's gonna have on that time you think about you know just that one click of the the mouse I I think it was more I think it was more than one but yeah there was a few he was a repeat offender but yeah I don't do don't do that this isn't just nft Land by the way like there was a there's this um this uh woman named Ann Herbert I think it was she was a Nike employee for 25 years and she was um I think she was flipping Nikes on the secondary based on like because she had access to the memos that the CEO was gonna send out I'm probably getting the story really wrong but she got fired and I think she might face some time like that's illegal and she was selling them on uh on stockx or something like that if it feels like it's an unfair Advantage don't do it yeah yeah yeah always speaking of unfair advantages blockworks launched gov Hub this week which is the most powerful governance platform in crypto so there's new one unfair advantage in governance if you own governance tokens you should subscribe to blockworks research always be selling so are you guys just going to be like massive delegates yeah we're going to be delegates yeah wow okay we got some totians we might delegate to you every crypto Venture firm cannot be a dele cannot be active in governance right now um and uh we got you there's a certain amount of vet I mean our analysts they only check they only like keep up to date with like three create three protocols at a time like they are so in the weeds for this stuff like they're they're the ones that you'd want to delegate to so don't govern too hard you and Nate might be seeing each other at some point all right just uh just to end this on a more uplifting note like a funny story of the week I don't know if you saw that uh PornHub pulled out of Utah do you guys see this cool I I saw the headline because of the kyc stuff so PornHub why do you think Vance just left Utah the guy was there for like six weeks show us your tabs show us the tabs all right everyone hope you have a good uh good rest of your week good Friday and I'll see you guys next week six
