views of any organization with which the co-hosts are associated with uh nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as Financial technical tax legal or other advice you know the deal now let's jump into the episode all right everyone welcome back to another Roundup of bell curve you got Michael's one and two Vance and we've dropped the dead weight so it's just three of us this week I'm just kidding yeah I love you buddy that doesn't eat Denver he's holding down the fort do you guys send people down there or do you do you feel tempted to go to these things yourself we're usually at these things we sent a couple of our people there but east Denver's a a fan favorite it's a classic um in in the last one before the pandemic I think it was literally held in like a parking garage that was like astroturfed it's just like a great Builder conference but could make it this year hopefully next year it's a Vibe are there with 30 000 people registered pretty nuts and and from what I hear just on Twitter the vibe is very positive there's a lot of people interested in ZK there's a lot of people interested in l2s D5 games you know it's just great when you go to those conferences and you just get a re renewed sense of vigor in the industry and and just like the sense that you know it's not just you and 15 people on crypto Twitter it's it's actually a real industry like actual people doing this yeah I'm with you I think the biggest one for us I don't know if you agree with his fans but the biggest one the one that we had the first experience of that feeling was Devcon no this is in 2019 before we knew you mate uh Devcon I think it was six in Osaka uh where you literally had like 5 000 people all talking about ethereum all talking about D5 all the different announcements that were happening and then you've got vitalik in like 20 of the core devs with these massive Japanese dancers and drums on stage and like it was it was one of those where you're like I don't know what I just saw but it was definitely interesting and I feel like there's something happening here well the big news of the week is that uh fellas we're going bankless we are going going bankless not the way we thought it was going to go but here we are um now we're talking about let's talk about silvergate because that's actually relatively big news so I mean the the title of the story is that Silver Gate was due to file its 10K on Wednesday so we're recording this Thursday the day after and they said that they have failed to file so Shares are down I think at the time of recording it sound about 45 turns out Wall Street doesn't love it when you don't file your 10K um just to like give a history I think we've talked about silvergate a little bit on this show but so Brigade you know they were a traditional bank right kind of like a local Regional like a local Regional Bank and then they started getting into crypto around Circa I think like 2014 2015. they a couple things to know like first over time the their depositors I think as of end of 2022 it's like 90 crypto firms right so that actually creates a little bit of a risk from a deposit standpoint the other thing to know about silvergate is that they've built out very impactful and highly used uh infrastructure especially in the exchange side of things they have something called the send Network and that's how all of these kind of market makers and exchanges all talk to each other in after hours trading and they can send and deposit uh you know US dollars so you know it's been kind of widely reported on that they struggled near the end of last year they had an enormous kind of bank run which they processed by selling uh their debt Securities which is they're basically holding all those deposits and treasuries in almost any year that would be totally fine the problem was it was like the worst year for Bonds in a couple hundred years in the U.S so I think the Wall Street Journal they reported that they lost about 718 million dollars um and apparently it's just getting worse this year so uh and then I guess the last bit of news to note there is that there have been a couple tweets uh you know coinbase uh basically tweeted that they were no longer doing business with with silvergate and it's looking pretty bleak at least as of today I'm not sure what do you guys think it's kind of like the classic Bank Run scenario where just the trust is broken down and people are now pulling deposits they're cutting relationships they're curtailing whatever activities they have ongoing with Will with silvergate and silvergate is primarily the main transaction bank for crypto what that means is that when you actually withdraw money um from coinbase they're actually sending it to your bank account from silvergate um and now signature is going to be that player and you know silvergate's a smaller Bank um they're as of today a 300 million dollar market cap Bank signature is about six and a half or seven billion right now and so like the amount of concentration risk that they had within their crypto depositor section was gigantic and you know this is the risk of of that type of concentration risk the other thing that we've we've looked at and you know this is not like the fixed income group of framework speaking this is like Michael and I who don't have a ton of experience in looking at Banks just like reading the tea leaves on what we're seeing you know it looks like they took all of their crypto deposits put it in you know pretty long duration credit and then got worked on that once rates rised in Arthur Hayes put out a tweet today that said really all you needed to do was take USD deposits from crypto firms buy a super short duration or at least like mixed duration credit and then you know not get blown up or have to be a four seller when rates rise uh just because you have a little bit more duration diversity in your book that does not appear to be what they did it appears to be the exact opposite where they just took massive concentration risk and very long dated stuff and then got blown out so I don't know actually how mechanically an insolvency of a bank like silvergate would work I don't even know if they're there yet and they have an issue to going concern warning yet they issued a warning that they might issue a warning of being a going concern but it's certainly not looking great the thing that advantages mentioned was the thing that I was going to double click into which is they didn't file their 10K uh which is their annual report they paused and they said that they would be filing it shortly but it has something in it that they are concerned about the potential for going concern in the next 12 months which means that they need to be able to work out some of the risk factors they need to work out some of the disclosures they need to basically spend time with lawyers and bankers to say what is actually something that we can recently put forward and sign our names on the dotted line to say these are the reasonable risks these are the reasonable disclosures that we have to make to all potential shareholders and and so the the market is reacting to that as van said it's down you know whatever percent today I haven't checked it in a few hours but it was down 30 after hours yesterday um broadly speaking though you know that it it will be interesting to see like do they actually have issues withdrawn do they actually have issues with you know liquidity um there is a difference between something getting oversold and an actual insolvency uh it's not like the bank is you know Luna and it's propping up its customer deposits with its Equity like that that doesn't necessarily that that's not how Banks work uh regulated banks that is um so there is there is something to that uh it's just a question of how money how much loss can they take before you know they they become truly underwater um so that that's kind of like the big question mark I would say that needs to be resolved I don't really know how this works either but you know this is silvergate has been I think actually going into Tuesday or Wednesday it was the most shorted stock in the US it was like 81 of its shares were sold short and there's something when there's some kind of rule where if if the auditor is sort of presented with I forget there's a very specific kind of legal term for what it is then they have to investigate so Elizabeth Warren has kind of specifically singled out silvergate Mark kahodis you know I've seen him on on Twitter kind of giving interviews he's a pretty well-known short seller um is a lot of concern I mean I'm with you in the sense it's very far cry from Luna but not filing a 10K is definitely it's probably cause for legitimate concern there Elizabeth Warren put out a letter today about this you know like she's calling this out directly um and you know the at least the the thought is that there's a lot of people who have as you said 81 short interest a financial interest in this thing going down um so I I I don't know where the where the block stops or like where this thing ends but I do think that there are a lot of incentivized parties on both sides here two other things I think are are important so microstrategy is a large counterparty of silvergate and they put out a tweet today that says we have a loan from silvergate not due until q1 2025 their Market concerns re silvergate for anyone wondering the loan wouldn't accelerate because of Si insolvency or bankruptcy our BTC collateral is in custody with silvergate so it's not like they have a bunch of um they definitely have a lot of credit exposure to the industry but the industry doesn't really have a ton of collateral exposure to silvergate it does have implications where it's going to be harder to withdraw my money may be harder to do create redeem with with things like usdc but this is not like a death spiral scenario for really anyone other than silvergate if they have gotten blown out as bad as you know some people are saying um so that's one thing I think the other one that I was watching a few weeks ago is you had this weird uh Motley Crew of characters getting on both sides of silvergate you had Brendan Bloomer as a I think like a nine percent shareholder you had block one as a nine percent shareholder and then you had like Citadel and black Citadel and yeah yeah and you had like you know a couple other of the big boys um and there's certain rules about owning shares of a bank where if you cross seven and a half percent or something like that like you like I don't know the exact regulations I'm paraphrasing here but like you might also become a bank in terms of your reporting requirements and that's like not fun for anybody so it's not like you can have like block one double or triple their ownership like you're kind of capped on on in terms of like the offensive side of silvergate on like the other side of silvergate you had George Soros and his fund shorting it and so you had kind of like these two camps lining up against each other and this is when silvergate was at like 15. it's uh it was just weird to see that you don't really ever see that um especially with tradify people taking stances in crypto it was interesting but it looks so far like the Soros side is winning you know to address kind of the you know to maybe like stand up for silvergate a little bit here I you know I I also read that Arthur Hayes tweet generally when I see people like kind of making those tweets from the cheap seats it's like okay dude you know you you weren't actually in a position to run that bank like there was probably a really good reason why that was the case you know um but thanks for the input so I that was kind of my reaction to that to be honest uh I I also think my read on silvergate this is totally an anecdote so take that for what it's worth but I've interacted with that team pretty frequently they always came off as pretty professional and like they knew what they were doing and like to your you know to your point Vance about these sort of people kind of lining up and and then taking individual sides I mean sometimes you know uh companies are the casualty of these powerful shareholders who have these own weird battles right and definitely silvergate I think is they probably made some mistakes but I think they're getting caught up in something that's a little bit bigger than themselves the the last point I want to make about this is silvergate is one of those companies where you guys probably heard this a lot in crypto uh we invest in picks and shovels businesses right and those are supposed to be less risky than the underlying assets they're based off go take a look at where silvergate has landed relative to its all-time high and then go look at how Bitcoin and eth have done from their all-time highs it's just that's just not how it works it's not how it plays out it's like that that whole picks and shovels oh yeah like the regulated businesses of crypto those are like catnip to like growth investors in Silicon Valley people and like just take a step back and think about the lived experience of those investors over the past 12 months where they were like yeah crypto's coming but we're going to regulate it and we're gonna be the good guys and then like Fast Forward 12 months it's like you invested in dcg you invested in FTX you invested in silvergate you invested in even frankly coinbase like all of these things have just gotten completely worked versus Ethan Bitcoin which are honestly not doing that bad relative so it's unfortunate like in Ethan Bitcoin aren't bad but like all of the incentives now are for the traditional VCS not to allocate to these regulated plays and for everyone else to go the exact opposite direction offshore or decentralized you know and decentralized is good and bad but that's the way the winds are blowing at the moment the the other like the we've kind of talked about like this broadly as being called like operation choke point at least by people in crypto there was also kind of Rumblings from signature so there's an announcement from Kraken that they were going to be limiting transactions of certain sizes from uh from signature and signature and Silver Gate are two very systemically important banks for crypto they're kind of these smaller banks that really leaned in and offered banking services to like the exchanges and the funds and kind of the cap the C5 infrastructure that powers a lot of crypto or regulated crypto based out of the US and that's coming under a significant duress which probably poses a lot of real challenges for for big companies in in crypto I just speak curious how much of a worry is this overall for the industry and then I guess yeah I mean Vance you were just saying this kind of pushes people out that is the incentive for Founders and companies right why would you want a domicile in the United States right now given this given this environment I think there's two things there there's creating the on-ramps and off-ramps and having that be something that is a stable and reliable solution silvergate has been one I mean with their sen Network that was uh or the silver data exchange Network that that was something that you know was probably the most widely used rails to move money around in the crypto space um even though it wasn't even crypto rails um signature has been probably the number two in terms of notoriety of which banks support crypto and and there's only probably one or two maybe three others other than that that will take you on as a as a customer as a client if you have anything related to to crypto and in what you're doing um anecdotally I've heard of a couple of friends you know one who was starting a new fund one who is working on a new project and they're having a difficult time getting banking banking services and it's not going to be impossible but it's just taking a really long time it's unclear as to you know who they have to talk to the the kyc partner the the different hoops and ladders that they have to go through to get this bank account just so that they can put the money that has already been you know committed to them to they can pay people salaries like the the the operation show point I think I don't think that it's a concerted effort and and I think it's really you know coincidental that all of this is happening at the same time uh but I do think that you know it is it is serious if we lose the rails I don't think we're going to lose the rails in totality we may lose access to certain rails but I think there's just going to be others that are going to step in and fill that Gap and I can't remember if it was the OCC or if it was the FED who put out a note um maybe a week or two ago as all of this was happening there was sort of a rumor that operation showpoint was happening I I think it was the FED who said it's not illegal to bank crypto companies you know like crypto companies are fine and it's up to the same standards of kyc and her mother into that money laundering band secrecy act violations like those are the things that they care about you know we we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater uh and you know these are not two in the same so I I think that there is a movement to not cut off an entire industry from the banking industry and there's a desire to not let that happen there just has to be Clarity and frankly I think this is you know one of those things that I think most more than likely will blow over eventually uh but it will be something that you know drags for a bit but it's not going to kill anything I I would I would agree with that too I think it's just uh and you know to to sort of take the perspective of an outsider I can I can see the perspective of what did you guys expect you know we definitely have some sins to atone four as an industry it sucks I mean SBF was definitely that this is probably blowback from from SPF I can always be anecdote I went down to DC two times and the first time I went down was right after SPF and everyone was kind of uh you know this happens and we know that fraud happens and this doesn't necessarily reflect on the industry then I went down a second time and it was kind of like actually we're a little pissed it was sort of the vibe so you know this is just this is sort of the natural way that things go and there's always going to be some blowback and this too shall pass I think is the way I think about it ultimately I think it's for the better like this still is a huge prize to bank this industry to be the bank of stablecoin creation Redemption to be the bank that does the internet work transfers um I think this stuff is like you know getting exposed to like a cold every once in a while just makes your immune system stronger that's kind of what you need you don't really want to get hit with like something out of the blue and not be able to handle it at scale like do I think silvergate Bank was the banking partner of the future for crypto honestly probably not I'm hoping that like JP Morgan Bank of America you know one of the large retail depository institutions steps up um signature big bank is frankly like a step in the right direction it's 20 times the size it doesn't have the same customer concentration risk frankly it probably has better management so you know I can see the Silver Lining um this is like a year of a lot of Silver Linings like yes there's a huge dark ominous Cloud but like look like there's a rainbow behind that and you have to squint to see it it might not actually be there but like you know you have to take it for what it's worth one of the one of the things we keep on saying internally but also with portfolio companies is like this is a year of Ben don't break you know it's gonna be a tough year there's gonna be a lot of that we have to deal with but we're not going to break and we're just going to continue forward I agree I agree I think the toughest part about silvergates they had a bald CEO so suddenly that just doesn't work as an indicator anymore the whole thesis what else can we trust yeah it's the year of air year of air my friends look at what's going on the lettuce good Lord oh boy oh boy all right let's uh let's move past this I I want to talk about this is kind of a cool story uh and doing a little bit of a showing our own book because block Works broke it but uh there was a counter exploit on uh the Wormhole situation so basically the background is is that uh I mean Wormhole was was hacked um a while ago for for a pretty large number hidden jump kind of stepped in and backstopped it one of our analysts Dan Smith so credit to Dan was just as one does just analyzing uh wraps wraps the transfers uh noticed a huge as one does on a on like a Friday night he was doing this at like 3am uh with a psycho uh but he noticed a 220 million dollar transfer which is obviously a gigantic outlier um and there's a there's a whole he kind of traced everything out how they actually did this it was very clever um and it's frankly beyond my uh my five-year-old brain so we'll link the the free report of how it actually happened in in the show notes but it was kind of a sophisticated counter exploit that was that was leveraged on something called Oasis thou um and after this all came out Oasis announced that they received quote an order from the high court of England and Wales to take all necessary steps that would result in the retrieval of certain assets involved with the wallet address associated with a wormhole exploit so part of this was some pretty sophisticated Financial engineering and know-how from the jump team but there was definitely a legal black channel that was involved as well and Oasis basically said hey we had to comply essentially so there were a couple takes from from the more idealistic uh corners of D5 which was hey this is a betrayal of the promise of defy I'd be curious just what you guys thought about the whole exploit and then if if that Rings true at all Oasis and maker now are not the same thing and not to get too into the details here but like when you do a maker Vault you are putting up your drawing die um it's totally permissionless no one can take your position alter it um that's one thing Oasis is entirely another Oasis in the US actually used to have a broker dealer license way back in the day people I either forgot about this or didn't know about it but like that's a centralized company and the UI that Oasis offers you if you're going to open a maker vault is you know you open it through them and it is through a different smart contract but you have all these different bugs and or bells and whistles that you can put on the contract itself do you want to multiply your leverage do you want to add a trailing stop loss do you wanna you know have a like an Auto Liquidation price that's arbitrary like you can do all of that different stuff and what's funny is that I think that the thing that caused the uh Oasis contract to be able to be exploited um on whoever stole the eth's behalf was the fact that they used a trailing stop loss when they were trying to lever up a rap steath position and you know what's the moral of the story there you know Pros don't use Hedges I think it's the first one um the second one is just like that's framework compliance approved yeah that's not true don't the not Financial advice being sarcastic but the fact that they used to centralize intermediary to put these additional things on their smart contract was eventually they're undoing and I don't think anybody ever made the promise of crypto not you know extending to centralized institutions like that's not the thing that we're going after here and so I wasn't surprised I do hear the pushback from everybody on crypto Twitter about how this was you know not a good thing generally but what else were they supposed to do like if your thing is not permissionless there really isn't much you can do if a court orders you to do it right and and just to be clear I think the the hack wasn't I don't know if it was necessarily a hack I think it was more of a an open exploit that existed actually for a while where there was the ability to upgrade the contracts and in the process of upgrading you could change or retrieve assets um with the admin key in particular so you were basically putting your trust in Oasis uh the centralized wrapper on top of the major protocol and and just to like Hammer this point home there were a lot of instances where you've got centralized intermediaries that sit on top of decentralized protocols and I frankly think like that is the future of what D5 ultimately looks like but don't think that just because you're using something that happens to look and feel like web3 it's completely decentralized to a point of not being upgradable not being exploitable not being redeemable whatever it may be um and so I think this is a good lesson for all users of D5 obviously the video relapse of you know the the people on Twitter that are claiming you know this this is exactly why D5 isn't D5 um whatever uh but but frankly I think um this is good because now we can actually have some retribution for a really large hack that happened and um I think we can close the loop on whether or not these Oasis uh contracts are are upgradeable or not I think they they cut that capability so you know it's it's a one-time situation for them and you know nothing really is you know that much different other than the person who stole a bunch of money got the money stolen back so people rooting for North Korea are just idiots in my opinion like oh how could you like D5 is supposed to be unsensible it's like yes this was a one-time exploit and we took money away from North Korea I don't see it being bad necessarily I don't know yeah was the Wormhole hack officially Lazarus I'm just assuming anything over it like there's so few people that are sophisticated enough to do this I like the the thing that was funny was like they started Levering that's what the youth the maker of all for they started Levering up and buying Maurice at that point I was like oh maybe maybe not so bad but it's like no like we we can't let them do that like we should have some sort of checks and balances in the system even if it has to go to a court unless they bought like a ton of eth then it would be and then we would have something to talk about it of course no obviously yeah yeah supreme Supreme Leader he doesn't have a butthole I don't know what you're talking about Adam's watching this Lego god um yeah I'm kind of I'm kind of with you I there has to be I mean this is I I do think I've heard Nick Carter say this and I kind of agree with it we're we're in the span of time right now where all these systems are being battle tested and we're trying to get a sense of like where does decentralization really need to be and and what are just I get that it's really good from an ideological standpoint for it to have all of it be completely uncensorable and unseasonable but I don't know we live in a society you know so where's like the pragmatic like where does this really where do those lines really fall so I think that's all going to get tested and we can opine on it but probably the market and governments and society's just gonna come to a consensus on what they find is an acceptable compromise I mean think about how many how many implementations of eth exist how many client teams exist think about how many different apps are built on top of uniswap think about how many apps are built on top of maker or any of the default protocols like this stuff is going to get figured out I think this is just a great example of where points of decentralization maybe need to exist or or maybe not and and maybe this is the right outcome because now we have the ability to say okay let's put levels of security around this I don't know I I ultimately think this is a really good thing small tangent have you heard about some of the these rules around renters rights in cities no this is no but I heard it's horrible in California oh it's pretty funny like literally a renter can take your your apartment that you may own and you're renting out hostage if they've been there for a certain amount of time refuse to pay rent and then and then declare that you need to pay them to leave and there's nothing that anybody can do San Francisco is a little different man it's a whole other ball game out here actually this is this is an LA Story uh of a friend who has a house and it has two condos in it and literally one of them is being seized by the tenant what is the Steel Man case though for why it's a good idea that that tenant law exists I'm sure there's some kind of rationale why does that exist like that there's there's all these like I mean it only got worse with kovid but like there's all these um like owner move-in and like um all of the like like safe eviction rules that exist I I know in San Francisco there's those and I think in most cities in California there's some derivation of that where like if you are the owner of an apartment you're only allowed to kick somebody out if you move in and stay there for five years and if you are found out to not be living there for less than five years like the the previous tenant can sue you like there's just like all these you know it's supposed to protect people who have been there for a long time and and you know they they don't have any ability to move and maybe the prices have gone up and they're locked into these rates because there's you know there there's a rent control um on certain buildings ultimately for anybody who's taken a basic economics class you realize that these are inefficiencies in the market and they ultimately have deterious effects on the entire housing market depending on which way they're built so obviously not a fan I I cannot maybe understand why someone put that in at one point for like human protection and like social value but uh the free market is free market and it says otherwise it's like these people don't believe in capitalism what a shame you know what honestly I said this joke but I think there is a growing portion of people out there especially gen Z that straight up does not uh subscribe to capitalism they're just like nope often out of that but yeah the ones that uh have lived at home until they went to college and then just graduated those ones Cuba is really close if you want to try the alternative I can get you there fast I'm just saying scoreboard for capitalism looks pretty good compared to the Alternatives of what I would float out there but who knows let's just blame it on the Boomers that's that's much easier Let's uh let's uh you know at risk of going outside of Bounce bar podcast here let's talk about Cosmos uh they're ditching uh ICS um so basically the this was reported a little while ago so basically Cosmos needs a native stable coin they had one in the form of UST rip that is no longer the case um there are a couple other kind of Alternatives that have been suggested but basically Circle announced in September of last year that usdc would launch natively um and then we got a little bit more detail that there was going to be a general asset issuance chain called Noble and that is was going to be distributed through the Hub so the Hub has frankly it has a little bit of an identity crisis but it does a couple things uh it's kind of like a router for for messaging in between these these protocols but also there's with the Advent of atom 2.0 there's this sort of shared security model where the Hub can kind of rent out their validator set to commercial chains and that's what this was going to be but now that is that is no longer the case they're going to launch as a standalone proof of authority chain instead of utilizing security from The Hub so I'm curious what you guys what you guys think about this I just honestly feel like Cosmos has missed its window etherolapse are scaling they're getting user traction they have stable coins um the fact that this is launching is a POA chain Noble is versus using ICS like a huge hit to Value accrual of the chain itself but I don't know like for for me at least I don't know what Michael thinks like Cosmos oftentimes feels like the purest form of of like the PVP meme where it's like you know instead of everyone having their own decks now everyone has their own chain and there's like five dollars of liquidity and it's like the same 10 people passing like one dollar back and forth trying to make it into two dollars it just doesn't feel like it has the activation energy required to really make it a thing and maybe that changes with dydx um but I don't know dydx is is even less of uh like the whole dydx value prop used to be it's on Stark where it's super fast it's the only place you can trade perps and that was true just like the latency of the other chains was not low enough where you could have an oracle updating to run a purpose exchange on it anywhere else but now that isn't the case the l2s are fast enough they're cheap enough um so I would be surprised if it had a resurgence frankly I'm just like not that big of a fan yeah I mean uh I generally agree with all that I I would say I don't know if they've missed their window or if they've just been like hamstrung by like Tara blowing up like they they had their stable coin but you know the the thing that matters most for an ecosystem especially when you're developing anything that's going to have Financial Primitives or D5 or even like value transfer you got to have a native stable coin and if you don't have that there's really no form of application I think that's super interesting uh the second that you have to bridge it's going to become too cumbersome for user adoption um the second that you like have to trust in um you know another entity to be able to have something that you can really feel you can get access to I mean we're talking about the choke points of banks right now for usdc and and particularly usdc on on eth you know what happens if there's there's choke points that break on getting your your stable coins from one network to the other um so I think that there's just a lot of trust that you have to put in that especially for something that doesn't have the Lindy effect as everything else has and has been building for the last couple of years um that being said you know if Noble can develop a sustainable you know I'm guessing that Circle would just put usdc into Cosmos via Noble chain um if they can develop that trusted relationship you know maybe that's a good opportunity for Noble and and you can kind of speed run the opportunity knowing that you're going to have the exact same Playbook is usdc on any other network um it will I think be interesting to say okay let's say do idx is going to use this usdc like are are they going to use it are they going to have to you know have a bunch of different others on there like is it going to be another stablecoin Wars you know playing out in real time just in a new ecosystem I feel like the the more harm and the more competition you have going into you know the the rollout of this this uh this new ecosystem is uh the noble ecosystem is that frankly you just have to have something win and win big quickly uh to catch up to everybody else I will take the other side of this a little bit um I because I like I like the people in Cosmos ecosystem and I think they think about things in like a fundamentally different way so the way that I would distinguish kind of what's going on in ethereum land and the challenges and problems that they're really interested in solving versus what's going on in Cosmos land is Cosmos has from day one been like extremely honed in on kind of like the application layer right like they solve a lot of problems from the perspective of like kind of app developers whereas ethereum I think is very concerned with kind of like the modular kind of scaling infrastructure like uh data availability uh validity proofs all that kind of stuff right and like they got like the ZK kind of um came from from ethereum land but I think the they're just very focused on solving a different set of problems I think if they could get you're right the the native stable coin the ability to take out leverage like there's a lot of really cool Innovation going on over there um The Hub just needs to figure out what they're doing they're lack they lack the value cruel that's the I think the challenge I think it's something that could be overcome but yeah so the value the value cruel is a major component of it as well but the the thing that you know Advanced kind of mentioned this but I'll just I'll say it again uh The Narrative of basically app chains that are built around IBC and the cosmos ecosystem and and the tech stack that is Cosmos are being speedrun sped run right now by supernets and subnets where you've got the same level of scale you have the same opportunity you've got very Business Development heavy ecosystems in polygon and Avalanche and they're trying to create evm compatible ecosystems that also have the same scalability and Native bridging that you would see if you were a Cosmos app app chain so I like there there is sort of an area there is an opening and there's a window I'm not saying it's closed we definitely you know have investments in the cosmos Eco system not saying that it's over by any way shape or or form but it is something where the competitors are catching up I think that the lat the last thing I just want to get your kind of take on before we move here is just because it was kind of a central idea to the the whole app chain thesis part of this season of bell curve is one uh I think advantage that you have if you're if you're a validator set um understands the semantics of the application and that I think is just a I'm not sure how you bridge that gap for something like ethereum where there's validators for generalized block space and then even in this model there'll be first it's a single sequencer then it's a decentralized sequencer set but it's not going to understand the semantics of the different applications that that run on top of that so it allows you a little bit more flexibility from a product standpoint or what do you think so l3s um I mean l3s roll apps whatever you want to call them like I I kind of can that's kind of what I mean when I say like supernets and subnets these are going to become application specific ecosystems or application specific networks and I I bet you see you know like a SMB game ecosystem and that's just going to be like all the fast casual games you know with the same basic use cases and the same basic um interactions with the L2 or the L1 whatever it may be I'm guessing it's L2 um that supernet that subnet will be specific for that ecosystem you also may see like a single game that has its own subnet or supernet and and so I think you're going to see the bifurcation there but I I think these subnets and supernets just like the Cosmos app chains are going to be application or application ecosystems specific well I guess well honestly like I'm kind of a you know I'm a supporter of both both here rooting for everyone I I mean I do think that the op stack and and oh one thing I um I had a couple conversations about uh bass in general because I want to get a sense of if developers are interested in that because it's kind of like there's a bunch of users that might use it but it's also could be like a corporate chain apparently the developers are super excited about it they're like yeah there's 108 million potential users and they're excited to build stuff on base I think it was such a win for coinbase I'm so happy for them I think they nailed it so I'm very I'm stoked for them would you be as excited if they built a cosmos chain yeah I think I would I would yeah I would be dude I would be don't I go on I I would I think I think it would be very I'm sure they probably thought about that I actually think it's a it's a probably relevant question to ask why they didn't um so you know it's a fair question I mean I think the other thing just to tap into a little bit more of what you were saying I think we're gonna see a shift back to people realizing that they have to have sustainable businesses so they're going to know where the users are they're not going to have this like oh like the users are coming the developers are coming like we're gonna have this tool that serves five people no it's like we need something that serves an immediate population and immediate market now otherwise we're not going to be around in a year or 18 months when we need to do our next fundraise and and so I think it's not really just like a oh our people outside about it it's like oh this is maybe the only way that I can continue forward and I think that that's that's a narrative that we've been talking about kind of here there over the last six nine 12 months but it's definitely becoming more real now I think a lot of the investing arguments in crypto are Supply based which is probably comes from like the Bitcoin 21 million hard cap narrative but I think demand-based uh Arguments for investment are always a little bit more compelling probably speaking of our friends over in in Bitcoin land uh what do you guys think about did you see Yuga Labs announce something um they have their own native uh Bitcoin nfts um there's also there's like Signs of Life what do you guys think we're waiting for you to bring up this General topic you guys have a spicy take no no they're cool I think ordinals are cool I think it's I do too we're doing things other than just being like a culture of being against everything being for something is cool um it's a lot different there's a difference between like being able to kind of crudely transcribe something into a blockchain versus having like the apps the D5 the user base the culture of like trading and making these things cultural so I think that's the next step that it's going to be interesting to see them take and it's cool to see Udi and like Nick be like reinvigorated with purpose versus kind of like just like there's only going to be 21 million of these things I don't I don't know how much people care about the 21 million side of things anymore honestly listen not to uh to toot own horns once again but I I did predict that in 2023 we would start to have a discussion around what the future of Bitcoin looks like and I think that this is in one form a discussion because you're putting something out you're forcing people to make decisions you're forcing miners to make decisions which is going to be the biggest component and to Vance's Point there's nothing really that's changed fundamentally about Bitcoin yet you're sort of just using this in like a end around way to like prove that there's something that could happen but I think it'll Force conversations around maybe this is something that we should natively support like could we natively support this should we natively support this like the the fact that there's going to be conversation around this could make it something that's viable and real right now it's it's truly just a toy uh but eventually it could it could be something real I think I have a very hard time understanding how decisions are made within Bitcoin I don't understand why what the governance structures look like and I understand the stakeholders I know who those I know who those are I know there's the the devs and the miners and the validators but I don't really get how decisions really get pushed forward and who's kind of in control it's really obvious Satoshi comes back every 10 years and he writes all of his Commandments down on you know Sanskrit and and you know we deliver them to the code base it I mean it like ethereum is the EIP process which is like social consensus which is like clients integrating it which is obviously the developer Community being behind it but like just to be transparent like there isn't really like a ABCD EFG process like you try to push it through all core devs calls it usually fails you have to try again you have to Rally people like there is no token governance of ethereum either Bitcoin is more crude than that but it's not entirely entirely different just to be honest yeah I used to when it comes to bitcoin I used to really resist these comparisons to like the Catholic church and some new form of religion but it really does uh fit that that metaphor in a lot of ways or that analogy in a lot of ways I mean there's like the Commandments that you were just joking about Michael they hate the apostates right the people that turned right look just look at all the hate that Nick Carter gets on on Twitter now and they hate him more because he used to be one of them and it is just like religious fervor and there are these people that are like worshiped at the mount it's a little frustrating because I I want a roof I mean I'm more bullish on bitcoin than you guys like I want to root for it and the Bold case for Bitcoin is like would you short the Catholic Church like look at what those guys did they hadn't they had an amazing run like look at them uh so but I wish it was more than that because I feel like it could be more than that but I I don't know listen you may be relatively more bullish on bitcoin than we are but that doesn't mean that we're not bullish on bitcoin or that you know we don't think that there's future potential for it to really change and do something different I I I'm just excited to see that there's at least an opening of the conversation all right guys I think the last thing that I kind of wanted to get your take on was this immutable x uh times Unity SDK announcement so you spend a little bit of time talking about uh kind of like what an app application uh SDK would look like and I think that's still kind of being built can you guys just again just give a little bit of a refresher like what is an SDK I'm like what is it this announcement how is it significant yeah um I mean an SDK is truly just a software development kit so it can mean tons of different things um usually when you're developing something that's consumer facing or like a game for instance uh you're gonna have a bunch of software and a bunch of libraries and a bunch of Integrations into other tools or services or infrastructure and an SDK is just like an interface to be able to do that so if you need to you know interface with AWS like if you need to interface with unity they've done an SDK if you need to it like there's just a common way of communicating and that's what the SDK really represents so what this in particular is uh is immutable and I I it's it's funny you put immutable as like the one that announced this there's actually like 10 more that were a part of this announcement immutable immutable flow Solana Avalanche uh there were a ton of them it's just that I think immutable loves to uh loves to ring the marketing Bill more than more than most um and really what this means is uh they were they were put into What's called the unity App Store and so what what it really means is anybody who wants to build on a mutable you're sort of like a verified vendor within the unity store um which means that you if you're a game that's building on immutable for instance or or flow or any of these other chains you now have a direct plug-in that's like a verified developer with unity um so I think it's a bid move I think frankly like the biggest component of this is just unity's recognition that web3 gaming is something that they want to have plugins for and like feature in their App Store and unity and and just is a backdrop here Unity is one of the two most dominant uh game engines so all the rendering of the graphics all of the like physics all of the motion or like all the different aspects of movement within games all of that is usually controlled by a game engine and and unity is one of the two uh most dominant DM engines that are underpinning you know all games every single one um or you can develop the drafts yourselves but like most most developers most am developers just don't do that these days so I think the bid takeaway here isn't immutable I think immutable is just louder than everybody else um but what it is is that Unity is recognizing that web3 gaming is definitely something that they want to be a part of um and they want to have interface into the developers directly and so they're going where the developers are which is all these different chains um so very interesting to see but I'd say ultimately very positive what what is your I know we've talked about this before but in terms of I know you guys see a whole bunch of different gaming projects can you like I don't know when I when I think of like the games that I love it's kind of like the like the Halo 3 was kind of like my game like the Call of Duties or stuff like that that's not really what we're talking about here with crypto gaming like what are the what are the models that kind of like excite you guys or like what are the some of the stuff that some kind of like The Cutting Edge of gaming in crypto like how do you think it looks different from uh traditional gaming the thesis is very simple um once Gamers realize that they can actually get something out of playing these games and spending massive amounts of money on them they will never go back to the old model and right now we don't have a lot of proof points on our side we have small scale examples of success things like pixels um you know obviously like axi Infinity was not a good proof point that was just like the the euthanasia roller coaster for largely Southeast Asian people it didn't work out that well but there is something powerful with being able to play something being able to have ownership of your game assets and being able to create value at the end of the day not just having the game extract value from you but building something that has value on chain with the rest of the community and realizing some sort of collective success and that's a thesis um and you know it's taking longer than we would have thought but by the second half of this year I think we're going to see a few games starting to improve this model out and you know we're not looking for a hundred games to work we're looking for one it only takes one and once you have that success case everyone is going to copy paste iterate towards it and that's really kind of what grows the top of funnel of crypto at the end of the day it is the only consumer use case that has enough scale to put a billion people on chain and it's the clearest it's the clearest thesis that we have for that to happen I would describe it as the bottom of the first inning where everybody has started to like build these things they've started to test them they've started to iterate with them um frankly like they have pretty wide Distribution on the beta uh betas for these games and what what happens is you you build a game right and you get the graphics right you get the storyline right you like have this entire world that you've developed and then you put a bunch of people into the ecosystem and you're like all right now go run free and let's see what happens and that's really when game development starts because that's when you start to balance out the game you start to figure out what the economy needs to look like you start to figure out like how many of these different attributes resources capabilities should I put into the game at the start how how should I be doing like my live Ops which is essentially like the re-ups every week every two weeks of like how many of these things am I going to be Distributing like I need to be constantly managing this economy you know like some of the most simple games are some of the most successful games just because they have the best live Ops operations on the back end and every two weeks there's new content and it just keeps people refreshed it keeps people going if you beat the game people stop playing the game and so you have to keep it refreshed so like we're in that rebalancing phase right now so a lot of exciting data like anecdotally you know there's we've we've invested in a number of um former game Executives game developers in pre-web three gaming and some of the retention cohorts that they're seeing is like three four five times what they would expect to see uh just because you have imbued value into something that people own and that fact alone and if you can communicate that effectively to The Gamers they stick around because they own part of the game and so I I think that's like step one that's like web 2.5 for for gaming what I think web3 and this is a hypothesis at this point what I think web3 for gaming actually turns into is is a lot more user generated content and so it's not just like you get to own something it's you get to create something in the game and that just imbues further ownership but it also imbues like your own creativity like you get to put your own your own swag into it you get to do whatever you want within the confines of the game and like that's the real value of game I like Vance and I built a game prior to framework called hash lights and that was an experiment in and of itself but like back then in 2017 2018 everyone's like oh blockchain's gonna enable games to be interoperable and like I remember getting a question uh when we were going through the process they were like well what if you put like you know a monster on top of Tom Brady's body and like you run around and it's like no no no like that would ruin the game and you would lose your license immediately so like that makes no sense but like that's what people were talking about like this whole interop layer and and sure maybe like if you're a game publisher and you have three related games and the characters are all the same and you want to have interop between those specific games like totally that makes total sense but like the value of blockchain gaming isn't going to be anything that's interop it's going to be ownership and and creation so that I think that's kind of like the thesis that we're refining our our previous thesis into yeah there was a guy who he spoke his name is Josh Rosenthal and he sort of gives this talk about this he he spoke it permissionless but he's also been on uh bankless you know a number of times and he kind of has this analogy of like imagine you are living in like the Dark Ages you know you're a peasant in kind of medieval times imagine just trying to explain to that person how little ownership and how little Freedom they have it's like what do you mean like I wake up like I go when I you know get my hay and I get my food or whatever uh but there'd be no way of saying like dude you don't own any of that land you know you can't hire people there's you it's just very difficult to reframe that reference and I think that's what that I kind of see that in the gaming side of things as well it's like hey we're trying to actually give you stuff here we're trying to give you back some of this value that has traditionally just accrued to game makers or or social media in general but I think it's a compelling thesis but I can see how it takes a little while to get there mentally the Theses that we've had that have worked have always been very simple like we're gonna allow you to own a part of the game we are going to build Financial Services on chain like the stuff that's like for their field where it's like we're going to do social network and like you're gonna own your own post maybe you can sell it to somebody else it's like those things have like generally never worked it's going to take longer but like I don't know it feels like it's starting to work at a very small scale and it gives us hope that this is going to really whips on in the right direction when it really works well and and just another analogy I mean think about how much value there is in physical real estate obviously and you know the the different slices of ownership the different ways that you can manage it the different you know things that you build on top of it or do with it but think about how increasingly each successive generation is living their lives in a digital realm and this may be I mean it may be social media but it may be you know in these game ecosystems it may be in like I mean in game ecosystems would be like three-dimensional it could be like yeah it could be two-dimensional and pixelated it doesn't really matter but like you're still spending hours of your life in that ecosystem and instead of you know you being the peasant that's sitting outside the gates you know owning your own hay you actually now get to be an owner in that instance of that game in that digital realm and there's value in that for you younger Generations that's the only value that they know I also the the Simplicity Point kind of resonates honestly man sometimes if you like listen to business podcasts you would think the way that things happen is you're sitting in a room and you come up with some brilliant strategy and you just do it it is just so not how it happens in practice usually it's there was if there is something cool that you do it's the result of someone someone told us this um they're like hey it's really cool how you guys built a media company backwards because you started with the thing that makes money and then you reverse engineered the media and I was like yeah we totally thought of that when really it took us three years to realize that what we were building was a media company and we were just trying to make it work and it sounds all cool to talk on pot but I I generally think most strategy actually comes from just executing and tactics and you know needing to do something necessity is the mother of invention but totally backwards from how I thought it was going to work the same thing with pitches too like if you hear a good pitch you leave the call and you're like all right let's invest if you need to do like diligence oh like we do if you need to do like research and like studying Trends and like you know what's the growth rate of this country what's the size of that market like it usually is is not a good investment like the best things are usually very simple What's the phrase it's a 10 strategy 100 execution yeah right I've I'm with you on that I assure you it wasn't brains that got me here hiring is kind of the same it's totally I don't know you know yeah I have to usually on a hiring call in like a last stage or something like Jason and I kind of get looped in at the end and we'll be on and after like two minutes I have to stop myself from being like this is a yes for me or this is a no for me like you just get that very very quickly I I think you know what what we're all kind of saying is it comes down to Clarity and like can you communicate Clarity efficiently and if it's very clear it's very simple it's very obvious yeah and like 100 let's bring it back to gaming biggest Market by far people who look and feel like crypto natives check games that are coming to Market in the second half of the year and like people are already fading blockchain games with no blockchain games out there well there's one it's called axi and it's still kicking here's a contrarian prediction I think axi comes back you think actually comes let me let me let me let me let me not to their not to their not to their old you know way of doing things but let me break it down for you very simple they have a large studio they have a lot of money they've experienced building games a Rebrand might be necessary yeah new new coat of paint whatever you want to call a different name but like it's pretty simple in my mind like we don't have any axi we're not we don't have any exposure but like best things are very simple I've got a I've got a way Dumber like just stupid pattern matching observation that kind of aligns with that is I feel like in crypto there's this history of something like makes a big splash like way earlier than it should in a cycle and then it comes back like full force next cycle like I'll give you an example it's like uh crypto kitties was like an nft project that caused like a ton of hype and then there was nothing after that and everyone was like oh yeah nfts were like kind of a thing but like look at crypto kitties and now look at nfts even with like the Dow right there was like the Dow and it worked and it was like a phenomenal failure and then it just kind of laid there dormant and actually has the potential to that just feels like that to me you know obviously there was something there and now there's not much but using that same analogy if actually is crypto kitties I'm not saying that crypto kitties is back in any way but maybe web3 gaming will come back because it's nfts it's back now I mean you can think of the analogy in similar ways I guess you could also say crypto kitties is Dapper Dapper has a lot of other things that they've built um but you know I I actually think the biggest thing is um anything in crypto that hasn't truly died like truly died as long as you're alive and you can make it across Market Cycles there is a chance that you come back bigger and and larger than you were before I agree with that I think dydx actually did that pretty well they initially launched there was a long period where it was just I kind of knew what they were but uh and then suddenly they were back one day so I mean all of the original Primitives of D5 summer uh D5 D5 summer time uh all of those are are still the top D5 protocols oh by the way I do want to give a shout out to uh we we use their phrase at the top of this episode but bankless I just got reported that they're racing a 35 million dollar VC fund love those guys uh Ryan and David are we we have a kind of an informal no Partnerships policy at block Works we've just over the years but they're the one partnership where they like really do what they say they're gonna do they're phenomenal to work with and I think the world of them so hope it works out for them that's that's great hats off to them they're the best all right fellas I think that's all the time we have but this is a fun one Jason I miss you buddy I feel bad about that joke miss you dude if you're doing well Denver peace [Music]
