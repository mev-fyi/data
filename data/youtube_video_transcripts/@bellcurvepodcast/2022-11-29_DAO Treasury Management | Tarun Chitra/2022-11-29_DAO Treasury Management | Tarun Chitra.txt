before we jump into the app quick reminder that nothing on bell curve is financial advice everything is just a meme hope you guys enjoy like the point of a token to some extent and this is not legal or financial advice but it's it's to some extent like allow you to not have to distribute any share of earnings but always have some sort of ability to say you have a claim to it indirectly but I think I think the idea of like businesses that actually don't want to have a token so like the two ones that I think of most prominently for this are like flashbots or eigenlayer you do actually need to distribute cash because you don't have any way for people to speculate on the future cash flow of your thing huge shout out to our sponsor Reserve if you don't know Reserve we're going to talk more about them later in the show but Reserve is the easiest way to design deploy and govern stable coins backed by a diverse set of assets with access to defy yield and insurance super interesting very excited to partner with Reserve you'll hear more about them later in the show should we get into it let's get into it do it all right see you on the other side all right we have a new episode of bell curve today we are recording with tarun uh hopefully you're not watching on video because Mike is not looking his best today so I would recommend this one on Apple Apple or Spotify would be a preferable for this one so Mike what are we talking to a tarun about here correct I do have a face for radio uh so we're talking to tarun all about Dow treasury management so the reason why this is coming up is you know one of the key uh you know talking points when it comes to Dow governance is how these dials should manage and allocate their treasury so tarun is going to lay out uh basically a couple of Frameworks for how he thinks about treasury management like what kind of phase one two three we even get to four 4.0 of what Dow treasury management should look like he's also got a new product era a refinance which basically helps Dows manage their their treasury so we get into all about the definitions of what it means and we ask them some of the tough questions about how dow should be managing their treasuries it's a great episode yeah really good episode for those who don't know tarun he runs Gauntlet and Gauntlet is basically a risk manager for protocols so really really Hands-On with a bunch of different protocols and has seen a lot of the treasury management issues that have cropped up over the last like 12 months it's also got the best style on crypto best style I think he's wearing a kimono for this episode I was like great shirt he's like it's not a shirt it's a kimono so I mean who does that who does that I don't know man guy's a better style than me I'll tell you that um that's not saying much but that's okay no it's not it's true low bar basically lay the bar on the floor for tuning to hop over there but he doesn't but he does it with Grace so um all right let's let's get into it let's get into this yeah let's get into the episode all right everyone welcome back to another episode of bell curve Today Jason and I are joined by tarun chitra tarun welcome to the show hey excited to be here yeah thanks very much uh all right so we're gonna be talking about a pretty Hot Topic in crypto which is Dao treasury management uh I think there are a lot of misconceptions about how treasuries are supposed to work in sort of is that really a Hot Topic right now is that is that the hottest topic of uh in my mind it is in my mind it is all right yeah but we could say the hottest on-chain topic yeah yeah all right for the on-chain Maximus out there we're all thinking about this uh I think there were a lot of uh misconceptions about what this might mean uh so true maybe uh you actually just give the audience sort of an overview of when we talk about treasury management maybe as it traditionally looks like in a more corporate environment what does that function kind of mean and then we can transition into what do treasuries look like in in dowland yeah for sure so I mean I think just generically right when you think about the function that say like a CFO or head of accounting or anyone who didn't work at FTX kind of did uh getting given there given that it seems like there was no one doing this there um a lot of what they do is they take in the cash flows that are coming in and the accounts payable going out and they have to figure out how to manage that money so maybe sometimes it's like if I'm treasury management for say like a someone manufacturing physical Goods involves basically figuring out how to uh you know you might be getting one really big payment like when I deliver the chips or I deliver a house or whatever um but I need to somehow manage my cash flows before that and that might mean you know be basically borrowing um or it might mean like holding excess cash in bonds because I need the yield um it might also mean that I need to think about you know liabilities I have like holding out money for interest payments and things like that that I have so that's like sort of the most Bare Bones thing that every business that is a business that ever has you know cash coming in money going out has to think about that's like the the basics of 101 treasury management now software is sort of different um and in a lot of ways that's sort of the reason I think for instance private Equity firms didn't invest in software until like the 2010s is because they didn't understand how to think about how to manage those treasuries couldn't figure out how to do that and software is interesting in that you get these kind of like subscription-like payments where you might get like a you know a bunch of them and and it's sort of growing and if you're thinking about how to manage the treasury you have to think about a should I be diversifying B should I be investing in new products C should I be uh you know buying back stock or issuing dividends and so there's sort of this interesting trade-off of how much you invest in future growth versus how much do you invest in sort of financial management of your portfolio versus how much do you sort of give back to existing investors and so that's you know I would say treasury management 201 is that you have those three functions you have to think about how to manage those um it can be hard and I think in the 2015 to 819 range there are tons of companies uh there are fintech companies that were trying to basically do treasury management for startups because usually you had to be a big enough company for it to be worth hiring someone paying the financing costs having the banking relationships things like that so you know companies like modern treasury were sort of like fintech companies built around giving startups access to the same type of tools [Music] um and then I think the final thing the hardest type of Treasury management is uh is when you're in exchange or a financial asset uh purveyor like a bank because you have to think about money that's coming in that's technically income to you money that's other people's money that you're holding and managing and you can't treat that as your Treasury and then liabilities of things you're lending out and you know basically giving people some types of loans on and that that's sort of the hardest type of management I would say that D5 protocols kind of fall in the last camp other parts other types of dowels are probably closer to the middle camps or a little bit like tech companies but broadly speaking you you have this pool of capital you have these cash flows coming in cash flows going out and you need to figure out how to allocate to Future growth sustainable management and then also like servicing debt servicing liabilities those are like the top three things so I know I went through like a hierarchy of things but hopefully that gives us some grounding to talk about it yeah no I think that's that's great so maybe if I could just like summarize what you talked about there treasury management 1.0 at its most basic form is just manager cash flows make sure you have enough on the finance the financing part of the business should basically support the operational part of business you don't want to run out of money then maybe 2.0 which is more applicable to software this is a little bit more of a capital allocation question that goes into it right which is how do you balance kind of investing in future growth which or maybe like returning cash shareholders or or looking at what are the different opportunities you have for managing or allocating your cash and then there's even like a third complication when it comes to fintech or D5 and banking which is like you sometimes have assets on your balance sheet which technically aren't yours right so maybe the most obvious case just because you reference FTX before is sort of customer deposits but maybe if that's Ave or compound right those are your your pools right uh and those aren't really owned by the platform but you're sort of responsible for them um is that maybe kind of an accurate summary yeah yeah so maybe let's talk a little bit about um you know how how do you think about kind of uh that solving that 2.0 uh part of things and you know how how are Dows right now kind of trading off um you know they've got this this big pool of assets often it's in their their sort of native token and what are those kind of conversations look like are they sophisticated conversations for the most part about managing cash flows and investing in the future growth versus not or like what is what are what are some of the internal discussions about treasury management from your perspective sort of look like yeah I mean I think the case studies uh in a lot of ways are the things that failed um and then looking at sort of how what would have happened counterfactually had they actually been able to sell part of their Treasury the sushi swap uh case where they tried to sell sushi for dollars Sushi was at like six or seven dollars um you know I think I think it might actually be more but last time I did this calculation it was like they would have it had the vote passed the Dow would have had 60 million dollars which is much more than it has now to spend on on sort of operations and most of the reason for that was that people who were um you know how how does a dow spend money well people who own the Dow tokens have to vote on having the Dow one of the larger owners of those tokens sell its tokens for ether usdc or some other asset and there's obviously very bad incentive if you're trying to say hey use this token to vote on selling the asset you own so like I'm voting with this asset I'm voting on making its price go down right that's that's already always going to be a little bit of a incentive misalignment in a lot of ways um so uh I I think because of that you you really need to think through like how how Dows are supposed to incentivize things right now I think the majority of Dow spending that is not on you know people who are direct service providers like Auditors or people like my company Gauntlet or or others like in that world is via grants and the grants are you know they're you know they're sort of like a community pool and then people in the community the community votes on sort of a grants committee and then the grants committee distributes money that's the only way these Dows are funding growth um I think uniswap in particular some of them have funded charitable uh donations I think especially around the Ukraine Invasion time um and also in unified case they donated to this lobbying group called The defy education fund but more or less I think the conversations around how to spend this money are pretty unsophisticated uh although everyone now realizes they should have been having those conversations nine months ago so I think the inter I think the reason this is such a Hot Topic is everyone has you know buyers or lack of buyers or they have remorse for not being a buyer or seller strikes me about the two big issues today are um uh one one is just that the community manages that there's a community that there's a community of a protocol they own the tokens so like let's use Ave for example Ave has a bunch of Ave tokens um I'm I don't know the exact scenario but I'm just gonna make this up and use obviously example here sorry Stony but Ave has a bunch of Ave tokens uh and there's a pub they need to the proper treasury management solution would be to hold your treasury in something like usdc in like a stable US dollar coin something like that um but then you have a bunch of people who don't want the price of Ave to go down so they don't so if Ave comes out and says hey we're going to sell a bunch of Ave uh the community basically freaks out because they they want to keep they want to see the price of Ave uh they want to see the price of Ave go up not down right so that's the first big problem uh and then the second the second problem is that you are basically trying to optimize for decentralization and you're doing Capital Management around Capital Management is really like a one or two or three person game like there are a lot of a lot of hedge funds a lot of VC firms are managed a lot of capital allocation even CFOs like those are usually pretty small teams they're like two or three or four person teams but we're trying to basically keep decentralization the D and the Dow but that doesn't really work for Capital allocation it so those it seems like those are the two biggest problems would you agree with that term I think the third problem I'd add to that is that Dows don't have good kpis for what their treasury management strategy should be it's not like they are like okay our treasury management strategies like we want to invest in growth at all costs if they did that then that would be great even if that might not work out and the Dow dies at least having a clear goal like that makes a lot of sense or like hey we want to be conservative and like earn yield but in a very conservative manner or hey we want like to be risky and one thing to remember if you think about it is Dows are supposed to be online native institutions institutions like a BlackRock and in a lot of ways right they have a bunch of capital whether it's sort of capital as Equity or Capital as as dollars and they need to deploy it but anytime they deploy it they actually like cause other people to go trade against them or chase it so there's always some adverse selection but their goals are not necessarily to just maximize return because in a lot of ways that's actually quite hard for them to do in a decentralized way right so I think the idea that Dows are institutions and in the normal World institutions have very complicated and not obvious goals in a lot of ways is extremely important to to keep in mind right it's like why do Pension funds invest in Venture right it's in theory that's because part of their goal is diversification also part of their goal is um to fund things that other people won't fund because you get locked up for five to ten years uh and there's some premium for that uh and there's just a lot of different and you're a pension fund so your time Horizon is like 30 years and so I think there's a lot of stuff like that that Dows have you know I I think like their thoughtfulness and care and deciding on that first will help you figure out how to do steps one and two and and right now Dow's goals with their treasuries are very unclear for the most part do you think that uh you know we had Derek and Larry from reverie uh on on one of our earlier episodes and you know they wrote this great piece of musings on governance and they had a couple Choice words and we actually talked about very briefly at the end of our episode with them about recommendations on Treasury management and they had very pointed recommendation for davs which is that treasuries are not hedge funds or endowments they're not supposed to be run in the same way with the same objectives I mean how much you know and sometimes you see these discussions on forums and you do get the sense that you're trying to maximize a financial return because you have this pool of of capital so you know again just maybe being a little bit prescriptive for some of these Styles like if someone's sitting there and maybe either you're a contributor to a dow or you have some say in terms of how treasury gets managed maybe to the grant program maybe in some other way I mean how would you talk to that person about how you should be thinking about even if you don't get Rock Solid kpis tomorrow how should you change your thinking a little bit from managing at pool of capital like a hedge fund to how treasury is supposed to function I'm not sure about the endowments uh comparison because like endowments are first of all not one size fits all right like moma's Endowment invests in things not for financial return often right because it has an Institutional goal of supporting art via its endowment on top of you know the goal of the institution so I think like throwing endowments under the bus maybe is like okay fine Ivy League school endowments are one thing but there are other endowments in the world that are still hundreds of millions or billions of dollars that have social missions or like fund a non-profit or things like that right which which are closer hopefully in spirit to Dao and in in that scenario those institutions do have sort of some cultural goals of like the ethos of the institution that needs to show show through and what they are actually doing which I think these grants committees are trying to do I'd say that's like the de minimis thing they're trying to do is basically figure out what the cultural values of this community are and you know distribute based on that of course the problem is most of those cultural values uh still have some Financial portion in this industry there's no there's sort of no getting around that um but I think for D5 protocols in particular their treasuries should really be thought of as bank balance sheets and that means that you need to be careful about Insurance costs are like how much you can cover liabilities of users in your protocol and also the trade-off between like how much of your treasury you're willing to make a capital buffer so that you can offer more competitive products like higher interest higher amounts of margin or higher amounts of risk um and those trade-offs are extremely Financial I I would say like in in those cases you actually do need to think of it a bit more like a bank I wouldn't say it's a hedge fund or an endowment but you really need to think about management the way a bank thinks about assets and liabilities on its balance sheet and in particular you need to think about it in a way that you know doesn't get you to insolvency arguably the mango markets hack shares some some some sort of abstract similarities with with uh you know the insolvency at FTX in the sense that they had a token that was worthless backing most of its Insurance Fund and so the Insurance Fund was very easy to make insolvent via price manipulation on top of being able to borrowed against so it it sort of like actively managing your treasury to ensure that if there is leverage against your equity in the same way that you could try to have leverage against Bank equity and go short on it around a capital crisis um it's extremely important to maintaining the safety of your protocol even if you are you know the number one benefit of Defy is in traditional Finance Banks you know corporate debt structure is such that you know if they went bankrupt the customers are not guaranteed to be first in line like debtors might be first preferred shareholders might be first Etc uh on the other hand in defy the core tenant is that the customer is always the first one allowed to exit right you can always withdraw from the protocol however whenever you use your own governance token as a a lending asset or you know in the case of mango like they just didn't optimize their parameters like when Mango's price goes down 90 you shouldn't allow people to get the same leverage on Mango as you do Soul it's like it is very similar to ftt in that way and I think I think this is one of those things where you do actually have to think about a D5 protocol's treasury as an insurance fund and insurance funds need management there's no there's just kind of no way around that uh but I do agree for doubts that are not purely financial instruments like you know maybe like a game Dow or nft Dao they definitely have more of this quality of like what's the cultural values that we want to imbue in our treasury in our spending of our Treasury and how do we kind of do that safely do you like see let's use the example of something like Ave or compound or like this would be like what a bank looks like as well right there's a there's a balance sheet there whether you have assets and liabilities even for something like coinbase you'd have customer deposits show up as an asset but that's not something you can necessarily use do you think that's a you know in what sense is that a liability of the protocol and how should that inform your uh your treasury management right like let's say let's just use the example of a hack or something on on Ave you could it hasn't really happened yet but you could make the case that Ave shouldn't necessarily be responsible it's a it's a software I would probably make the argument that Ave should compensate users if a pool is compromised basically but how do you think about you know how do you kind of think about those assets that are not technically owned by the protocol or Dao and how does that kind of build into or factor into the treasury management strategy that you select this has happened on compound actually I guess we can start with compound first um so I think in December 2020 um there was this thing where the chain link Oracle uh sorry the the compound Oracle because they were they had a separate Oracle at that time was manipulated and a bunch of loans got defaulted because die was marked at a dollar 30 cents but it was actually basically a dollar and um you know basically what happened was was like there the people went through governance and then the protocol eventually compensated people for for those losses in Ave there's an explicit version of this which is the obvious safety module now in the bull market prices were high enough to support actually being real coverage right but the problem is without active treasury management the liabilities of the protocol can change arbitrarily right like anyone can come and take a loan and create a liability for the protocol but the assets aren't being rebalanced and that's sort of the the key is that like without some notion of active management you may actually have assets that suddenly decrease when your liabilities increase which is the worst thing to have happen because if your asset values are plummeting right when your liabilities are growing you basically can't cover what's what's there and this type of shortfall event whether it's FTX whether it's mango whether it's other protocols can happen if you're not managing a the sort of amount of Leverage in you know the risk parameter of the system but also B if you're not managing the treasury very carefully and in the case of avian compound they between having you know a risk manager who who's conservative but also uh basically not really offering crazy leverage in in other ways um and not allowing you to re-hypothecate their token too much like borrow against their token they were they were able to effect effectively Escape uh pretty much unscathed um and I guess my point is these treasuries are part of that story right if you do want to get to the point where on-chain protocols for perpetuals or lending can achieve the same Capital efficiency as an off-chain protocol like a centralized one you have to have some way of having a capital buffer that is able to make sure that assets are always greater than liabilities and and and that boils down to treasury management so this might seem like a nuanced thing but I I do think that it will you know if if we want to get to the world where there's more volume and perps on chain or in a layer two like do idx which I'd call sort of in the middle of pure defy and not uh uh you really need to actually get good at treasury management like that that that's the key and and the key the other important thing and this might be the ultimate time to emphasize this goal is that transparent the transparency of G5 means that you can have infinite comfort in both proofs of liabilities like how much the protocol is actually giving out leverage and proof of assets and one of the things that's a little bit of a LARP right now is the a lot of the proof of Reserve stuff it's basically asking someone to be a third party auditor to say like okay these are my wallets I've signed transactions from them here's proof that I control the private key uh and then them just saying like at a testing that's your address but that doesn't mean they've shown you anything about their liabilities in fact their off-chain liabilities who knows they're which you know the FTX cases the it's not like even if they did prove reserves you've never seen that loan honestly yeah you need proof of reserves plus proof of liability approval liability is really hard I think one interesting thing is a lot of times when you talk to exchanges about personal liabilities they don't uh include a lot of liabilities that they have on their balance sheet that they don't can they don't think about for instance um binance for instance helps you like put customer funds into BSC protocols so like putting money in into Venus or pancakes off if there was a hack kind of like the the bridge hack those assets are technically went from from ask customer assets to liabilities because binance has to get them back right the proof of liability is that most people call proof of liabilities does not include things like that especially around hacks and in D5 that's the opposite like you do really know the full loan book at all times you know like you know avian compound's exposure is always and I think that should be the gold standard right obviously we have a long way to go to get the efficiency of that to be equivalent but the reason it's the gold standard is the proofs of liabilities and assets are built into the protocols and like zero knowledge proofs plus D5 will be you know in you know obviously the mechanism design is not complete in that world yet but the moment that actually works you can get you should be able to get close to C5 um with active treasury management active risk management and you know an ability to preserve some privacy because I think privacy is still extremely important right one thing I can't help but thinking thinking about so earlier at the beginning of the show you mentioned like treasury management 101 it's like making sure you have enough cash to like service the business 201 is like starting to get into like dividends and share BuyBacks maybe some M A things like that 301 is you know basically when when you're like a bank and you have to separate like customer deposits versus your own balance sheet things like that there's also I'd say like maybe like 401 which is what we talked about over lunch last week uh of you know if you're United for example and you have to uh hedge out the the risk that oil might go up or something like that or you uh it's kind of like Fortune well what Fortune 500s do with their balance sheet right which is hedging out commodity risks usually it does sound like when I think about all of the startups that we know really what they do is treasure management 101. let me make sure that I have enough cash in the bank to service my business but now what you're telling me is you have all these startups that are 10 20 30 person startups that need to become really Adept at doing treasure management 401 am I and and 301 yeah and 301 crypto projects it makes you actually skip you don't actually even need 201 because you don't really care about M A or dividend go straight to 301 and yeah yeah basically so yeah the 401 piece is actually the most important part in the normal financial markets and this might be the point where I sort of probably disagree with with um Larry and Derek a little bit is that institutions have a role in making markets more functional and liquid not necessarily in the same way that a hedge fund does so you know for instance let's say I'm an institution I for some reason ended up buying a bunch of Airline stocks um and you know Airline stocks are just anti-correlated to gas prices so I start buying gas Futures with the idea that like hey I'm hedging some of that exposure if like gas costs go up my Airline stocks go down but at least I got I still own some some exposure to gas and oil the thing is most institutions that do that type of stuff don't care a lot about their exact execution price right they're fine paying two percent which if you talk to like a Trader like especially a Quant Trader or you know like a desk Trader they would just be like Ah that's too expensive and that's because they're thinking about the purely speculative reasons to buy derivatives right they're not thinking about I'm actually hedging some commodity I own or I is somehow like related to the assets I own they're they're just like how can I flip this quickly right and you're not going to make a profit at two percent right the same thing with the nft royalties thing right like there's a reason that those fees go down [Music] um and so but institutions are fine with that because they want to have long-term exposure and they have a bunch of assets on their balance sheet that they have to head they have no choice right and so D5 protocols Dows are very similar they have a bunch of assets on their balance sheet that they want to hedge their own governance token but they also don't want to give up a lot of rights to those right because they ostensibly want to still make sure the Dow has a lot of ownership in the protocol itself um and so dowels actually function a lot like you know these institutions that are the long-term buyers of derivative products whether it's Futures options swaps Etc and you know I think an interesting case study of of how there hasn't there this Market sort of still isn't mature enough yet on chain is that we you know we have this huge burst of interest in these Dov vaults which are like the options of all it's like ribbon Finance really great in uh in a bull market right because because you basically are capturing some type of certain option strategies that do well when there's at least some sort of sideways Behavior or slightly positive behavior not so great in a bear market and we if you saw like these vaults when the prices went down everyone pulled all their money and when they pulled money they caused this like bad liquidity crisis people removed money from Dov vaults the protocols Panic removed liquidity or something Panic removed they're just defined to like hey if you're redeeming we just remove liquidity instantly and then that caused the option prices to get more expensive people stopped buying options and you have this bad feedback loop on the other hand in normal Finance you have this positive feedback loop where institutions who are long some assets buy the hedging products even when the market is down right they keep they keep hedging their exposure to oil even when the Market's down because they're they they're not trying to just sell their assets and speculate on their Treasury and in that sense D5 protocols and owls but D5 protocol daos in particular um need to get good at treasury management 401 which you know I I think is is the next stage of of the on-chain evolution in finance do you think there's any way this can be done in a decentralized way like in in the forums basically yeah so you know obviously I'm going to to at this point talk my book about this because I've spent the last year thinking about how to build protocols for for this problem after having watched and participated in many unsuccessful diversification discussions before you before before you uh plug era which you should definitely do can you say can you just explain how it's currently done right now oh the way it's currently done is someone makes a forum post says like hey we should do x with the treasury people discuss for two weeks then they do a snapshot vote and then maybe they'll vote for it um oftentimes if the sentiment isn't very good in the forums it'll never even get the snapshot often it gets a snapshot a lot of people don't vote in the snapshot that doesn't pass and then also if the snapshotty passes oftentimes once it's on chain the bigger holders are like oh no I don't want the Dow to sell and they vote they realize at the last minute so yeah there's lots of it and I would add the second way that it's being done is now there are a lot of funds who are coming in and asset managers who are coming in saying hey you a bunch of 22 year olds don't know how to manage your treasury let us the hedge fund the professional hedge fund with some gray hairs manage your treasury for you which is also a bad option because now you're just giving the your treasury to a fund and um if we haven't learned anything from makerdale's proposal where they lent to Gemini earn and then now have exposure to Genesis which I'm sure maker the maker people who were very anti the strategy are extremely like angry about um you know yeah being extremely careful about keeping your assets on chain as a dow I think is really really important um I think the moment you move any Dow assets off chain you basically are not actually growing the ecosystem around your protocol or users and we've seen that happen before so like I think after 2017 and 2018 a lot of the layer one foundations they you know raise these icos they had these treasuries and they would sort of delegate their treasuries to trading firms um either via token loans or other types of structures and the trading firms just took them and traded on binance and FTX and stuff like that they didn't use much of the on-chain mechanics in that in those layer ones and so then they didn't really grow the on-chain network of the layer ones like there's tons of layer ones who like they probably should have been spending their treasury on being liquidity providers and protocols on their network not doing token loans to trading firms who are trading on Finance or FTX right they're not generating real transaction volume for your network then right whereas in defy I think like the network effect of D5 comes in when like protocol a uses protocol B maybe it's treasury diversifies puts part in profile B protocol B uses protocol a uh with part of its Treasury and the net actual productive output is that by both of them providing liquidity on each other's protocols they actually lower their transaction costs for both of their protocols so more people use those protocols right and there's a synergistic effect of like protocols using each other and that that Network effect is the beauty I think of a lot of the early East defy I think like the com that was when people really understood what composability meant and why it was important was really understanding how you could Loop these things together I think treasuries also need to do the same thing not just Traders using these protocols all right everyone brief break in the show here to talk about our newest sponsor Reserve so you know it's looking pretty bleak out there it's not looking that great but you know what the one thing there's no bear Market in stable coins Stables babies Stables we love those stable Coins app which is why we're excited to partner with Reserve protocol so let's just start with the basics what is reserve it's a self-service platform to build deploy and govern asset-backed stable coins uh which can be integrated with D5 or within the real economy so the cool thing about Reserve is basically anyone out there permissionlessly can take any set of erc20 tokens and use them to collateralize their own stable coin so the long-term goal of the reserve protocol is to create a non-inflationary currency that is stable on a month-to-month basis but also a century to Century basis in the meantime though they're open sourcing design decisions for stable coins which is just super super cool I think one of the benefits that you get there is diversification you hear it all the time in finance 101 no such thing as a free lunch except for diversification that's is what you're getting with Reserve protocol yeah I've known the team for a long time I spoke on a panel at SF blockchain week with Nevin with Joe Carlson and Alex gladstein really impressive uh growth that they've been able to have so far right the premier stable coin is RSV it is backed by three other Stables it's already used by over half a million people transacting over 300 million dollars a month right now like Mike was talking about anyone can go create a custom bespoke stable coin using the reserve protocol you can back it by maybe specific USD Staples or you can get uh creative and you know maybe build something more complex like inversely correlated assets The Branding governance and composition are completely up to you and lastly if there are any Builders who are listening and you aren't interested in issuing your own stablecoin what you can do is you can stake reserves governance token against your favorite stable strategies so what you're doing there is you're providing backstop Insurance to stablecoin holders not riskless right not Financial advice there's definitely some risk in doing that but it does allow you to earn yield especially now in crypto when there are so few ways to do that it's definitely worth checking out so at the very least you should click the link at the bottom of this episode go check out the reserve website see all the cool stuff they're up to most importantly though click this link gotta give Jason me some credit here give us some love baby give us some love all right now back to the show let's get into it there was a there was a proposal a little while ago just use an example of to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying even between like GMX and rage trade uh I remember where there was some sort of token swapped I mean one of the other benefits of that as well is you know Dow's kind of missed the boat a little bit on diversifying out of their native token right the big problem that also we haven't talked about is most of these Dows are sitting in their own native token and there's no liquidity on their native token right so they've got these liabilities denominated in usdc which you need to pay the people that are contributing to your Dow and you've got you don't have the ability anymore to to transfer your native token into into usdc but one of the things that you can do within a liquid token is swap for another eLiquid token if you get some service in exchange for it so that's kind of what you're describing right there too it's a I'm not actually sure how often that occurs in traditional Corporate Finance I haven't really heard of it people do it but in a weird way which is they make a joint venture that they own right like they do it Equity swaps are more expensive into the traditional World which is exactly one of the benefits of default in some ways interesting it's the fact that you can do these things relatively cheaply with no lawyers right um and like no excess legal costs to to to to do some type of thing like this so maybe this would be a good time to Pivot into I mean you've built a solution here right having been sort of boots on the ground and in your own words participated in some unsuccessful diversification efforts so maybe this would be a good time to talk about what is era um and what parts of the we've outlined so many phases one two three and four where does ERA kind of fit uh in that framework so one a different way of looking at um 401 is uh the allocation it is is how do you solve the allocation problem in the decentralized manner the allocation problem means I have portfolio X like 50 governance tokens 25 each 25 usdc and I have some notion of a kpi or objective of I want to diversify I want to have more yield I want to supply to protocols that are generating fees um I want to make my assets always greater than my liabilities and the question is how do you get people to optimize that metric or you know change your portfolio so that it keeps improving that metric even as market conditions change and in that sense um there's a bit of similarity between sort of the approach I've been thinking of and we've been building out and sort of something like numeri which is if you if you've heard of it haven't heard it as like sort of this thing where people give like the crowdsourced um trading models and then memorize the corporation sort of Aggregates their trading models and then trades on them and then based on how well they do they get some profit the difference between something like numeri and and this is that a um this is meant to be fully transparent like you can see the the Dow token holders vote on an objective they vote on we want 20 percent of our treasury to always be spent on making sure assets are greater than liabilities and they can see the measurement and calculation of that and they can see the execution of that so all of the trades that are done all of the portfolio changes are done on chain the and the idea is people submit their portfolios on chain to get aggregated they build an on-chain track record and then based on how good they are how how their recommendations over time work they get fees paid for by the Dow and so the idea is is sort of you know making it so that this thing that you see in every treasury diversification which is if you go to the forums there's like someone who says like it should be 90 10 like should be 90 dollars 10 governance again someone else says to be 50 50. but they all none of them have skin in the game right they're they're just saying like hey this pool of money should be changed this way but they have no skin in the game um and the idea here is you have to put up some skin in the game you make a portfolio uh and and build a track record of improving these kpis the Dow wants to improve now does that mean that can cover everything that is in treasury management uh no so like things like grants things that are qualitative like what does it mean to invest in the business which endows is very nebulous right like arguably even the grants are not clearly investing in the in the business of the Dow per se um but I think the the idea is that anything that is quantitative that a dow can give a quantitative answer to this is a way of allowing you to to get your participants to have skin in the game and you know vote on how your treasury should should look uh and then you know get rewarded or penalized based on how well they did um and so that in a nutshell is what era is I I try to give a very high level of read but we can dive in any to any level can you can you can we go a little deeper actually um because I tried to fully understand it last week but I want to keep going deeper so let's use an example so Lido has I'm just looking at this is from Deep Dao so I'm looking on deep down Lido has according to deep down 200 million in their Treasury you guys come in how does this work now how does the that 200 million get allocated who manages it how do you basically incentivize the management there yeah so let's say light so in Lido's case right um as a staking derivative they're sort of implicit uh safety issues like uh people might not be able to redeem right at some point in the future and the Lido Dow technically ensures that uh to some extent and so some staking derivatives like marinade on sauna I believe explicitly have a staked Insurance Fund um I think Lido doesn't right now but has definitely talked about it um but let's say lydo is like 20 percent of maybe let's just make it simpler let's say 50 so 100 million dollars is allocated to making sure that uh if there's ever any reason someone can't withdraw or some validator misbehaves and like causes a loss to people staking in Lido that people will get covered ninety percent of that treasury is in Lido so it's an ldo so uh you know they probably deposit ldo and then people would say would vote on hey based on how much ether is staked in Lido and how much light is earning in fees versus how much it's liable for uh there'd be some sort there'd be an objective function on chain that says like okay currently Lido's liabilities are 200 million dollars and currently our assets are 100 million dollars of ldo uh if we had to sell it maybe we'd only be able to get 80 million dollars of each so we're at the deficit of you know 120 million dollars so what would happen would be people would vote on portfolios like hey maybe we get some yield on ldo with 10 we vote on selling some fraction of the ldot into eth some fraction to usdc and then people get measured on how much that difference between asset liabilities decrease so suppose suppose you suppose the three of us submit portfolios that are different but um Michaels was the one that was actually like the best portfolio the three of us then he would get rewarded from the Dow so the Dow would pay some fees for that and the two of us would get slash potentially because we we gave bad portfolio but the idea is like everyone's getting graded repeatedly for that best portfolio based on highest return no so so that's the key thing is like it's done in a way where you the Dow provides an objective based on the Dallas goal I see best portfolio base and they're grade you're graded on based on how well you do on that goal and it needs to be an on-chain measurable goal so you can write a function that just takes on chain State and says like how and can grade you and give you a score yeah you ever talk to Richard from numerai about this yeah I tutored him in college you know Richard actually had an amazing call Richard came on the podcast like six months ago and was like I'm selling all my eth we're like Richard you're crazy looks pretty good now yeah he's been he's been very negative on crypto every time I've talked to him lately yeah yeah he did kind of also call the return to Market neutral hedge funds and I think a lot of honestly not that I really want to talk about Alameda but you go back and look at some of trabuco's old threads and you do see this change and Market neutral and clipping spreads to taking directional bets and that's probably a big part of the downfall of that particular fund but um I want to I want to get a sense as well to roon for I really like this framework that you have about treasury management making it so that your assets exceed your liabilities preferably entirely on chain I'd I'd be curious you know the one the one maybe little warning Bell I have in the back of my head is some of these Financial products are very complicated and it's very difficult to try to figure out how to incentivize people right maybe the most basic thing I could see happening in in this particular scenario say hey we want to maximize return but you should be doing risk adjusted return right which is a more difficult thing to do but something like how do you um you know I guess what's your level of do you worry about kind of the level of current Financial know-how in the space um and do you think we need to see more financial know-how kind of come in for this product to be successful yeah so I think the interesting thing is if we look at the last two years of funding and D5 there was quite a bit of money spent on basically building every Financial product that exists in traditional Finance in some form or another uh and and arguably the most successful D5 protocol is uniswap and use swap doesn't look like a normal traditional Finance like you know after many months of writing papers uh you know I think we you know people people like us proved some results that like it does look like some very complicated traditional product but it's not obviously like a normal Financial product in some ways [Music] um but one interesting thing and and I think this gets back to the point idea of like institutions are really important at being the Baseline liquidity for a lot of derivatives products is that every options protocol in defy every purpose protocol in defy they don't have any long-term buyers and sellers like people who want positions that they're holding for months and that is not super sustainable like that's fine in a bull market when like there's enough speculation-based demand to keep look you know liquidity there because it can earn yield but in a in a bear Market you need to actually have these kind of long-term buyers and long-term sellers to make sure that these products are liquid enough to make sure that they're safe enough and I think the goal I think of this bear Market in my mind for D5 is to figure out how to make these products that are very popular in centralized Finance have the ability to have similar pricing but like without any of the problems of the centralized uh versions which are like you have no clue what their real liabilities or assets are and I think the goal of this is to help Dallas bootstrap that right in my mind there's a lot of ways that Dows are supposed to bootstrap this network growth within between Dows right like almost like B2B in a way that like we haven't really done like there have been yes there's been like small token swaps here and there but facilitating that allocation of Dow assets to other dows is the only way you kind of get this like network of like Dows supporting each other and making the overall costs a lot cheaper um which then creates this nice feedback loop correct yeah instead of being these isolated you know parts of the world you know part of the part of sometimes how I describe defied people who are in finance but don't know much about it is the goal of Defy is to unbundle the Investment Bank right instead of having to like you know when you go do M A or IPO Investment Bank sells you five million products you probably only really wanted two out of the five million but they'd sell you the whole bundle right in a lot of ways you could think of each G5 protocol as like a desk at a bank right and but there are obviously synergies that Banks extract out of being in the same unit where you can like bundle these things and I think the key thing is to make tools such that people can create their own versions of that without having to get stuck with like the the you know the package deal you're always sold at Banks so uh maybe to just continue in Jason's line of questioning uh being a little bit prescriptive I mean is this is era a solution where you would recommend it maybe specifically for D5 protocols if like your Lidos or your office or your compounds of the world does it apply to every single you know I I kind of want to focus on those a little bit more just because I feel like maybe treasury management is a bit simpler if it's like a group of friends you know you know a smaller thing with less complicated uh you know structure but I guess yeah how you know what sort of recommendations would you make for aristot sort of a one-size-fits all or is it specifically geared towards D5 now but you see it expanding into different verticals over time yeah I think the two main objective functions we've worked on are one the this asset liability mismatch of like making sure that your treasury can adjust to the liabilities in a decentralized manner um the other is uh Runway management and sort of ownership in the network so Dows that are not necessarily defy dials generally have some notion of Runway that they they have right like how much do we need to spend in USD on contributors on marketing on whatever it is they also have some notion of how much they want the Dow to have ownership in the token like we want the Dow to never have less than 10 of the network or we want the doubt and never have less than 20 of the network and then they also want some notion of either some type of diversification now the diversification can be either Market beta to the rest of crypto so like maybe they want to own a bunch of eth and like eth and their governance token are the two things they're trading or they want some type of fully uncorrelated thing and they they own a bunch of USD and so those types of things are actually gen like you know I gave you four components maybe to your Dao you care 80 about ownership and ten percent about diversification and ten percent about um you know Market beta but for another Dao it's like 50 25.25 right those types of uh optimizations um can still use the same framework um and that sort of generic to many different different types of dials it's not just strictly this asset liability mismatch part of the reason we came up with this was you know as we were constantly running these simulations we would like run these simulations under different conditions and then noticed that some of these Insurance funds were insolvent uh that existed and couldn't handle like a an event you know I mean I guess this was like a year and a half ago so at that time no one really cared that much when you're like hey look if your thing goes down 80 you're insolvent of course yeah I guess mango was the one that learned that lesson the hard way but there are there are they're sort of like it was just this glaring hold us while we're analyzing things uh but I think the long-term goal is to make it so that you you know if you have an objective like something like we said like I said earlier you can optimize that so like someone like ens is a perfect candidate for that right they're like maybe we actually we want the Dow to always be owning at least 25 percent uh and we want to make sure we have enough USD and eth for X years of Runway and that's that's something where people compete to do that right versus like people writing in the forums like here's our allocation that you know that's a there's a lot of adverse selection because you're kind of telling everyone what you're doing like weeks before the Dow even votes on doing the thing B there's no skin in the game like people aren't like actually putting up Capital to like make these claims and I think the key is to make people have skin in the game in these things because the worst scenario is someone tells the Dow hey dump all of your governance tokens uh and only by USD and then the same person goes and takes the other side of that so they buy all of the governance tokens from the Dow and then now they own like outright ownership in the Dow and they can just keep voting on paying themselves right like they're sort of a very weird thing that happens if you don't force the treasury managers to also have skin in the game they can extract more control over the the Dow in the long run and so being extremely careful about avoiding that scenario is one of the main things we try to focus on I guess just uh I know we've got a wrap here soon but you know closing question and I know this isn't what we've largely talked about but actually focusing on sort of the 2.0 part of it which is how much do you redistribute to stake shareholders in in Trad Phi and and token holders and in crypto and how much do you invest in the future you know we talked we actually had Jason and I didn't recording on Empire with uh Kane Warwick and we talked a lot about just like what's the correct balance of yeah there was a big narrative a little while ago cash flowing protocols right protocols that return uh you know that returned funds to token holders and you know I'd be curious just you know what's your framework for kind of thinking about that because I understand the preference for that right uh but ultimately I think it's a allocation question of wherever you can produce the the highest return right compound value you should be doing that and for some of these earlier stage startups it's like why are you giving money back to token holders if you're a two-year-old company like can't you find Opportunities to invest in there I don't know if you see that outside of the realm of Treasury management or if you have an opinion on that but I'd be curious to see how you what your internal framework kind of is for that whole question argue that uniswap sort of beat out its competitors by never turning on its v-switch and that if it did turn on its V switch it may have like incurred a lot more adverse selection yeah um I think it sort of depends um like the point of a token to some extent and this is not legal or financial advice but it's to some extent like allow you to not have to distribute any share of earnings but always have some sort of ability to say you have a claim to it indirectly uh but I think I think the idea of like businesses that actually don't want to have a token so like the two ones that I think of most prominently for this are like flashbots or eigenlayer you do actually need to distribute cash because you don't have any way for people to speculate on the future cash flow of your thing right and like at some level all markets that have these securitizations turn into something where you're either speculating on future cash flow or it's like a zero-sum game like a derivative where like I buy one side someone else takes the other side and yeah that's it um so I think like there's sort of this weird thing of like I think if you are able to build up a sustainable community uh and if and fees even if the fees go down yeah you should probably just be reinvesting everything as long as possible in a growth industry um but if you're someone who's really antithetical to that and people view you as a sort of public good you probably need to start charging fees and returning them faster that would be my Trace like I think there's certainly this interesting thing crypto where like a lot of things are called public goods or try to be public goods but I think the value of a token is it actually ironically allows you to fund your public good for way longer if you have no token you probably need to start charging fees sooner right like someone like flashbots I think that will be more Salient for them in in like a few years that like they effectively have to start charging fees yeah I think you're probably right there Jordan has been great thank you man awesome appreciate you uh enlightening us on uh crypto's most interesting topic today which is treasury management a most interesting on chain topic yeah exactly that's been great man I'll uh thanks for coming on and uh yeah we'll talk to you soon sounds good cheers turn thanks all right buddy what'd you think great episode I knew that would be a good one um really liked his framework for like treasure management 1.0 2.0 3.0 and then 4.0 and um or like what was it 101 201 301 401 and uh like that that was my biggest takeaway is that normal startups not in crypto need to know 101 you're lucky if you get to 201 and you get into like share BuyBacks and dividends and things like that 301 is like very rare that you have to deal with that and then 401 like no one has to really deal with uh 401 unless you're like a public company or like a Fortune 500 or something in crypto that's kind of flipped on its head where you really don't have to do the 201 but you kind of if you're a protocol you go straight to the 301 and the 401 and that's probably my my lasting takeaway from that episode I I would actually say that I would have pushed back a little bit on tour and I think the 201 is always important you know at a high level what you're doing as a CEO or on the exact team is everyone's a capital allocator at the end of the day it's just kind of like where should we focus our resources so to speak um and I do think there's not enough discussion and we're going to be talking a little bit with in a later episode with Chris berninski about that but uh for the most part I thought the way that Turin thinks about things were very sophisticated you know know I think there are kind of two schools of thought when it comes to treasury management and maybe I could lay it out with uh I feel so bad for whoever's listening to this outro just listening to babies screaming in the backgrounds like what are you what are you doing it's pretty classic airport this is like two days before Thanksgiving I've got like a whole family of like it sounds like I'm not getting like 15 little kids like screaming directly into my ear all I need is a poopy diaper and this is perfect Thanksgiving travel uh fomo that sums it up nicely that sums up the year sums up the week okay so I think there are kind of these two schools of thought and I think both of them have a lot of Merit so there's sort of what Larry on one of our earlier uh episodes talked about he talks about this in musings on governance as well which is a very straightforward approach to treasury management which is that treasury management is a boring function it should be a boring function it's all about just preserving your cash flow and I think that's extremely appropriate to a lot of the different startups that you see in crypto today right it's kind of how we think about treasury management like we don't have customer deposits and all that kind of stuff man we don't need to hedge our risk out we're just like make sure we've got enough money to meet our expenses for know some predetermined period of time then there's the more complex requirements of something like compound or Navi where you do need to be taking into account right all treasury management is really making sure that your assets outstrip your liabilities and that your assets are denominated in the same way that your liabilities are so if you're something like compound and you've got you know a pool between you know ethereum and and usdc something like that then you actually need you have a liability that's denominated in ethereum and you need to have some part of your assets in that so I think that is where treasury management gets a little bit more complicated and where tarun's tarun structure was frankly very interesting I also thought did you I mean we only talked about this for a little bit but I thought it was very cool when he kind of brought up these Partnerships like token swaps between Dallas did you catch on to I mean I thought that was I mean I I heard it I I followed it 70 I'd say yeah so let's just say right now like let's try to put ourselves in the shoes of a dow we have maybe somewhere between 80 and 100 of our native token our Dows in our native token and maybe our native token has like some cases a million dollars worth of volume traded so basically I've got this enormous pile of basically my native token and extremely limited liquidity ability to get out of that that's not great right you probably have people that you're paying largely in usdc but there are some things that you can do with that liquid with that with those tokens one of the things is is you can incentivize you can use that token uh in in basically swap it with another protocol and to to create a partnership right so like let's say you're GMX or something like that and there's another platform where you're trying to Source liquidity from right one way that you could do that is like hey I'm gonna like spend dollars on marketing which converts you'd have to convert your native token into usdc and then spend it on marketing or you can just go to other pools of liquidity do a token Swap and then incentivize yeah you know basically being part of the partnership to bring liquidity onto the platform so I just think it's it's a pretty interesting way of leveraging an otherwise a liquid asset is probably worth something so yeah I thought that's pretty yeah that's that's interesting and yeah and that creates that nice positive feedback loop that he was mentioning yeah yeah I think the way I was listening and maybe tarun's going to listen to this and tell me that I'm not thinking about this in the right way but it almost the way that Troon conceptualizes some of these things and he actually did push back on when we said it's not necessarily appropriate to view these things as an endowment the way tarun seems to think about treasuries is they do sort of look like endowments right which is basically an endowment for a school you are trying to make your assets which is the pile of capital that you're managing as an endowment manager for school exceed your liabilities right which is kind of like what you need to put out every year for the school to pay for Financial what's what I'm looking for like you need to offset some of the tuition for the school for financial aid basically then there's also like donations where you can only use assets to build a certain thing so all these kind of walls in terms of what that what that money actually looks like and the way that endowments try to grow their assets that it exceeds the liabilities is they'll you know every endowment has a different strategy but they leverage managers like money managers and it seems like that's what tarun tarun's solution is basically doing where these pools of capital kind of have the ability to optimize for certain kpis based on the business but they're kind of farming out to different managers who will help you grow assets that you exceed the liabilities of the protocol kind of just a different way of looking at it yeah I mean I think that was a point that tarun was really trying to hammer home is that there are different goals and kpis of for each protocol right and I always think of kpis and like in like the growth sense of the word like you have Revenue goals and marketing goals I I guess it's a really good point like different there are a bunch of different treasury management strategies right like the treasury management strategy of a company growing at five percent a year really really different than like a SAS company uh who's trying to double every single year and when I when I think when people think about treasury Management Solutions in crypto today they think about okay you have a native token you should probably get that native token into something like usdc or you should get that into something that earns yield uh it's like these very simplistic strategies and I think tarun's vision of the future is the correct vision in that which is that there are a bunch of complex strategies going on here you're gonna eventually have it's it's not all about earning yield it's not all about protection of the asset into something like usdc there are a bunch of different strategies that people need to deploy here yeah you really want I mean I kind of think the most basic tenant of Treasury you need to make your assets match your liabilities so even what he was sort of describing with you know where corporate treasury management gets a little bit trickier right is if you're a large corporation with exposure to a lot of raw materials so say you're a BMW and an enormous amount of your percentage of your gross margin is dependent on the price of copper or steel or something like that you know steel will go up or down 50 to 100 every year you'll notice that the margins of BMW don't do that like what's the reason for that they go out into the markets they use Futures to hedge that exposure to their raw materials I think the crypto equivalent of that is basically a big big steel consultant here you know yeah dude I haven't mentioned this entire series that I used to be a consultant so I get so a few opportunities so if you'd like to plug that right in I got to plug it I gotta plug it so you know I think the crypto equivalent of that is probably the more appropriate way to think about it is uh almost like a bank basically and you're managing different durations you're managing different currencies I suppose that you that you denominate your risk in I thought I thought it was interesting he also made the point that you and I have talked about that proof of Assets in proof of reserves the way it's being thought of right now is basically just proof of assets for an exchange assets alone are useless that's like a balance sheet all you have is the asset lineup you've completely negated the liabilities right what matters for these exchanges in terms of their solvency is the ratio of assets to liabilities right so I thought he made a very interesting point there he also brought up I never really thought about it like this but the some of the harder to measure liability for some of these exchanges and probably applicable to Dows as well so like if you offer service to your customer base like giving them access to Financial product X Y or Z if that access results in the loss of customer funds even if it wasn't your fault even if you were just facilitating it that probably should be a liability that you should be putting on that you should be thinking about because you don't want to lose that business or like you don't want to damage your reputation you're going to have to make your customers whole so I think that's a very I think that should be factoring in frankly to more to more people's thoughts um and you know what on Ave do you remember a little while ago about two three months ago you started to see these proposals crop up in the governance forums uh where you're they were off-boarding certain layer ones right like Phantom and stuff like that so yeah they probably are thinking like that yeah yeah that's interesting yeah um who do we have coming up next we have Charles I think it's Charles St Louis and Jules uh just talking about this is gonna be a really interesting episode talking about the like The Cutting Edge of Dao governance and like experiments and Alpha uh happening in not just doubt governance but just Dows in general right now um and I think a lot of the experiments what I want to get out of this episode is a lot of the experiments and like weird stuff that you see in Bull markets like the successful crazy stuff ends up it starts as these like small little experiments in Bear markets usually there's like a group of 50 people paying attention to these experiments and Charles and Jules are the are the two people who are paying attention to these experiments closest so well I would say you know the the structures so Jules is at she's at Orca and Charles is at element finance and those two projects the the thread there between those two projects I think they have some of the most interestingly element the the structure that they're trying over there is very very Innovative I think just in terms of thinking about Dows and from from a first principle standpoint you know Jewel she she's one of one of the you know I think foremost voices basically on that on that line of uh on that line of thought so that that's what we're going to be you know so far we've sort of talked about okay what are the APT analogies and comparisons that we can make in between Dow governance and corporate finance and how should this work and now I think this this next episode is going to be okay what is possible in crypto in the form of thousands that was not possible before and what are some of the Cutting Edge experimentation that's going on so that's why we've got them coming on awesome true wrap rap baby all right see you guys next week [Music]
