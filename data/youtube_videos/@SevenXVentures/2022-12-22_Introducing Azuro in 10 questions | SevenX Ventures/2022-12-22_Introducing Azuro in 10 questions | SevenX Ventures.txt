[Music] azuru is the leading decentralized betting protocol that anyone can build on top of two problems azuru is a bit to be to see protocol and uh the first problem is a B2B problem azuro is essentially democratizing the business of vetting Azure is making it extremely easy for anyone to build a betting website in a permissionless way without any need for upfront capital or any know-how in terms of risk management of a betting service this is a dramatic Improvement uh comparing to how someone can start a betting service or a betting site today and then secondly azuru is a fully on-chain decentralized betting protocol that is trustless non-custodial and transparent this means that the zuru essentially addresses problems the centralized betting like lack of transparency lack of fairness client payouts or delayed payouts Etc to users so in that regard it is a dramatic Improvement in terms of the betting experience that users can get compared to what they can meet with centralized companies betting has been around for history says more than 2000 years so it really is an ancient activity it supposedly started in the ancient Olympics and a bet is like one of the first forms of contract between people so it is today a massive industry with allegedly more than two maybe even more than three billion people that place bets on sporting events at least once per year however this absolutely immensely popular activity and huge industry is plagued by lack of fairness and transparency essentially betting is a zero-sum game which puts the betting companies versus the players and pretty much all the power in that game is in the betting company's hands so it can become ugly at times at the same time betting was possible in a decentralized way for quite a while now actually decentralized prediction markets have been around since 2015 but they suffer from uh really poor user experience and basically no liquidity but bottom line is they don't work they are not a viable alternative to centralized uh betting so photos addresses the problems with both centralized betting in terms of the fairness and transparency Azure is fully on chain non-custodial and fully transparent and the problems with prediction markets by way of solving the problems with liquidity and the user experience so as a result with Azure you get something really unique but overall better non-custodial transparent more fair and we believe uh more fun as well azuru allows for the creation of a feed with priced and liquid betting markets on chain this feed basically acts like an on-chain B2B solution for anyone who wants to build the betting site that's the core of the model at the center of this model is a new liquidity pool design which is called the liquidity tree the liquidity tree allows for liquidity providers and data providers to interact on chain obviously the liquidity providers provide money in exchange for potential yield the data providers provide metadata about metic markets and they also provide pricing basically the odds of these Betty markets these two entities via the Azure set of smart contracts interact together and at the end of that interaction you have a feed with price then liquid betting markets so essentially at the protocol level we have these two parties LPS and data providers and then at the application Level there is the so-called front-ends or decentralized applications these front-ends can permissionlessly connect to this uh betting feed and you use it to create a UI maybe a website app widget really whatever where people can comment that and last but not least this part of the ecosystem is the token holders for adult when they essentially govern the secret system a little bit more maybe about the business model in azuru all revenue is uh generated and basically initially kept in the liquidity pool so in short the liquidity pool is used to bootstrap the liquidity in the betting markets so over time the liquidity pool basically makes profits so it grows in size and from these Revenue parts are going to the different participants in the ecosystem to reward them what they do in the ecosystem now the most popular prediction Market is is poly Market but just for extremely popular things like who's going to be the next president of U.S uh or something like that so the problem with prediction markets for betting and especially for sport betting is uh they are peer-to-peer in this model a market maker uh has to create the markets manually put their own money behind the market so they need to take risk and price the markets and on the other hand side you have somebody who comes and Bets in this on this Market this puts way too much pressure on the market makers and basically no markets are being created so liquidity is extremely scarce there's no events there's nothing to bet on so azuru is the first and currently the only uh protocol to utilize food liquidity for betting markets by a new liquidity pool design which is called the liquidity tree food liquidity basically scales betting markets just in a similar way like pool liquidity via the amm scale taxes this the liquidity triple is really a sophisticated piece of code that allows Betty markets to be priced then made liquid on chain and with the permissions and and I would suggest anybody who's curious especially like Developers more curious about this to check it out check the GitHub it really is uh not crazy but meaningful innovation kazuru does have the ingredients for a powerful Community down the line in two ways one what it does has meaningful positive impacts on society and particularly this part of society that bets and secondly it is also a revenue generating model and a protocol that can support its own governance and it will make sense for people to get involved and uh and participate in governance so I think these two things together are what's basically well enough to have a strong community over time once you realize that you have those you should not think that you have to basically bootstrap it artificially as I said Zulu is a pure token Project without governance but there's no token yet so at the moment the Dao is in let's call it the V1 we're members for contributors and influencers of the project Etc but as the project develops this will of course change and in the later versions of the dial it will be only for zero token holders so in that regard it's pretty clear there isn't a concrete plan that can be shared now but I would say that asexual grows in popularity and as the the protocol matures in terms of liquidity users front ends essentially basically establishing product Market fit the token is more and more needed but then beyond that what is really really great is azuru is a revenue generating protocol and there's many aspects in terms of how this ecosystem works that can be managed better through the presence of a token one example would be the liquidity in the liquidity pools the protocol needs liquidity in order to support the betting Market that it doesn't need too much liquidity so if the betting is on the protocol is X and then the liquidity is 10 times x then obviously nine parts of the liquidity are remaining unutilized so to manage such situations there can be some good and meaningful friction introduced through the token in order to manage the sizes of the liquidity pools there's other ways that are connected not so much the liquidity but also the betting where the token to to unlock some nice cities so I think beyond the governance there is really great opportunities to have the token uh work for the protocol in a meaningful way but of course this will remain to be to be determined and also as the dial progresses as a team we have a really deep knowledge and really deep capability and also Connections in the online betting World digital consumer products and in blockchain technology that mixture of people doing really unique expertise but be meaningful to to what Azure is trying to do I myself was exposed to online betting for a long time I let consumer business for a multi-billion global uh payments company for many years and it specialized in high risk payments so a lot of that was in connected to betting then perour another contributor to zuru he used to be a professional better himself and then he started the biggest online media for betting in Eastern Europe and then Dan who's behind the liquidity tree as the tech person he also used to be a pro better before he started coding in solid so to sum it up I think it really is a great combination of crypto web tree knowledge and capability and a deep understanding of beta as a business as well in terms of big names like uh Delphi digital Arlington Capital Alliance um ethereal Ventures hypersphere and uh and of course you guys and also we had key Partners slash investors like gnosis in particular which is just an outstanding team and uh have been very very active in in helping us especially on the tech side and also we launched the beta of azuro on gnosis chain Etc and uh yeah other projects like Merit Circle where we see like a lot of synergies down the line with Merit as a and um in terms of 7x I think you guys were very early and uh we're very very excited about this which we really appreciate it and then and you've turned out to be extremely Hands-On rarely I'd say proactive in trying to help both strategically and not even tactically and it's been definitely a good choice to have you on the cup table as well and we definitely look forward to having more positive and meaningful interactions foreign
