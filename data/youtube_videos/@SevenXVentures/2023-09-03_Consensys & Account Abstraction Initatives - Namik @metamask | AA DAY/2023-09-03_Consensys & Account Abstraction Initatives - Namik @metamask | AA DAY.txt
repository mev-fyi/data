so we've had a pretty interesting day I was lucky to be here for the whole time um I think it's first important to note the big whale in the room the elephant in the room I'm not an engineer right so I won't be able to give a particularly granular explanation on the intricacies of what we're doing at consensus but I think there's a more important message I want to share here and that's the general understanding of what consensus believes is the role of account abstraction and how we want to partner with all of you to do this so you know oh just forgot I have to I should stand here okay first up like what is consensus you know founded back in 2014 um effectively consensus has a very particular Mission and if you're in Centric mission right one that believes we can bring everyone on board onto web free and that's the ethos of what we're trying to do at consensus unlock the collaborative power of communities exactly so we have a lot of products I'm sure most people here are aware of this fact but there are two that I want to talk about in relation to account abstraction so that's going to be metamask um that's the eoa bad guy wallet that many people describe um it's what we want to do better then it has it also has 30 million monthly active users it has 100 million users in the past year and billions in assets right so when there's a large user base you need to be slow and make sure that the product that you offer works and it's safe and then there's the second aspect of our account abstraction journey and that's Linea um we're racing tomorrow become a type 2 zkevm uh it's Layer Two a main net is now live on Main net we've had around 3 million transactions on test net that number is 46 million we have over you know 150 million uh pardon me as I wish we have 150 Partners life so so a brief conversation around the count abstraction um I believe the team over at Alchemy today touched on how this is a buzzword um account abstraction is a design space and that's how consensus sees it yes there's a lot of cool teams building really really cool things but we believe that the way to win an account abstraction winning again is bringing all the users in is to actually partner together and build something that lasts so here's a quote from vitalik right basically saying at account abstraction has been the dream for a while and it's not like account abstraction has come to the four like this public Consciousness in the past year or two years you can have a smart contract wallet on a layer one teams have tried to do this in 2020. the issue is it's just way too expensive they all have to Pivot I believe the whole protocol team actually was an example of you know a smart team that was a bit too early um but effectively we have gotten to a place where smart contract wallets primarily the Advent of layer twos has become a bit more feasible right so you have externally on accounts everyone's talked about this today but I'll remind everybody EOS that's us controlled by a private key then you have this cool idea of a contract account right these are smart accounts controlled by code it's really really exciting the big thing that's brought a lot of this conversation into fruition was EIP and subsequently erc4337 it's been discussed here in detail by people who are way more prepared to discuss what the intricacies of 4337 are so instead of walking you through what it does and what implications are I want to talk to you about how about how consensus is working with this technology and the standard so we'll sort of linear by the way it says metamask over there idubbd for both linear and Mathematics so if you guys are interested let's talk I'd love to uh Vinnie is super bullish on account abstraction why is that well it's going to make things a lot easier for users now that also means there's a lot of ways to go about this a lot of layer twos think hey you know what we really like account abstraction let's bake it natively we considered this right so we actually spoke to a lot of the offers and strategies or the offers of 4337 and effectively came to the conclusion that even though we there's a lot of Prost embedding native functionality we wanted to really track and enable upgradability alongside 4337 and all the standards that build around that as a result we decided against going with a native abstraction model for linear so that we don't have to diverge from where this ecosystem can take us it's a design choice you know it's not better or worse than any other one but it's the choice we've made um how are we approaching account abstraction on linear well with awesome teams like myconomy who just spoke prior to me alongside you know Pimlico cyanide uh if if your spot I believe is the name uh we again believe that account attraction is a design space it's not up to consensus and linear to decide what this looks like we want to partner with stakeholders that know what they're doing this is their primary business and finally enables a developer like yourself a hacker like yourself to plug into all these different players all of their fantastic infrastructure to build a product that will actually bring users in you know fingers crossed so what does that mean well we as a team really like account abstraction we're not going to force you to do anything but we really like the idea of you using it and we kind of really really encouraged during testnet a lot of our partners to integrate account abstraction into their quests right so that would be pancake swap Sushi swap velocore compound I think there were a few more in there but these are the names that you'll you'll be aware of and the result was we had a million a enabled user operations in just two weeks on testnet um again if anyone wants to see more about this happy to Circle and afterwards send you guys the relevant details that's where we are we have a lot more coming in the future end of this year we want to make a big push towards a lot more unique account abstraction enabled Primitives experiences but again that's not happening today and there's not too much more I can tell you about it so what about the little fox I love this term by the way for metamask uh I think it's really sweet well again right eoa wallet when will you become a smart contract wallet uh all of these cool Concepts which unfortunately I can't we don't have to the entire picture today to share with you but we have a lot of really really cool things coming extremely soon and that's me dropping Alpha right there so account abstraction is possible now with snaps which is currently on flask but it is coming to extension again very soon especially if you're a conference person you'll see it you'll see some cool announcements first and foremost again I'm not the domain expert here if you want to get way more granular this is the guy that you should be listening to Alex Jupiter he'll also be a token 2049 uh we'll have a lot of members of the team at permissionless as well talking really deeply about snaps um regardless I will try and do what I can um so what is the goal of metamask with snaps well again as I'm mentioned before we look at account abstraction as a design space but it goes further than just account abstraction we look at this ecosystem as a design space instead of trying to build walled Gardens right where we decide to experience for users we want you guys to build with us right and that's best conceptualized of snaps snaps allows anyone to extend the functionality of metamask in a way that is security centralized and keeps users in control we've spoken about this for years now right so you might think uh  like this is never coming announced in the eve Tokyo 2019 it's exciting that you can finally build a snap right and that's going to really really really come to the average user in a way that we're excited to see what that experience can even feel like right um we think it's the most important feature in the permissionless view of method mask that contrasts with like portfolio and more user friendly experience right uh so what exactly is this snap well it's an execution environment right that's inside of metamask and it can plug into really where whatever you imagine right it's up to you to decide what it wants to be but by default zero permissions the user has to plug in and enable every single part of this user experience and it can have its own API use methods within method mask and can even have like native methods to the step itself right so you can create an entire model for your snap that can exist as that can exist at its own you know business of sorts right so we're already seeing teams build snaps for Cosmos we have them with starknet uh file coin and you know there's really cool things you can be doing not AA related I'll get into that but cross chain to everything like it's very fun so what is this snap how does it work well it's an npm package source code manifest package.json button going to a single Javascript file published to an npm and made available for any from it from an app uh what does this look like for users well it's really really smooth uh and you know you can argue that this has been the weak spot of method mask creating you know very smooth experiences but we're working on it this is what a user sees you get a clear understanding of what is happening um and you're able to kind of participate with that uh how does the distribution look like well you know you publish a snap you deploy adapt invite users to install your snap will adapt invokes your snap mathematical prompt users to install your snap right um after this you'll basically be able to categorize collect all of your snaps see what you have plugged in and other adapts can then use this snap too right so it creates a really really cool flywheel for yourself and whatever team you you're a part of um how is this relevant to account abstraction um you know it's a neoa wallet but people are building lots of really cool things you can work with you can leverage right by economy Pimlico all of these guys to build cool account abstraction snaps right so that's really exciting um Alex which is Alex Jupiter right you can find him on YouTube showcase the erc4337 delegator snap demo uh you can watch Dan Finley co-founder of metamask he's obsessed with this idea of the delegatable right and there's a really great video from East Denver that I recommend you watch if you want to learn more about this uh and then again as I mentioned you can leverage existing AA infra to build your snap you can work with this AAA infrastructure to build really cool apps on slinia and finally like if you're a fan of like the mobile approach mobile snaps isn't beta as well um I guess the final conclusion from this BD dude is we think it's a design space we want you to feel comfortable building with consensus build alongside metamask build on top of linear we have a lot of initiatives to help Empower you guys to do this and you know we don't want to create a Walled Garden we should build this as a community so that we can actually get users on train so yeah that's it very fast paper boy should have walked through the slower if you want to track my Twitter is namik madraglu on on Twitter my telegram is just nomic m so n-a-m-i-k-m always open for a conversation and yeah I'm here if you have any any questions about our strategy how we're looking at all good uh how we're looking at stuff on linear how we're looking at stuff on metamask and if you want to you know chat them here cool [Applause] any questions please sorry um thanks thanks BD dude good good job thanks Ryan all right I have a BD question so sure what's the pitch then to like an application team that you would partner with like it seems like Marinette has a big brand you have a distribution like what else do I get besides so are you asking me why would I want to build on linear or are you asking why I would want an integrative metamask okay yeah that makes total sense so I think the main value proposition here is as follows the tech is cool right uh but to be completely honest the tech is really cool at scroll and polygon ckvm everyone is Cool Tech I think the main value proposition is the consensus Suite right we have built we know how to build and we are working natively with metamask to create really really cool interactions around the concept of abstracting the wallet with linear right the two teams are in touch co-building a go to market strategy for some of the more you know account abstraction native tooling for metamask yeah I guess another point is also like there's 40 million monthly active users on metamask and in a future where people I mean I think you can best equate it to like the way bass has a relationship with coinbase wallet right so if we see a world in which layer twos also manifest in this manner you can trust that metamask and linear will work closely to create a more vertically integrated stock user experience that we know is safe yeah yeah how do you think like EOS and Smart Connect worlds would exist in the future how do you guys think always so so you mean a complimentary to one another or yeah or like like five years yeah so I can talk about my personal opinions fortunately we can't talk too much about like the plans for metamask but I mean it goes I think someone said it really wisely right we want to get to a world where we're all using smart contract wallets in a trustless manner there's nuances there right so I think that it's going to be a multi-year process to fully um Branch out and become like smart contract based wallet but metamask is very much aware of the values of you know scas and we're building towards that future yeah please I remember you mentioned uh that you're going to bring all the snap technology to the mobile phone I wonder if you like considering expanding to the Apple like a system or you're seeing some obstacles that will prevent you from doing that yeah I mean it's a great question right so apple is famous for wanting 40 of anything that it touches which means 30 of transaction fees right which is a horrible experience for users I think one of the Prides of consensus is like we will do work with Apple so it's definitely like a big vision of ours to participate in that ecosystem like we have metamask mobile which is an app it's on the app store right and you have those transactions so yes is the answer to your question yeah got it please oh with the extension like Snap coming out like very soon yes very soon yeah no 100 I can guarantee you it's this year this year like one billion percent this year quadrillion percent this year I mean you must have heard this for a while dude right like every every single time there's a presentation oh snap snaps but I can tell you it's even closer than this year yeah awesome cool anything else guys awesome well thank you very much
