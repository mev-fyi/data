um so yeah indeed I mean um today you will have probably um many very interesting talks on account abstraction and I'm sure that the speakers and great companies we speak just after me um will go in many details in erc437 and what is account attraction and ethereum layer 1 and most evm compatible chains but I also want to bring maybe another perspective to the table today and really talk about Native account abstraction and why at Argent we made a very big bet on Native account of fraction so my name is Antoine sparenberg I'm ecosystem lead at Argent you have my Twitter there for those those who want to know and I just first thought very quickly about myself for a few minutes so you have a better understanding of who's speaking to you today I just want to go very you know quickly through my journey from working in a traditional industry to what I'm doing today at Argent I I understand there are also students here and I think that's always very interesting to understand so um I did a master in International Management so I don't have a technical background I have business backgrounds at the luvan School of Management which is located in Belgium so for those who hadn't noticed I'm a french-speaking yeah basically and then once I you know graduated I started first working for a management consulting firm called PMP PMP strategy which was working in basically helping European Telecom operators Finance their new generation networks which are 5G networks and um and uh like fiber optic networks and I like to tell that because I see many similarities between what we do in the blockchain industry and what these people do in the Telecom industry in both instances you have this you know communication networks in my opinion a blockchain is a communication Network and you have then you know more and more use cases coming and building on top of these networks more and more people coming and using them and at some point you end up with scalability issues right and so in the telecommunication industry they had to find new ways new networks to accommodate for this new scalability they needed and well in blockchain we see we see that's also something we've been working on for the past years um first with this you know alternative layer ones and now we speak more and more about layer twos of ethereum and even we start talking about layer 3s and then after some time I I went you know working for this company called AB inbev which you probably all know because it's the biggest beer maker in the world so I have you know put a few of their products there uh Stellar advisor Corona you probably all know them and in there I worked in logistics I stayed only a few months I really hated it that was my first experience with a multinational company and after sometimes I really decided I had to get you know out of there and start working on something that would have a real impact something that has you know something at stake and that would have well yeah basically impact and that was that was you know uh Missing there um you know moving beer from point A to point B is is important but not that important um and so I decided to go full time uh into into web 3 so first as a freelance blockchain and web3 Consultants I worked on a few projects the Smurf Society for example which is the the official nft collection of the Smurfs I co-organized the Brussels blockchain week and uh about six months ago I became ecosystem lead at Argent now I'd be interested to know um here who knows Argent already okay quite a few people and who has used Argent already okay so not bad it's not bad so I really I don't want this presentation to be about Argent but still I think it's important you know just to uh have everybody on the same page and also to understand because the history of Argent is very uh related to the history of account attraction as we have said account attraction is not a it's not that new actually it's been there for quite some time and Argent has been there from the beginning as well so Arjun was founded in 2018 um and basically you know the founders back at the time already realized that the ux in web 3 was not good was bad and that we had to find new ways um to improve the ux to have you know to reach Mass adoption and bring more people to blockchain and so they decided to do that with with account abstraction um uh and so they launched Argent and so Argent was first a mobile mobile app on ethereum level one we still have that mobile app on ethereum Leo one but after basically quickly the founders also realized that ethereum layer one was not the best place for Mass adoption and that it was not I mean the best place in terms of I would say scalability but also not in terms of adoption of account attraction and so they decided to refocus Argent on layer twos and more specifically on ZK rollaps with a specific focus on layer twos which have account abstraction natively embedded and to date you have two two layer twos which have those two properties which are DK sync and Stark Nets and so agent today is still you know this this mobile app for ethereum we still have it for SDK syncline decasing era and very soon for stagnet when I say various units in the coming hours and coming coming days you will be able to use Darkness with your Argent Mobile Wallet we also have a few other products Argent X which is a an extension for starknet we are the biggest wallet on stock net with 80 market share and then yeah a few a few more products as well we also have a nft markets Marketplace on stock net that's a bit unrelated for today so in terms of agenda I think people here many already know what is a new way what is you know a contract account what is the difference between those what is account attraction what are the use cases of account attraction so I won't talk too much about that what I want to discuss today is the the case for smart accounts so why do we need smart accounts it's a bit related to the the previous points as well of course um the case for Native account attraction why we made this big bet at Arjun to focus on Native account attraction chains and then um have a short discussion on how we already unlock account abstraction on stocknet today so it's not it's no secret that the ux of web 3 is really hard right and there are many reasons to that but I think we have summarized there like the three main reasons the first one is that security relies on the user secret right so non-custodial wallets um require the users to keep a secret it's a seed phrase 12 or 24 words and basically you know the seed phrase is a new camera when you start interacting with the blockchain and that's the first thing you see right that's it's just in front of you this is pushed by the wallet telling you if you lose that seat phrase uh basically your facts you lose all your fans so from a user perspective um you would tend to have as many copies as possible of that seed phrase but at the same time if somebody else gets access to the to your seed phrase you also lose your funds right so from a user perspective then you don't want to have any copy of your citrus and mainly keep it probably in your brain somewhere I don't know about you but I don't I don't stress my brains enough to do that so first issue second issue is that users can't make mistakes right so if you make a typo in an address when sending funds you lose the funds in some instances if you send the funds to the right address but on the wrong Network you lose the fence if you send a transaction in a malicious website you lose you lose your money um if you you know use a computer which has a malware that is targeting crypto on it you are very likely to use your friends as well so web3 does not forgive and then everything is too complex right so in web 3 users will interact with you know complicated Financial Primitives most of the time they don't even really understand what they do and the ux does not do anything to help them um so every operation requires multiple transactions such as erc20 approval volt migration LP rebalancing complexity is just everywhere in web 3. and so there I just put a few examples this is a slide from one year ago so it's not in July and August this year but uh because of the issues I just mentioned people lose their fans and the people I have used as example there they can probably be considered to be power users of web free right people who know what they're doing who know what are the risks we know how to overcome these risks and even though they are power users they still manage to to use their funds and so um it seems very complicated that people uh you know mainstream people who are not Security Professionals or funds storing professionals will be able to use web 3 without having the same issues and so what are users doing today they are basically turning to centralized Solutions right again this is a graph that is a bit old from 2022 today you could say uh in web 3 when you have power users uh anymore so it basically basically means that uh numbers are no that's that's uh problematic anymore but I would argue that with the next waves of newcomers maybe in the next bull market in 2025 I hope um I think these numbers are going to be even worse than we have there now right and so why do these users switch to centralized Solutions basically because they offer familiar web to ux web 2 has been there for a long time the ux has been refined has been polished people are used to it we have a pretty good ux in web 2 right and so this centralized solution they will offer basically easy onboarding so there is no app to install uh login with email and password like you would do everywhere in web 2 no transaction fee you don't need to have if in your in your I don't know coinbase accounts um to to trades usdc for die there is a easy recovery when you lose access so first of all you don't have any c trade right there is this forgot your password flow that everybody knows in web 2 that is very easy you forget your password well there is this phone backup it's not a big deal sometimes you don't even you know bother remembering the password because you know that there is this backup there is risk detection in 2fa so on binance typically if you send a huge chunk of fans or if you send funds to an address that you haven't interacted with before you will be asked for 2fa and then everything is in one click right everything is easy you don't need to do any erc20 approved if you want to to spend your if on coinbase and so what or why are well you know users doing this and turning to centralized solution I think it's mostly because um for now EOS they basically impose this trade-off you know between self-custody and user convenience and as long as we will have this trade-off uh self-custody will lose simply users need convenience right so what do you think is going to happen in the next uh in the next years when there is going to be mass onboarding in World 3 and crypto do you think that we will maintain the current self-custody system where users need to manage their seed phrase It's inconvenient it goes against history historically speaking people who just have gold under the mattress right but very quickly they have changed that and now they're using Banks if it's not convenient people not convenient people don't do it or are we gonna move towards custodial services like we have seen there is a trend already where users were will delegate their key management uh it's much much more convenient but the problem is that we onboard the mass of people to web3 using decentralized solutions that are very close to what we have already in the in the banking ecosystem so can we offer the best of web to ux in web3 of course you know the answer is yes that's why the question is there um and the answer is yes thanks to account abstraction now account abstraction is not very easy to Define it's not something that's been defined very well some people will tell you it's abstracting um the signer away from the account that's right but it's a bit complex to understand some other people will tell you it's abstracting the complexity away from the user again that's that's right but it's a bit vague actually account abstraction is simply using a smart contract as an account and once you do that you can build basically any logic into your account and you can add a layer of intelligence to that account and using that layer of intelligence you can improve ux so just to come back on a few of these you know examples of centralized Solutions easy on boarding well on stagnet we have what is called Argent web wallets which is AKA The Invisible wallets where you would simply you know log in with a an email and a password so it's seedless you don't have a seed phrase anymore fully non-custodial still Arjun does not have access to your friends and then a few a few other benefits but so that's possible with a kind of traction risk detection and 2fa are still on stagnet we have Argent Shields which is a 2fe in some cases you will be required you know 2fa by email or by um by let's say by phone number it could be also with your authentication app on your phone and what is important I think with 2face to have this built-in transaction review system where the wallet will be able to review your transactions and depending on the risk ask you for 2fa or not so typically if you interact with adapt that is on a blacklist you should be notified and probably used to fa if you interact with adapt that is on a white list or that is you know known as a valid dab then you should be told as well no worries it's probably a legit app if your transaction is a bit Shady typically we see a lot of scams happening at the moment where um you will you know swap some tokens but the the destination address is not the same as the original address right so then the the wallet should be able to tell you there is something Shady with your um with your transaction if you still want to go on please do a 2fe easy recovery where same so social recovery and Guardians I love this phrase here which says that basically when you lose your credit card you just call the bank you freeze it and you get a new one right and that's exactly the same kind of you know mental model that we want people to have in what three uh but without the bank without the centralized uh institution right and so you can choose who you want to trust it can be friends and family it can be a 2fa authentication a hardware wallet you could still have a hardware wallet on the side that you only use to help you recover your accounts when it's lost and so you don't even need funds on your on the other wallet so yeah good Solutions with account at freshen and then everything is in one click that's of course possible with multi-color now I know there is a lot of emphasis that is put on intents this week to be frank I didn't really know what intents were before you know preparing for this talk and so I did a bit of research and I I actually I love it I also understand you know the definition of intent is not very clear um but that's basically what I would call a user action right the user wants to do something doesn't care about what is happening under the hoods in the in the engine how many transactions you need to do that that's that's none of the usual business well with multi-code it's totally doable right so with just one signature you can have many different calls in one transaction so yeah that was for for account abstraction and I think everybody here agrees and maybe not um sometimes you also have people who don't agree that account attraction is really needed um in in the web 3 space now what about Native account abstraction to talk about that I just want to take maybe you know a step back and have a look at how a transaction uh flow works on ethereum this is with the newly so a new way transaction the user will sign a transaction with the with a ecdsa signature which is the default signature on ethereum transaction is going to be sent to the main pool picked up by a validator and then if valid is going to be added to a block right um but then some people as we said decided smart people probably decided okay what if we we could actually do account attraction and use Smart contracts as a count right and as you know a smart contract cannot initiate a transaction only a New York can do so right and so they came with this workarounds that was before erc4337 so that was already a long time ago um Argent actually used to to work like that where the user would not sign a transaction but would actually sign a message and then with an arbitrary signature that we be used is not easy DSA per default and that message would be sent to a relayer the relayer would simply be actually a new a centralized eoa so able to initiate a transaction the message is is put in a in a transaction by the relayer the relayer signs the transaction sent to the main pool to the validator and then the message will be recovered by the smart contract wallet for execution good but hey this relayer is centralized right so that's not perfect and it's not that good and so we had to come up with something better I guess even smarter people came up with that and that is called erc4337 right we've been talking a lot about that in the past months what erc4337 does is that it introduces this um concept of bandler right and what happens now is that the user will sign not a message not a transaction but a user operation that user operation is sent to an alternative mempool where you have all user operation and then the bundler will pick up user operations and we'll bundle them together in a vendor transaction the Bender is decentralized so anyway theoretically any anybody could run a bundler I think the business models of banner still have to be refined but anybody could do it then the blender transaction is sent to the mempool it is picked up by the validator and before reaching the user smart contract wallets it has to go through what is called an entry point smart contract which will unbender the transaction and send the user operation to the right smart contract wallet so that's of course much better is decentralized still it's not perfect it's not at the protocol level as you see it's outside of the the ethereum protocol but implementing implementing this at the protocol level would be a lot of work and so that's so far the best we have found and so if we zoom out a bit more basically that's what a transaction flow looks like on ethereum with erc437 whether a transaction comes from a new way or from a smart account it all goes to a mempool and then it's picked up by by a node that's before erc437 sorry um but it has it had to go through the relay right and so with erc437 we decentralize a relayer and we kind of introduce a second transaction flow right so transactions that are initiated by EOS they follow the same flow as before they go to main pool picked up by a node and then on chain while transactions coming from Smart accounts well they do this you know different journey and the thing is they have to go through the entry point contracts otherwise the vendor transactions cannot be unbended right and that is that is a problem that is a problem because it makes account abstraction adoption only possible if dapps duplicate their ux and let's take an example here with pay masters which is a very good example of um of account abstractions so for those who don't know pay masters they enabled apps to pay gas fees for the users or the users to pay gas fees in any currency any token they would have not especially the the base token um the paymaster they will interact with the entry point contract so that means that on ethereum with erc4337 if you have an UA you cannot interact with openmaster right it's not it's not the same the same flow if you want to do that you have to interact with a smart account so dapps if they want to you know provide an experience with pay masters they will have to detect whether the user is using an AOE or a smart account if the user is using an eoa then they can only offer the flow that we all know today that is not that good and there is no paymaster if the user is using a smart account then the dab can adapt basically the user flow the user experience the the the UI to make the master happen and I mean that works with multi-cool that that works with anything related to you know account abstraction features the problem is we believe that origin that dapps won't do that before a very long time before because that's the basically builds the build for the users and the users for 90 you know five percent of them are still on EOS for users to go to smart accounts and to use Smart accounts the experience that adapts will provide to small accounts needs to be you know adapted needs to be better than the one that is provided to EOS but they will only do that if there are users on Smart accounts so it's a chicken and egg problem um and so to date most apps they don't build with account attraction in mind it's been you know around for months at least weeks but the experiences that are built by dapps are still tailored to EOS and not smart accounts and so just to give maybe an exam to give an example of how you know inertia works and how long that can take the example of EIP 1271 that is mandatory if you want you want your dab to be compatible with smart accounts because it has to to do with smart contract signatures you need to be compatible with EIP 1271 right it's an EIP that's has been around for five years since 2018. but to date many dabs still don't support AIP 1271. I have put a few a few of them there you see big names if you go to eip1271.io you will see that the list is longer than that and these are only you know the biggest apps but there must be hundreds of the apps that are still not compatible with EIP 1271 while so that means they cannot even interact with the smart accounts on Smart accounts users cannot interact with these dabs and it's been five years um so at origin we really believe uh it's gonna take a lot of time for dabs to First be compatible with smart accounts that's one thing it's not done yet and then to offer users an experience that is tailored um to account abstraction and so the next question is what if we could take erc4337 one step further to unlock the full potential of account attraction so it would need to be you know built on ZK roll ups so it's scalable it will need to be integrated at protocol level so there is no compromise no centralized relay or no off-chain protocol bundler and then we would need to have this single mempool and transaction flow so smart accounts become first-class citizens um and uh in the transaction flow there is one uh Network that did that it's called decasing error and as you can see the transaction flow and error is very much inspired by erc4337 right so you have a uni basically transactions coming from EOS and smart accounts they all end up in the unified mempool then it's picked up by a bundler which is called an operator on era and then they still have to go through this entry point contract called a bootloader on era and while paymasters will interact with the bootloader so that means that on decasing error even if you use a metamask an eoa you can still benefit from theme as your experience because your transaction flow still goes through the entry point contract so that is pretty good of course you don't have all the benefits of smart accounts I think you don't have multi-cool you cannot do you know a social recovery Etc but from it in that perspective if I want to offer paymaster to my users I just have now to build one experience one ux one UI and both EOS and product cons users will be able to benefit from it so it's much easier from a Dap adoption perspective but you can still go one step further right and so there is this other blockchain that is called stock Nets and stagnet they did something pretty you know amazing so it's it's Ezekiel roll up for those of ethereum for those who don't know and they decided to basically just start from a blank sheet so they have a dedicated language that is called kaijo and virtual machine which is called the Cairo virtual machine which is optimized for provable programs so it's optimized for zero knowledge proofs which is what stagnet does it's a ZK roll-up right um I mean it's it's a huge bet as well from their their side because it's not evm compatible so it's much difficult much more difficult for Builders to build stuff on stagnet they have to learn a new language Cairo from scratch the documentation at the beginning was not that good on solidity you have you know tons of documentation and it's not easy to Simply Fork an application that is on another ezm compatible chain and bring it to stagnet so it doesn't work like this you need to rewrite everything and the other big bet they did is to go 100 fully native account abstraction and so that means that on stagnet you don't have EOS anymore they don't exist you only have Smart accounts as you see basically I mean the flow is also very much inspired by erc4337 but all users benefit from account abstraction or dabs builds with account attraction in mind they build your experiences leveraging what you can do with account attraction because that's what that's all there is basically so smart accounts are are the only citizens still in town on stock Nets so that makes account abstraction a de facto reality and so I just that's the last slide I just want to to to finish off with that and that sentence that says intents are already a reality on stagnets um and so I mean this is basically a demo of a swap I did on Avenue which is a DEX aggregator on stagnets and so from a user perspective my intent there was simply to swap 0.0 to ease and get as much die as possible in return right and so Avenue the DAP took care of you know finding the best route the best rates to get me as much die as possible and me as a user I yeah I haven't it's not on the screenshot but I only had one button to push just the swap I push the Swap and then everything is happening uh behind the scenes in a multi-call so that is what whether people you see that I'm gonna exchange 0.0 to Eve for some die and then in the actions two actions um yeah you know behind that button which are the approval of the erc20 token and then the swap in itself but that means that from a user perspective we could have I don't know well intents or user actions that would require 10 15 maybe 20 different transactions or calls let's call them calls from a user perspective it's only one action and that's what is important and then yeah here I just wanted to show this as well um so if you extend that ethereum box there you see that the ERC token the rc20 token so the if that has been approved is exactly the amount that I wanted to swap right I wanted to swap zero upon zero two I will approve 0.02 simply because we can put behind you know or in a transaction as many cores as we want every time the user will want to swap again there is going to be there is just gonna be another erc20 approval the user the user doesn't care but from a security perspective it's much better right you don't have to infinite approve anymore you don't have to put you know type in their crazy high numbers because you don't want to be bothered by by the approvals and so as a conclusion um the ux of web 3 can be on par with centralized Solutions if not even better thanks to account attraction the masses they care about convenience and account attraction is how we will bring them convenience and how we will bring them to web 3 adoption of a contact abstraction requires a strong paradigm shift I was saying there you know Define new paradigm that's not easy to define a new paradigm uh within the blockchain community and so this this shift is going to take a long time that's already today on some chains with Native account abstraction embedded um well they are getting ready to onboard the next billion users that everybody's talking about yes in order so I just want didn't want to to stop without sharing maybe a few good reason I can't abstraction so uh if you want want to know more about the topic these are very good articles what the is account abstraction part one two and three by uh Julian from audience why we need wider adoption of social recovery wallets by vitalik smart contract wallet redefining web for ux by Anna from hashtag Capital this is a very good article and account abstraction pass present and future by by metamask so yeah that's it I'd be very happy to answer questions if I can bring any questions so how do you like standardize the native account extraction with the construction of software different communities is it different that's what like how are you because definitely you need you don't need bundles and stuff there right so like standardization of pay masters on like native account obstructions how do you guys see about it uh standardization um yeah I mean that's that's of course a good question uh I mean I actually focus on stock net today we used to mainly on stagnet yes we used to work a bit on ZK sync I mean standardization yeah how does does it happen at which level we are uh basically bringing all these chains in the same application that's one way of seeing uh standardization um yeah so you show the chart about the number of users of centralized services that's one of you uh yeah wherever you guys are and in terms of producer adoption so you know how many users yeah yeah so just to give you an idea yeah I mean users in blockchain always very difficult to Define right um on Argent X which is our new extension for uh stagnet we have one million downloads no 1.5 million downloads and 1 million funded accounts because it's not exactly the same so we could say 1 million users but probably most use many users have multiple accounts but I think these are very good very good numbers thanks for the presentation I'm really insightful I'm curious to hear a bit about how you you envision the kind of proliferation of daps on Stark net right you know unique applications unique use cases and the role of origin is a wallet and facilitating the most you know the best ux you know Arjun was one of the first uh really strong AAA wallets how do you guys look at like wall abstraction on Stark nets for naps is that something you're even talking about so what do you mean by what it obstruction exactly you know in an Ideal World right like I wouldn't have to go to a tour when I go on to adapt and have to click oh you know like Argent yeah go and use Arjun to interact with my dad I think I just interact with the doubt An Origin supported that story is that something you're I may have missed it by the way but no it's a very good question indeed that's that's something that's going to happen it's it's part of the the onboarding flow of users um yeah wait I don't think I have the right feature here uh uh that is basically this one is so it's our you know Argent web wallets um when you use adapt you will basically have that right so you can just uh use your email passwords and you log in into the dab um it's persistent across the apps so this is linked to your um to your browsing session so if you remain in the same browser you use another app that is also compatible with web wallets you are automatically logged in and you don't really see the wallets anymore you can there is a dedicated page the each user has a dedicated page you can go to that page and you will see your friends in there but otherwise you don't see your friends the the dab can decide to display the phones if they want they can you know display whatever whatever they would want but indeed for some dabs and we are very bullish on stagnets um with gaming uh as well with gaming probably you know you don't really know um to see to have to know that you have a wallet to see your wallet you want to do trading or anything um so you just need to approve maybe transactions and at some point when your wallet is empty because you have spent all your money then you need just to top up that's typically the kind of use case we could have so is this like yes this is life it's live on starknet the embeddable wallet functionality exactly yes okay yes it's I think what seven dabs do the the biggest apps on stocknet have have it already stagnet is still a small ecosystem um but the biggest deaths have it yes um yeah yeah um for designer for their web wallet I know they like username password yeah so that's very complex and cryptographic stuff we actually we just wrote an article that will be published I believe next week um yeah so part of the key is in the browser uh part of of it is in argent's uh back end it's it's a bit of an NPC construction but it's not really an MPC construction but I am not able to tell you exactly where it is The Vault are the wallets you mean this one I remember it was like a like a check that like about 2020 . yeah so so what exactly so what you're talking about is Arjun Vault on ethereum layer one and this is also part of the reason we decided to go to ZK Roll-Ups but indeed the the having a smart account on ethereum is very expensive transactions on ethereum are very expensive when it's a smart account you have all that logic that is you know added to your account and that makes it even more expensive to uh to send a transaction um the way we Market today is that this is a wallet for uh you know wealthy individuals people who will keep quite a lot I don't know 50k maybe already worth of value in the wallets that is on ethereum layer one um because we think well obviously like most people that we need layer choose to scale and that's how that's where it's going to happen for the for Mass adoption oh two I don't know like 30 cents on stock Nets yeah no there is no migration so maybe that's uh that's a bit related to the previous question these are different uh different accounts you have different accounts in the same app basically any reason why they just started yeah I mean it's yeah it's basically it's it's native and there there is no eoa there is no eoa so all dabs build with a counter Traction in mind and we are a smart accounts wallets so that's what we want of course um it's it's much easier so on stock not everybody uses account attraction already on ethereum layer one and most evm compatible chains is not the case the numbers of smart accounts that are deployed is extremely extremely low so my question can follow up with a couple of questions I think before so you're saying is right now Ireland is just to go straight forward more for Stockton right there won't be like a that much the same effort and like in taking think of others but like it next time like regarding on the ecosystem so as I say you guys are going to more attracting I mean maybe totally brand new developer coming to F3 and building up games or something we don't have it now or are you still trying to bring some you know old folks like Insurance other chance to there I mean because it seems like a totally too different to pass away yeah so it's it's a bit of both um I mean we are convinced that stagnet is one of the best Solutions uh you have out there so we try to bring you know people you also want to hear more about that powerful Viewpoint of you okay I think we're running out of time so you can definitely find Anthony in person as question okay thank you thank you thank you
