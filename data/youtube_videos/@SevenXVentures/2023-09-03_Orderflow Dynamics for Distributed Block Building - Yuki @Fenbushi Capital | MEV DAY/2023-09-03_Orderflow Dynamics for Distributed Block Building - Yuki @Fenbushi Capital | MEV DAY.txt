thank you for coming and I'm Yuki and uh today I'll be talking about a distributed block building some some designs around the distributed lobbying as well as the autoflow problems around the distributed barbarians and I guess I hope that after this talk you guys would have a bit more understanding around one distributable building and two some of the I guess big challenges that that it's facing uh going forward and also just to disclaimer like I'm not here necessarily to specifically you know show about Suave or anything but you know it's certainly related okay so um like I just want to ask you have anyone like seen this this graph before um perhaps yeah cool cool well you know today I just wanted to like modify this because uh I wanted to better illustrate some of the issues that I wanted to point out which was uh I kind of like draw it here so uh essentially um the current Builder Landscapes I kind of like colored oh this is easy to see the car oh it's kind of hard to see anyway so so I was I colored this uh Builders uh graph with like all of the stakeholders within this ecosystem uh in in green and then red and then yellow I'm not sure if you can see the red but supposedly the builders and relays are red um and the and the reason why I kind of put it there is because uh out of all of the stakeholders that we have um like relays and the builders are right now are the most centralized and also the trusted parties among the rest and uh and that's basically like uh as you can see like it's a they are very big part of the ecosystem when you look at the the sort of the points that they're interacting with yet we are still not really there in terms of decentralizing all those players that are playing such a key roles and that's why also I wanted to show briefly that the stats around the block review market share so I guess it started from the Builder side I mean if you look at this top four Builders including flashbots and maybe Beaver build guys I'm not sure if you're here but um but essentially already dominates around like 79 so it's like 80 of the market share now what does this 80 mean this 80 means that if you if you let's say send your bundles to all of those four Builders you have a 80 chance of inclusions for the next upcoming slots so so that's probably the the better way to to think about this number in context hand you have like relays that are also fair this interest but also on the relay side there's only like what seven seven big relays to ever exist so uh and and if in total they also control about like 74 of the orderful that it's going through so uh this this number in context basically means that 74 of the orderful that are submitted to the networks are going through these four relays that we see in the space um so so it like the point that I wanted to make here is like it's it's pretty centralized like I think um um and uh within the ethos of like uh ethereum um for broader decentralization and better liveness assumptions um it is uh crucial that uh we strive towards uh more decentralized Futures uh even in the stacks related to uh block Builder especially uh relays in the future may change a bit with epbs but especially on the bulk Builder size uh it will persist and it will have to be a better uh designed going forward and which is why you know swap guys are also working tirelessly on a lot of the initiatives around that so I guess um uh a few points I wanted to make why even these interest block Builders um well first point uh the lack of credible neutrality uh I think and put it in a simple way like a reputation based neutrality is essentially the same thing as saying trust me bro neutrality and uh and that is basically no neutrality um I mean like you you can go look at Beaver build and uh um and other like even like solvers or whatever like that are claiming to be neutral they they always have disclaimer at the end of the dog saying hey hey I'm I'm neutral you know I'm not uh trying to around basically but that's basically trusting the words and that's why like I'm saying trust me bro neutrality is what we have today and most of the time and then that's another big bit of decentralized Builders here is a lower hurdle to search Rebuilders so I think Dan briefly referred as well that with the distributed block Builders you you can lower the hurdles for entries to Searchers who can basically have more access to the slots within the Box space and then the last thing oh not the last thing the second last thing is the censorship resistant um actually like I have to mention that it doesn't actually help too much with decentralization in terms of censorship resistance and part of it is because like most of the censorship or the biggest part of the censorship that exists on ethereum is like economic censorship and oftentimes economic censorship is not necessarily just the issue around like all these interests in popular roles how about having said that it is true that if you have like only four parties that are controlling like most of the market share then it's it's a lot easier to to bribe those four known parties over you know a bunch of other nodes that are running within the networks that maybe not even known in the in the public uh so it helps but it doesn't solve the complete and then obviously the regulatory censorship issues uh as as mentioned like the geographical decentralizations uh is is another big factors associated with it and then lastly is the anti-fragility uh I mean this is like basically saying like hey we should have a better liveness assumptions around a lot of the block building features like once we lose all those big big bonds I mean let's just say one day like I I nuked like couple you know big Builders and I boom they're gone like I think the the we're gonna have a you know interesting latency on ethereum at that point so um like that's just like a lot of the liveness assumptions and anti-fragility aspect that we should also consider for a lot of the distributed block builders so that's why I'm interested and and a lot of people uh working on these problems queuing decentralized I think I'm gonna uh kind of like just briefly go through the the I guess the T model that uh swath kind of alluded to and also I wanted to today introduce a little bit more about the the threshold encryption the the threshold encryption or the I guess the MPC based approach um and then lastly we'll we'll briefly talk about uh the the leveraging on the Pepsi uh with the parallel and sequential structure so um I guess with the T model I'm just gonna kind of go over how roughly it works so uh first of all uh you will have like a network of te nodes that are running the the strict ships or whatever and then this node uh because uh it it does hold a lot of the states uh it I'm assuming that this te knows will be stateful and that they can perform uh or if they different types of LFA plus bundle merging algorithms on top of it builders that are basically submitting their bundles their transaction their order flow to the to the nodes and so essentially uh uh after the transaction is submitted the bundles emerge or if it's performed then the T nodes would essentially compute all of the Merkel routes for storage and balance and transactions and that at that this this uh block header with the Mercury would be then submitted to the proposal proposers who would then say okay I'm going to commit to this and then eventually uh uh the the T node would reveal everything and say hey this this is the block body and then now we know that okay this is this is actually what's what's been merged in bundled in the network some challenges obviously um so as um as mentioned like yes there's a lot of problems with the um you know I'm not sure if you guys aware that even last month that there was the downfall attack that happened well that was discovered uh within the te space that you know obviously Andrew Miller is like immediately you know went ahead and like patched it and with an amazing job but again like there's always like unknown uh bugs that are coming up on the t space that is like every year getting discovered so there's some risk associated with that and obviously as as mass have alluded to Oram helps and other types of hardening helps but it's not perfect um and then I guess another thing is maybe like a little bit on the latency overhead with Asterix it's not as big of a issue comparatively but it does it does add a bit of like latency uh especially considering that uh you know people who are running a centralized Builders does have less latency overhead well compared to like ones that are running sgx for example and and the latency overhead can deter can varies depending on how many calls you're making between the untrusted party and trusted enclaves so if you have a lot of like uh program a lot of calls between programs outside of the enclaves and inside of enclaves you're going to incur a lot more overhead as well and also the size of the program matters so if you have a I don't know if you're running a gas or whatever like it's a surf 30 size program then yes there's going to be a fairly sized overhead on that in terms of latest results and I guess uh this is probably more like a narrative public perception thing but yes there's like a a bit of like a Optics where people think that the OT is not safe or whatever uh even though like it's it's it's it's fairly well protected but you know the the the optic doesn't doesn't help too much and I think depending on the mode of operations it can still be centralized uh as well um which you know we'll we'll see uh how the implementation actually works but uh but yeah technically with with the centralized uh TT it can still do the jobs so centralized is is also a possible possible options so I also wanted to discuss a little bit more about the MPC base uh uh threshold encryption approach so uh I put like optimistic here because this model assumes that uh assumes that the NPC NPC nodes do not perform uh uh perform validation of the of the states and um so I guess I'll just say go through from the top so essentially you'll have Searcher builders that are uh that are performing either their own OFA on their you know option computer or maybe on Suave or whatever doing their own own AFL stuff and then could be going through like map sure whatever and then they will submit the transactions uh uh the bundles or the the order flow to the the to the NPC Network now the transaction will be encrypted with the encryption key and then the MPC Network would basically perform a greedy knapsack uh auctions uh across all of the bundles that all of the autofill that comes through and that way basically they will try to like optimize the the merge uh the bundle merging within the MPC Network and then um uh either so so there there's two two possible routes here either the MPC itself uh have to be stateful to compute the block header for all of the Merkel trees that needs to be submitted to the proposers or you could actually leverage something like Suave to basically perform those block header computes um elsewhere so like like here to essentially perform all of the block header and then submit that to the proposals as a sort of like a way to get that now I put the proposal here also as a conditional commitments because if you if you build block in an optimistic manner then you could also get this interesting feature with Pepsi where you could actually say that hey I didn't check it's kind of like optimistic relay I didn't check the entire validity of the transactions but I I want to have someone else check could be proposers or whatever to make sure that the transactions have added and if not then then you can scrap away entire block so it's kind of like the Pepsi here a Pepsi use case here where you enforce some sort of conditional commitments by the uh by the proposers such that such that the MPC node can can itself not maintain the states because maintaining States within NPC can be very heavy so that's why like doing this a bit more optimistically kind of helps reduce a lot of the uh the burden so that is associated with uh maintaining the states and Computing the Merkel routes and whatnot right it's a lot of heavy stuff um and then so so that's the that's the second one um I guess the challenge here is that uh as I mentioned like the The Proposal commitment needs to be conditional and then um there is going to be significant latency overhead from just the communications between uh the the NPC nodes and also the sharing the secrets sharing the secrets but however it helps it does achieve the reduction of the te so so within this scheme um you do have less Reliance I guess a Reliance of Lte notes which is or definitely uh Better In terms like more and more more neutral as a box Builder and then uh this also helps actually requires a by by Nature it requires decentralizations to begin with so NPC based Earth uh bulk building would be decentralized uh on on the get-go essentially um and then yeah uh conditional commitments I guess um one thing I would just like want to add is that um in terms of like how neutral the block Builders can be it's like it's like it's like a spectrum and on one hand you have the most centralized builders that are like just trusted and then on the other hand you have as decentralized as possible and as as trustless as possible and I believe that npc-based solutions by far is probably the the most trustless or the trust minimized options that we have in the space while the te based ones like probably like sitting somewhere in the middle in the Spectrum and then the last one I wanted to kind of go over is the slot auction um and I hear I said like it could be sequential or it could be a parallel through auctions uh and then they kind of have a different implication depending on what uh what what model that you're going for but so uh I guess uh should I say application of Pepsi because you're now asking the proposal here to essentially make commitments to split the block into different slots and then you auction it out based on whatever properties that you're looking for and I guess one of the suggestions that I think Barnaby also made was a usage of like top and Rob market like a Top-Up block market and and the rest of the block Market separations and uh obviously I think there's a lot of like research that needs to go into that as well so so just to kind of like go over so basically proposal can partition the blocks into uh different portions the search Rebuilder would be able to basically bid for the a slot and then each each search Builder can also enforce its own OFA okay based on like Suave or whatever we'll commit to the winning winning bidders block either sequentially or in parallel and I guess one thing that I wanted to mention here is that the slow auction can be incorporated with other types of distributed Builders so I guess here I kind of wanted to introduce the idea that with distributed block Builders we may see a composability with it within the bulk Builder space that we may not have had a much currently and then that would be possible going forward with this kind of like design place so so like more like composable block building but there's obviously challenges um and one of the issues around like the slots design is like how can we even determine the slots like are we I was just going to say that oh 10 of the the gas from the top of the block is going to be the the the Tob and then the rest of the 90 is going to be Ro b or are we gonna like have some sort of mechanism like erp1559 type of things to dynamically adjust the the slot uh with or or what like this this determination of the thoughts in my opinion is still like very much open-ended uh so so probably a lot more work and then think it needs to go into that means it's like a it's like a predicting block of value as which in essence is a block space future uh because you are you are trying to see ahead of the uh the block space and say okay this block will probably worth this much so I would bid this much value and um I mean it's good and bad because there's some predictability to the cost of the block slot but at the same time it also adds um uh should I say like inefficiency to that because ideally the block value should be you know as close to the to the to the the actual the map value as possible so so there's that and then another thing that uh I I guess I will just uh potential uh overhead if you're performing like sequential uh block options so that that's also why like some some may argue that okay parallel is more uh practical versus sequential is like you have to do it one by one and and whatnot um but oh I I think one more thing I have to add here is that parallel auctions uh would also get into the problem of of like okay uh I'm I'm the proposal are making commitments to this uh this much of transactions in the condition that no other transactions before this is like conflicting with it so that's also like another constraint that is adding to the parallel auction so both of which have some challenges but uh but it's also uh further a work of research to be done on that so by this point I wonder um how how to compete against centralized Builders right so practically today like centralized Builders are like like this you know like this beefy ass you know like super latency optimized right and then and then on the other end you have a distributed blog Builders like it's so sad you know like little little high latency so like how do we even compete with that and I I think this is this problem like is is like even to this day it's like somewhat um in my opinion somewhat unanswered uh because uh there's a lot of assumptions that we have to make about the market structure in order for the distributed block Builder to really uh make sense and prosper in the future and distributed blood Builder is not necessary I think that is absolutely necessary but uh but there is also uh aspect of like how can we align the incentive better such that distributed block Builder would just like uh I guess Prosper on its own so I guess uh just want to say like regarding the current uh block building space if we think of if we think of all those candies are like all of the order flow that we see on the Public Public mempool and whatnot then this is what's happening with with all of the centralized Builder taking dominant dominance on the top of block Marketplace a Topper block market and then at this current scenario I I highly doubt that uh that the distributed block Builders can like sort of disrupt the market that the the way it wants but here are the assumptions that I think will help distributed blog Builders to prosper in the future is the value of credible neutrality so I believe that the as more Builders becomes integrated where they are doing both the searching and block building and and even tradings as maybe Max have alluded to like our sink and beaver build guys are you know they have some training partnership they are called integrated builders in a sense that they bring their own order flow the more Builders are existing like that there there's a question that pops up in the space where we where we ask am I competing against the Builder that I'm sending the bundles or not and that's often a question that a lot of the trading firms a lot of Searchers ask themselves and what do they do they have to actually check check out try to send all of the bundles across all of the builders and say which Builders is actually not including my transactions because by doing so I can actually tell that oh yeah this guy is like trying to  with me so I'm not going to send my bundles to this Builders and that's basically like the the issues around credible neutralities and the lack of it can results in the behavior like oh I'm I'm just gonna try to find whoever is not competing with me whoever is not integrated Builders such that they can create include my bundles and then I guess another aspect is around the narratives and Optics so it I in my opinion I agree like critical neutralities is a is a bit more like a vague terms but being as being as neutrally uh like neutral Builder as possible in my opinion is also a big ads considering the fact that uh we have had uh players I mean including flashbots and block native and a few other guys have done like ofax censorship uh for understandable reasons and um and and that obviously you know harms the neutrality and but the but the more so it harms the fact that people just see simply don't like sensory Builders or like builders that are censoring so what happens is that uh people just say okay yeah this guy is essentially I don't want to send my bundles to any sensory in Builders I prefer to have someone that is like non-cessary to include my transactions so what what ended up happening in that case is that even though the ofax censorship list is like maybe 10 addresses or 20 addresses which is like tiny but the optic of it just drives a lot of people away from sending the bundles in order for two to those Builders and that's again why I think that the credible neutrality aspect matters oh I guess I'll also add that another another reason why that the ofax sensoring builders tend to have a harder bottle uh battle is because uh some some people just don't want to even like filter the bundles because that's the added latency within the second latency game so so they just wanna don't bother with it another assumptions that I wanted to discuss here is the value of a slot over a value of a block so as I mentioned distributable building at the end of the day is chopping up a lot of The Chopping out a massive block of transactions now a bulk of a block space into a smaller chunks that can now be controlled and and and determined by different actors in this space and which I call Searcher builders and um this again would enable more composable block building schemes like those that I kind of listed and obviously this is like a very like high level uh abstraction of it and a lot of details need to be more laid out but uh I believe that a lot of the implementation saw auctions with Suave and other types of like distributed Builders come into the space uh more composable types of block building activities can be uh can be put can can become possible in the future and then um I guess uh the last the the last point on this assumptions that I also wanted to discuss discuss is around the um the distributed block Builders allowing sort of like a byof uh uh or more encouraging more byof activities so instead of like bringing your own boost you're bringing your own order flow basically um and um and that's kind of like where you have let's say like a Dap wallets um or or dab relayer or dap specific OFA that is bringing in their own order flow directly to this distributed distributed block Builders where they can actually have a dedicated dedicated block spaces where they can do stuff and then the the third assumptions that I have here is uh the different latency game so I guess one of the reason that uh a lot of the latency game exists in the in the in in this in the space is because one uh every transaction is is publicly available in the main pool um so so so basically a lot of the transactions you see and then the fastest you simulate the transactions and and and make it into bundle uh or or make into the block you win so there's a latency aspect to open informations two the there's a latency aspect to the to the transaction itself where this transaction is trying to execute some sort of like six decks Arbitrage and you have to make sure that these transactions have to be at the top of the box otherwise someone else is going to capture that opportunity and you're gonna miss out on those big fat uh up revenues so I put it here that integrated Builders those who are doing tradings and searching and whatnot will be as latency since it's sensitive as the autofill itself and in other words latency matters less if the order flow doesn't have to be on the top of the block now this is not to say that all of the autofill that are like that are less latency sensitive don't have to be on tlb but there are a subset of overflows that can you know that still has a lot of math value but doesn't have to necessarily be on top and uh and if you have a a sort of a proprietary access to that specific order for and other people don't then the latency in that case would matter a lot less as long as the information itself is not latency sensitive so that's why I said integrated Builders will be as latency sensitive as the order flow itself but however I do want to mention that but but this leads to the to the issues around the Tob dominance of uh top integrated builders in the space because uh right now the current block building landscape is that most of the uh most of the top Builders are integrated Builders and that they dominate the the top of block topper block fee market and that if within the current block building space if you win the top of block fee Market you basically win the rest of the rest of the rest of the block so there is some concerns around like okay how can we break this dominance of Tob centralized block Builders uh going forward and I guess I I just want to say a lot of the assumptions that I mentioned here are all like sort of like uh composing with each other meaning that uh projects may prefer to have incredibly neutral Builders hence they want to prefer to use something you know like a distributed World Builders and um you know they value the slot over the block and they they might also participate in OFA within a certain distributed World Builders so again like all of this composing with each other as a more unified advantage that the distributed Builder would have over centralized by computer so I guess to in a in a more like a nuanced way to present it I I I foresee that uh the future would look a bit more like okay you have a bunch of like a big ass you know centralized uh block Builders uh but at the same time you know some order flow right some order flow would take some opinionated positions on how they want to even distribute their order flow to the public and hence you see some sort of like a rock as a Guardians to essentially like you know order uh to put perform some sort of a and then put down to you know those little uh distributed builders that are sitting you know around the corners but but again I believe that the space will be quite a Nuance going forward as well some open questions so I think I I I I believe that there's a lot of challenges like a lot of challenges uh ahead for distributed bodybuilders but um I think uh there's also a lot of like open research questions so first of all it's like with the Advent of slot auctions um uh with the advantage of Tob dominance uh diminish so if if let's say uh what Barnaby is trying to do with you know the the top of block fee market and rest of the block fee Market would actually become reality then how does that impact let's say the the tlb dominance that is currently present presented by the centralized bodybuilders uh and then another thing is like can a credibly neutral builders provide enough advantages of order flow aggregation when competing with big non non-neutral or or integrated Builders I think that that one is like God knows advantages either that I did exist ahead in in the race forward as well um I guess one more thing that I wanted to mention is that I think uh this this is probably also like a common to flash plus guys so I think a flashbulse right now I believe is not winning as much tlb Market as well so that to me is actually a bit of a concern because um you know with with with flash floods being able to win Tob is also a leverage moving towards the distributed block building race so I think uh I I do encourage you know flash plus guys to be you know up there block building game as well [Laughter] okay so thanks for listening uh and uh yeah yeah thank you [Applause] any questions um yeah when it comes to the distributed Builders competing with centralized Builders perhaps is there any way we can do commercialization so it means that the public might have a chance to invest into great distributed Builders which we need to entitle to some future income compared to the centralized Builders where it'll become really dressed was wondering if we can limit the success of distributed stakers but obviously it has two different volumes oh as in like people would uh I don't know put steak onto like a distributed about Builders yeah I mean I feel like that's probably more on the The Golden Market strategy side of things like it it's certainly a one possible way which they can like aggregate a lot of waterfalls but I don't think it's a it's a very sustainable way either because uh um if if the biggest order for Originators are not staking or or putting their money into your protocol then basically you get you get however much money that you aggregate it doesn't correlate to the amount of autofill that you actually get for the for the distributable operators so even if like you get like I don't know 200 million 300 million tvl that is staked on on a distributed ball Builder that doesn't necessarily mean that you are more competent against a beaver build so it's like it's like a very orthogonal in my opinion yeah um yeah I was wondering if you could talk more about how you see like the market structure of the top of block um because I yeah I think there's some things that don't make sense to me like um but I I haven't like read any of the proposals or anything so um like the main advantage is that like right now if you're competing in top of block and you're a block Builder you just own the whole block even if you win the top right so the the key part is like separating them but if all the order flow is still going to like one Builder it still effectively feels the same and then also like I don't know thoughts come to mind of like okay so if I have a higher tip in a in this you know the rest of block option that the tip and the top of block like do I still stay lower yeah or like what if I'm also like let's say the top of block is a you know Dex trade yeah yeah it's like an oracle like if I want to do both do I have to now compete in both yeah get like combinatorial yeah so so that's again like I think that's uh exactly why like um it's a it's it's still very much open-ended in terms of like how do we even go about this top level and then just just want to add that so besides the fact that top of block would enable uh well topper blocks and a rest of the Box separation would enable like the I guess the diminishing of the powers in terms of the the block Builders because now you you're splitting these two such that one Builder winning the top of ball doesn't win the rest of the buck right so that that's fair but also another Advantage is that people are anticipating with this is that reduction of the fees so you you let the competition to to happen more in a siled manner such that they can like uh reduce the for the rest of the block but that's also not very Complete because as you said you could have overfill where you set this to 10 or whatever but it can always overflow across across the rest of the block which basically means that you ended up having the same gas gas V curves or the bidding fee curves where people just bit like a you know like exponentially High towards the towards the top of the box so so yeah I think there's still very much open research question like the if efficiency of the Tob and RB but having said that I I do think that regardless of how lower the fee can go uh Tob and RB can help reduce the dominance of the top of block bidders and builders in the space yeah so so it leads more it leads more value for The distributable Operators actually prospered going forward yeah any more questions then I do have more questions come to Yuki and we have our final guest uh Sam from skit protocol and we will start in 15 minutes so feel free to just [Applause]
