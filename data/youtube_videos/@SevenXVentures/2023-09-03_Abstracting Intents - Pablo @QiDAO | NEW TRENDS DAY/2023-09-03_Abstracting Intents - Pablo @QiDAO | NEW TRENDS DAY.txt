everybody I'm Pablo and uh yeah this is a quick presentation on abstracting intents so it's cool now that we have intents and we have all these systems and infrastructure but what happens when you know rubber hits adapt um I'm Pablo the Penguin online and I'm a coder at chidao my finance we're a stable clean protocol we are available in a bunch of different chains we use the ERC 721 standard to nfts for Lending for CDP lending so users to pass a collateral they mint my it's available in a bunch of different chains you can trade it you can swap it you can Bridge it we use a lot of different partners like layer 0 squid and axelr and it's very multi-chain as you might have been have a scene so basically with that comes a lot of responsibility for users lending can get very complex especially when you get a bunch of different collaterals and a bunch of different chains a user comes in and says I want to do this well what is this is it that you know you can borrow from one collateral another you can access extra yield and curve or beefy or Ave but all of that gets very complex for the end user and all sorts of protocols have tried many different things whether it's maker Dao building automations or curve trying to do automated liquidations or sapping sapping has been the first thing that we as a protocol have taken over which takes on the idea of you know depositing as the eth which is a liquidity Pro liquidity pool within uh curve and well the user has to go then on beefy to take that asset and compound it but then they go on beefy and instead of depositing they have to add liquidity and then to add liquidity they gotta go on curve and then they have to approve as you can see the deposit then they go back here and then they borrow that's very complex for many users even though we have a few million dollars for this specific vault which is very popular in optimism um our solution was to introduce sappers to the equation instead of having many approved some many transactions we have one approved and that approve takes those transactions and merges it into one now that's currently the most popular option given the eoas and the account abstractions you guys might have seen and heard throughout the week and that's kind of the backbone of it you just automate a lot of features and kind of let the user do a thing but there's always a but and the butt comes in whenever Regulators step in especially in things like Oasis which hit him so bad they had to Rebrand to summerify where this system enabled people to use maker in a quick way creating your Vault doing the borrowing and automating all those strategies suddenly those strategies could be updated by a multi-sig which could be compelled by a court and suddenly the assets were lost within what a hacker but at the end of the day a user so if somebody didn't like you they could potentially take your assets so those are the current shortcomings for implementations that happen today many solutions you've seen well manually step by step going to different websites you can aggregate them on one site as you saw with a sappers that we've used and then you have all sorts of other things but they're dependent on what chain you're on whether you're on CK sync and you can potentially do those kind of abstractions or you have to use an extra wallet and suddenly you have your eoa on your Ledger you have an avocado instance on Instagram or something else there's just many many options so initially what we're looking at to improve ux is outline these steps required for a user and bring it into one place that makes it easier for the end users so they don't have to know do I go to beef feed do I go to curve do I go to axelr to swap but never mind axler took down the page now I have to go to squid router so there's so many options let's reduce that and give it to the user on the single page that makes it a little easier now with intents you bring in an extra level of option so these options can be where do I lend or where do I swap I don't necessarily care as an end user that I go to Quick swap in polygon or that I go to uh Aerodrome on base chain I just want to swap so you can build intents around certain routes that the user takes as well as add-on the idea of invariance where particles have a specific in and out so when you interact with VC or Ave you know you're going to deposit you're going to withdraw you don't necessarily need to know anything else and the Searcher doesn't need to figure out how to deposit and how do we draw so you can handle that on your own and so you can declare different ideas so for example this is defalama you have a ton of different solutions or yield opportunities and you can Define the way that you interact with those yield opportunities now pair that up with an intent and you can say I need to get formatic to sdeath to go here and so the easy way to do that would be writing some sort of configuration and so what we're looking at is just a yaml file markup language looking at the in and the out for a specific contract so now we can standardize these interactions so the users well users and websites can access them without needing to build a custom contract and then rely on another Custom Contract and approve it and another wallet so that allows us to then have little tools for the user where how do I interact with beefy how to interact with maker etc etc and you can basically chain those strategies so now you can know how to get from point A to point B which is kind of important if I want to play on front economic what do I do well I can use the Searcher to figure out let me get some tokens there are certain ways to interact with Bridges they're standard and they're one way technically to bridge into base chain you can just use the main Bridge and then you can transfer to the account those are basic things that are set in stone so you can kind of rely on them and just interact um high level this was a relatively quick presentation we want to scale beyond having to know all these different websites you don't need to know which website you're going to swap on which website you're going to bridge on you just want to get to the product whether it be friend tag or it would be some other nft game you want to be able to access it directly and that's what we're building out on the on the background for cheetah and creating a a mechanism that everyone can integrate with and collaborate on [Applause] here oh yeah questions yeah can you talked about a lot of chains yeah and you're interacting with multiple genes and intense you want to Define issue correctly you want to make this kind of routing United experience more streamlined producer so they don't really have to think about it right they express what they want to do to you in a certain way but then you execute that right right on behalf of it in our case initially we let the user execute on on their own because we yeah right so how much a user has to figure out so from the user perspective they just go to the page and they say I want to access this Vault or this specific lending yeah right so you have a flow okay and so then you can Define well you get the user's balances and you can figure out where in that flow they are and so you can skip steps generalized they cannot just say anything that they want to do right right so you would Define either you would Define beefy and with those definitions you can trust that and who serves on the other side on the afternoon part will be each uh partner so every protocol would have their own configuration for the way that you interact with the protocol and they would maintain that so some set of storage here or a builder will make sure that gets through an approach to get back into together under the chain so you don't really have a camera maybe the protocols need to have that Partners right right okay some a protocol will tell you like here this is how you enter this is how you exit but it reduces the overhead for all these Protocols of creating about yeah right because then you can figure out well now we know which Landing Protocols are there how do we interact with them they're all slightly different yeah yeah so are you sort of building a set of UI components for like purposes or D5 so for us yeah we're going to be building a few UI components whether it be like let's figure out what the user has let's streamline it but initially it's uh simpler and it's going to be outlining what addresses that does the user hold and how uh which ones are available within our protocol so we have like 60 plus different addresses on different chains so you get the address of the user and get their balance and filter out the UI the UI similar to what we have right now on beefy Finance where you can look at what what's available for you whether it's something that you have because you deposit it or something that you could have because it's available in your balance
