so my name is Eric from dodo I'm a head of strategy today I'm just going to talk about the intent based D5 protocol design so I think inkten based product has already been in this space for quite a long time so uh today I'm just going to explore some of the kind of existing examples and and also trying to predict some interesting new protocol designs and also presenting like the new version of DOTA which also around a intense Centric so um I guess we think so what does kind of a like generalized intent look like suppose you want to buy some like a baseball ticket and you want certain constraints and you want to several seats together whatever and you want and you specify your budget limit now like 200 bucks and then for this type of things it's not really far away from uh you know the the crypto world because you can if you imagine that um these uh Events maybe they're token gated and all the tickets are actually kind of an nft and then you're simply just actually express your intent to buy these nft tickets and then someone would fulfill to you if they actually to see there is a you know an Arbitrage to be to be taken so this is uh like a an ft file like a token training now let's think about something more um you know a basic I would say um about the uh singpo D5 use cases where which involves some um you know a little bit intense for example first case would be you know you can run a transaction when the gas is low enough and I'm sure that in the boot time then when God showed up high you often have to wait until it drops and do something but if you do a kind of intent based kind of thing and you can specify okay I'm just willing to pay like a 20 gas fee in any token and then they can have it the silvers can actually have it down for you when the gas is low because when the gas price drop below 20 dollars they see an opportunity to take in some profit and there's around it for you and then you can also think about out doing like a compounding like claim reward sound risk and this normally Downs using another I mean contract to do that but you can also use an intent base to incentivize the solvers to do it for you and the third use case will be like airdrop farming and in that case like when you go to a specific new chain and you will like to do some like uh meets their criteria you probably want to do some you know volume based trading you want to swap selling token index a you can't one Bridge token to a specific chain and swap token do LPS and then do some Landing scenes and which can be probably having to one single bracket someone did it for you and it's very very simple you don't have to spend your like a lot of time to uh to do so if you specify your intent another one would be you can kind of a mimic a centralized exchange the function you can sort of I mean like I mean circular exchange because there's no gas therefore a lot of things that can be uh Dan Ely for example you can do kind of basic Market making in a centralized exchange where you can follow and sell high but it can also uh you know man you also need to go to these accounts to listing these others but what if you can actually set up some conditional intents which kind of uh linked through each other it's also the best point of a sequential intents would be one intense follow followed by the uh the the the the the previous one which has been met so for example you can sell your CRM and 2000 and then have this next thing to anyone I want to buy at like 1800 etc etc so these are the some of the simple use cases um and then we have already been seeing a lot of uh intense based use cases existing right now and then most predominant one I guess 90 percent of chance when you talk about intense a probably are like just a limit orders which means that you want to buy x amount of token with an 8X amount of a token with one amount of B tokens and then you already see a lot of a leading I guess protocols already doing this one like uni swap X cow swap one inch and then they also they're kind of doing like a uh an RFQ model with like the silver to saddle these uh buy and style uh otters so um but this is just actually a a tip of the iceberg for um you know the use cases of this intent thing so this really there are other protocols in the D5 can actually use uh the intent based uh mechanism so for example P2P Landing which probably won't see that much in D5 in nft5 that you are doing a lot of things is expressing your intent to to land some to borrow some ethereum with your nfts as collateral or you're willing to land some etherium and on the specific nft basically so these are an intent um yes and then the silver can actually in this case they can compete each other and really they can actually find some you know interest rate difference here and then um foreign liquidation of a landing protocol it's already actually in the in the intent base because uh really uh the intent here is like as it's like a conditional intensity when collateralization ratio drops to like 120 percent I would like to uh you know sell this collateral so that I can get uh you know the capital back to cover the uh the the lender's money and then by doing so I mean okay you can get like 10 of this profit so let's incentivize the liquidation Bots all the solvers to to do so and then when you come into the uh the yard uh protocols like um there are a lot I mean I'm gonna talk about a bunch of strategies like ABCD and then and the intent will be like okay I the user don't know that which one would uh generally have a better yell or they they don't want to bother to do the portfolio management what they simply like said okay I just want to optimize for my return but uh just using the following strategies and then the difference between these type of intents and with the actual swap intenses because for the swap or the other things they have a very fixed outcome which you definitely you can determine uh who can be the winner because Asana someone actually offered higher price you definitely would go for that but for the yell you probably want to think about other ways so maybe it's more kind of like a interest rate swap where the solver first would give you some stable income say like three percent to four percent but which is fixed and you are actually going to get a stable income but when they talk you're uh the the money they have to invest in the the certain strategies but whatever the loss or uh the game they they take they have to uh they have to take it but they could end up with maybe say 10 which they actually can get a uh you know a profit from that or you can probably lose from that because simply these strategy doesn't actually uh yell that much but in this case it's more like interest rate swap a user wanted to have a more stable uh they want to sacrifice the potential of getting a higher yield but they want to have some stable income for that um and then also uh this one is very interesting for the the lp and so um I there are a lot of you know projects um they were doing liquidity management I don't say for example when you spot these three and what they do is that they have a smart contract and then they have some like a rebalancing rules and once these like conditions are met these they will actually Auto rebalance your um you know the URL piece and this helping the management of that but the problem is that there's so many kind of strategy on Market makings these days and implementing these um new strategy taking a lot of times and also like uh these strategy actually kind of evolved over time therefore why don't we just Outsourcing these strategy to a a server they don't have to actually have all the rebalancing rules on a smart contract but they just uh off chain but they just uh you know provide uh the there's a rebalancing strategy at the time of the the the rebalancing yeah okay so now we're we look at a couple you know a few cases of these defying tents and now we actually do a summarize of their characteristics so uh so what I found is that there's there are three kind of uh you know characteristics for this first one is that um there's a Trends to Outsourcing more like complex trying to like a professional Silvers where they can tend to specialize in this one sometimes actually have a better price which allows a better outcome and also would reduce the operational risks in a for example in the case of a cow swap a user can actually also avoid Mev attack using calcium as well secondly users are willing to compensate silver for their service and get a much stable yeah so for example if in the amm models they encounter like a slippage or something they're not uncertain but for the uh for the intent limit otter they can actually get a specific price so it's much predictable out and also secondly the third one is the competition between the the solvers so will drive even better outcome for a user so if in a healthy like a competition environment that there are a lot of silver for the user definitely the their profits will be much thinner which means that the the the outcome for the user will be will be much better it's it's kind of similar as if they do it themselves then why don't they just pay just a little bit of money to you know have a professional do it for them um yes so all these things like I was trying to talk about here is um dodo has actually also developing a um in intense Centric like protocols which actually do share the similar characteristics of these three here and then it's uh scotodo V3 and we haven't have a uh actual name for that yeah we have been working on this a new version for the past seven months and then it's currently in a beta testing and hopefully the it will be released to public by the end of next month so for total V3 is a leveraged Market making pool for market makers where we actually don't call well actually refer to this Market maker as SP or strategy providers or solvers in this case if you want and then and the LPs they don't actually Supply uh you know the in the tokens into the pool you know they don't Supply the the pairs into the pool they only Supply single token pool and then get a stable yard for the normal user so um so what it does is actually the strategy provider is a borrow assets from the uh the lp the large LP pool to to do the market making and share the profits with our peace and so that LPS has stable income and they don't have to suffer as a premium loss so what we um for the past two years we've been dealing with the the market makers that we we close work with we findings that they're constantly making a decent amount of API while the retail user they don't know how to do the rebalancing they're constantly suffer the Improvement loss and then at the end of the day that we think that why don't we just design a protocol that let users to land the market maker money and let the professional do their own things to uh to do the market making so um yeah this is about these three so I can't use the graph to explain it it's more so their market makers here they're the like the The Pool owners and then when they can create a specific pull to Market to make South these these pools are uh mixed token pools to uh increase the capital efficiencies and um they can this pool they have to deploy a uh a margin into the pool first and then they have to use their LP position as the collateral because at the end of the day it's a kind of a landing product a product we have to um you know make sure that our retail user can we will make them whole if the market maker there's some that have some loss incurred in the market making and then they're also a liquidation process will trigger if there margin is kind of a drop to like 120 percent they're only 30 off the entire portfolio and so we will guarantee that the um the the retail user gets their money back um so when they have the they have a lot of Market maker and each market makers they can spin up different number of pools and but they actually Landing the money from the the same same pool for uh for for the LPS um so the the the reason why that you want to use actually the beauty of Dodo V3 is that is actually for others and other Landing protocols because when you put a collateral the collateral is sitting there idle they don't do anything but if you use the lp position as the collateral they can actually do Market making at the same time therefore it's increasingly Capital efficiency um now we kind of have those things and we kind of introduce the these strategy providers to have a competition with within themselves so firstly there's a based interest rate for all the all the fans taken out from the pool and then once the uh capitalizes uh this Capital utilization ratio raises the base interest World also increase and once uh because if you think about if they're um you know there are two strategy or two um strategy two market makers one of them is super profitable what they were going to do is they're actually going to lend more money from the pool and then decrease the utilization ratio and after that the base interest rate would also increase which for the other one didn't perform well would actually have more cost of Market making and then it will be literally um uh they could drive out of the the market uh therefore it's kind of a more a Dynamics to optimization for uh for the best Market maker and for the best Market making strategy this will push for like the optimal return for the entire liquidity pool and then and additionally we're also adding a little bit another feature is that when these Market maker actually make money say they make 50 or 60 apis the LPS also can enjoy a bonus based on their performance as well so which means that like only the best strategy would exist and then this would also benefits the the LPS um yes as you can see it's kind of um if you if I go back say that it's kind of uh meets these kind of three criterias which I really Define for the defy intense was first is to Outsourcing these complex rebalancing or making strategy to professional market makers so that you can get a better outcome because instead of you just passive LP or losing money you can actually share as a market Maker's profit and also it's they're willing to compensate for the uh for the for them because eventually the market maker has to be you know making profit in order to actually land your funding or to Market make and also there are competition between these market makers strategy provider or servers which would be better uh drive better outcome for the for the users so I'll kind of Define this more it's a little bit um intense Centric like uh model for dodo V3 the intense it can be a little bit vague here it can so kind of like I try and I wanted to for a user I want to do some Market making but I don't know how to do can I just you know ask someone to Market make it for me it's something like that in time but doesn't have that specific intense thing but it's a it's yeah but you can't guess the kind of the ideology about that so um yes and then and this is uh this is the last slice actually so um what what I'm seeing this kind of uh the trend for the future of the defined tense is that um there will be more and more actually professionals that expertising specifically field and then these people um would actually uh you know uh uh yeah particularly do more related to some off-chain and methods mechanism so these people are willing to monetize um their expertise in the way that uh you know I can I can find about better outcome a better so I got better so a better outcome for the other people therefore they can't make the the money out from it and then the retail user they kind of lose the um they don't have to do the specific scenes themselves they just have to focus on Express their intent say I just wanted to borrow some money I just wanted to swap somebody I just want to have a stable yelled and then and that's it and this uh extremely I guess increased the user experience for this retail users um and then also this is and also uh what's what's what I think is very interesting as we well I think there will be more like uh you know um much complicated um intense things they could uh requires like a multi-step solutions for that and then what I think some of the solver would actually construct these multi-step intents so you we have specialized server in the specific intents but you also have you know the server on the uh you know on the on the more on the macro side they actually construct these specific uh intense at each steps and then and because because of these like sort of specialization and I would foresee there will be a increasing adoption of the intent-based mechanism across virus products and I think but once that happens there will be a um you know the need of uh like a kind of aggregation um even these days when you have Cal swap one inch and then you need swap X there wasn't I guess they have different you know interpretation there wasn't actually unified way to say for example can aggregate their server at the same time or for a server they have to onboard say both these three platform each platform they have different criteria some of them requires you to stake a large chunk of money and then also you have to you know it's definitely an increased cost for the for the maintenance as well so I think this space actually need to establish a uh more like a standardized like a framework uh seeing order to actually uh deal with the the intent so that they can actually be aggregated well I think yeah um yeah thank you and then that's uh about it some sorts of the you know intent based mechanism and and the new dodo version three yeah thank you [Applause] any pressure here yes maybe I can do a comment here so it's not a question because I'm really astonished to see what you are speaking about I want to say first thing first is that I like your idea or I should say I like renaming it as a being Centric practical I should say like we share the same vision with you we also think that a mini swap or like language or like uh it's one of the other ones oh coleslaw yeah they also oh you can see oh please enjoy example use any other I remember that yeah yeah so yeah actually yeah kind of say yes the kind of like so you really more in traditional experience but now it's it's happening I think small bathroom is to use like hook design to achieve this but I don't know it's a huge swap they just released the you know yeah before yeah yeah it's good yeah so uh I I thought I don't want to say I totally agree with your idea about this like uh they are all kind of like internet and I totally agree with you right here is that uh we make it aggregator or maybe the internal framework because like all different particles we use all different kind of framework I I write the units of before it's called and as your license is commercial license and other guys cannot use it so um yeah so actually that's why we are building uh why we are doing a framework I will also be a speaker after another one that I will speak all about power and framework to support this kind of Indian network of course yeah absolutely looking forward and Keen to see what you can present here yeah thanks thank you and the other pressures here okay thanks for your sharing okay thank you
