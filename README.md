# MEV.FYI

Welcome to `mev.fyi` - an open-source initiative dedicated to gathering and curating research on Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), incentive alignment, mechanism design, and their implications in the blockchain ecosystem, with a specific focus on Ethereum.

## What is MEV?

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the total amount that can be extracted from blockchain users by strategically ordering, including, or censoring transactions. It's an emerging area of study and concern in the blockchain space.

## Project Goals

1. **Research Aggregation**: Gather the latest and most relevant academic papers, articles, and discussions surrounding MEV and related topics.
2. **Community Contributions**: Encourage and integrate contributions from the community to ensure the repository remains updated and relevant.
3. **Education**: Educate the broader blockchain and Ethereum community about the implications of MEV and how it can shape the future of decentralized platforms.

## Where to start the MEV learning journey?
1. Flashbots' MEV [Research repository](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/) is a great place to start. It contains a curated list of academic papers, articles, and discussions on MEV and related topics.

2. Beyond Flashbots, all articles available from sources in resources.md constitute strong foundations to get started on MEV research.

3. Research papers, can be browsed on the Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1POtuj3DtF3A-uwm4MtKvwNYtnl_PW6DPUYj6x7yJUIs/edit#gid=1299175463). This file contains a list of research papers, the papers' title, authors, topics, and link.

## YouTube Video Transcripts

We've curated a selection of YouTube channels focused on MEV and related topics. Each channel's videos come with their respective transcripts to enable easy "Ctrl+F" searches. This repository offers an invaluable tool to parse video content with LLMs, create glossaries, definitions, and more.

Disclaimer: each transcript is fetched from Youtube API and automatically generated. The Google algorithm generating said scripts is imperfect and some words can be misinterpreted. A possible upgrade to the transcript would be to fetch the audio (against Google ToS however) and use an API like AssemblyAI's to analyse the content and correct the transcript.  

## Topics of Interest
Flashbots' topics and definitions list [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/blob/main/topics.md) enumerates topics of interest to the MEV research community. These topics include:
- Auction Design
- Cryptographic Privacy
- Cryptoeconomic Privacy
- MEV in L2
- MEV Taxonomy
- Account Abstraction
- Protocol Design
- Search Optimization

And, more broadly:
- Incentive Alignment in Blockchain Systems
- Mechanism Design and its Implications in Ethereum
- Transaction Ordering and its Impacts
- Auction theory and its Applications in Blockchain
- Potential Solutions and Mitigations for MEV
