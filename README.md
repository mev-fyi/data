# MEV.FYI

Welcome to `mev.fyi` - an open-source initiative dedicated to gathering and curating research on Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), incentive alignment, mechanism design, and their implications in the blockchain ecosystem, with a specific focus on Ethereum.

## What is MEV?

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the total amount that can be extracted from blockchain users by strategically ordering, including, or censoring transactions. It's an emerging area of study and concern in the blockchain space.

## Project Goals

1. **Research Aggregation**: Gather the latest and most relevant academic papers, articles, and discussions surrounding MEV and related topics.
2. **Community Contributions**: Encourage and integrate contributions from the community to ensure the repository remains updated and relevant.
3. **Education**: Educate the broader blockchain and Ethereum community about the implications of MEV and how it can shape the future of decentralized platforms.

## Where to start the MEV learning journey?
1. Flashbots' MEV [Research repository](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/) is a great place to start. It contains a curated list of academic papers, articles, and discussions on MEV and related topics.

2. Beyond Flashbots, all articles available in resources.md constitute strong foundations to get started on MEV research.

3. Research papers, can be browsed on the Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1POtuj3DtF3A-uwm4MtKvwNYtnl_PW6DPUYj6x7yJUIs/edit#gid=1299175463). This file contains a list of research papers, the papers' title, authors, topics, and link.
